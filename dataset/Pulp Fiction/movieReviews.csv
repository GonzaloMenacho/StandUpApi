4 January 2021,auuwws,34,51,9,Pulp Fiction,"One of the best movies I have ever seen is a fun and enjoyable story, as most of the film's characters were excellent, and it brought back the character of Butch and his girlfriend, Vincent was the best character and his death was shocking and I did not. Expect that, the interconnectedness of the film's stories was excellent, the direction in the film was excellent The film, the acting in the movie was very cool, I recommend it, and it is the best film by Quentin Tarantino"
14 March 2021,foxhound-37781,4,4,10,Tarantino's Absolute Best.,"What's there to say about Pulp Fiction that hasn't already been said..... Multiple tales of crime and corruption and robbery put together to create what seemingly is 3 or 4 short films that are interwoven, but done so in a way that just works so well.Shot in and around LA, every actor in this movie plays their role to absolute spot on perfection. No one feels out of place or out of character for one second of this film, and there are some serious big name actors in this considering it was only Tarantino's second film. even HE himself plays a very believable role.The only downside is sensitive folk might find it a bit gnarly hearing white people use the ""N"" word with sustained use, but it's certainly nothing that ruins the film to the state of it being unwatchable.Pulp Fiction has an awe inspiring cult following and so it should. It's just the perfect movie from the 90's. It's one of those rare gems that just has EVERYTHING on display you could ever want in a film. It doesn't feel outdated and it doesn't feel overacted. It's a little bit of a long one at 2 and a half hours long but you really don't notice it because you enjoy it so much.10/10 Could watch it endlessly and never get bored."
30 December 1998,Luke-20,663,984,10,One of the best movies of the century!,"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece."
20 April 2020,Jeremy_Urquhart,10,14,10,"Always has been, and always will be a personal favourite","Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it.One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult ""The Wolf"" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive.But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene.It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a ""Wild Bunch-esque"" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it.
And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again."
25 January 2019,maryolalov,25,38,9,A true Tarantino classic,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.
4 January 2021,scarlettwyrtzen,6,8,9,Fulp Piction,"This movie may be very ínstense but the plot is amazing. Watching movie's that go full circle like Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind or Inside Llewyn Davis.
This movie is Quentin Tarantino's best.
Mia's overdose is scary but iconic, the dance scene is probably the only reason that John Travolta got the role, or Marcellus Wallace's band aid on the back of his head.
This movie is great, a little crazy and ínstense but great. If you are still not convinced it has JOHN TRAVOLTA AND SAMUEL L JACKSON AND UMA THURMAN AND A BRIEF SCENE WITH HARNEY KEITEL AND A BREIF SCENE OF CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AND BRUCE WILIS. Oh, and Steve Buscemi plays Buddy Holly at the finer than Mis and Vincent dance at."
22 July 2019,BandSAboutMovies,7,12,10,Still perfect,"There are movies and then there are forces of pop culture nature. Pulp Fiction is just such a film. While so much before influenced it, nothing after would ever be the same. In its wake, so many films tried to xerox its non-linear narrative, ultraviolence and wildly veering plot points. Pretty much not a single one of them is halfway decent by comparison.Tarantino took some scenes that Roger Avery intended for True Romance and decided that none of the film would appear in true order. For many, it was the first film they had ever watched that had monologues and conversations that were at the same time about everything and nothing all at once. While TriStar Pictures turned down the film, it became the first movie that Miramax would fully finance.Why would TriStar not want to make this film, particularly after Tarantino had become so big after Reservoir Dogs? Roger Avary said that the studio had issues with nearly every part of the movie, as they basically said, ""This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent and unfilmable.""I wonder how the person that said that felt after Pulp Fiction was voted as the winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for seven Oscars. Obviously, this film was also a commercial success, remaking the career of John Travolta and causing people to take notice of the acting skills of Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson.There's a moment in this film that determines whether or not you like and understand Tarantino. Before they enter Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia Wallace (Thurman) asks if Vincent Vega (Travolta) is square and she illustrates that point with her fingers. Suddenly, the movie becomes animated and dashed lines illustrate her point and realism fades away. In this small moment, you either think that this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen, totally pretentious or completely and utterly awesome. I fall into the latter category and began cheering the moment it happened on screen.Pulp Fiction begins with a diner being held up by Ringo (Tim Roth, who was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer, So I Married an Axe Murderer) before we move into Jules Winnfield (Jackson) and Vega (Travolta, in a role originally intended for Michael Madsen, who had played the other Vega brother, Mr. Blonde, in Reservoir Dogs) taking a briefcase back for their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames, Con Air), after a long discussion of what McDonald's calls their food in Europe.What's in that briefcase? All that we learn is that the lock for it is 666, but it's a MacGuffin - a term invented by English screenwriter Angus MacPhail and popularized by Alfred Hitchcock. The case was originally going to have diamonds in it, but that's kind of boring. Instead, it opens to have a strange glow. Tarantino has been very coy about what it really is, even doing an interview with his friend Robert Rodriguez where they cut out the real answer before his fellow Grindhouse director says that the knowledge of what is really in the case radically changed how he saw the film.There are plenty of theories of what's really in that case. If we extrapolate that Tarantino was influenced by Kiss Me Deadly, then it's a nuclear device. It's been compared to the trunk in Repo Man. And an internet rumor began that it's really Marcellus Wallace's soul as evidenced by the band-aid on the back of his neck which is supposedly where the Egyptians believed the soul resided.The two bring the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus, but first, he bribes Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to do the job in his next match. Then, the boss goes out of town but asks Vega to show his wife a nice time. How nice of a time? After all, he threw a man out a window just for giving her a foot massage.About feet - this is the movie where Tarantino reveals his foot fetish. I'm not being rude or sly; it's 100% obvious upon watching the film.Before the date, Vega buys heroin from Lance (Eric Stoltz), who is out of balloons, so he puts it in a baggie. This will be important after the date of dinner and dancing at the aforementioned 1950's pop culture diner Jack Rabbit Slim's. Their dance scene here - taken almost move from move from Fellini's 8 1/2 scene where Barbara Steele dances with Mario Pisu - is more than just a simple physical scene. For a moment in time, it freezes reality and makes us think back to why we love Travolta the actor and not just Vincent the character that he is portraying. When we see him, we don't just see every role that he has ever played. We are fixated on the role that we first fell in love with, Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever, bringing back fond thoughts of what it was like when to see the actor on the dance floor.Vega is obviously enamored of Mia and feels that things could feel the same with her, so he plans on simply leaving. However, she snorts the heroin - thinking it's coke - and nearly dies. It takes a needle of adrenaline right to her heart to fix things, as much as they can be fixed.While all this is going on, Butch wins the fight and kills his opponent. As he escapes in a taxi, its driver (Pittsburgh native Angela Jones, who graduated from the same college that I did, Point Park, and would go on to play the same character in the film Curdled, as well as date Slash) asks him what it's like to kill a man.Butch has told his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros, who was Anais Nin in Henry and June) to get everything ready to run away, but she forgot his gold watch, which we learn his father smuggled in a very uncomfortable place, along with Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells him the story of the watch in a flashback. Butch must go back home, where he encounters Vega reading Modesty Blaise on the toilet. One barrage of bullets later and he's on the run, but when Marcellus Wallace crosses his path, he decides to hit him with his car.Both injured, Marcellus begins shooting at Butch, who runs into a pawnshop. Maynard (Duane Whitaker, one of the racist cops in Tales From the Hood), the owner, ends up taking both by gunpoint and ties them up in a room where his partner Zed (Peter Greene, who was in The Mask) takes Marcellus from behind while the gimp (Stephen Hibbert, who was married to Julia Sweeney at the time, who also shows up briefly as the daughter of Monster Joe; Joe was going to be played by Dick Miller, but that scene was cut) watches over Butch.Butch overpowers the man in the bondage suit and decided to go back and save his enemy, using a sword to kill Maynard while Marcellus grabs a shotgun and shoots Zed, wounding him just enough so that he can call some of his worst men to get revenge. They agree that Butch can leave, but can never come back to Los Angeles. He grabs Zed's bike, gets his girl - who really has caused so much of this mess because she acts like a child - and gets out of town.Why does Butch save the man who made his life hell? Because in Tarantino's mashup universe, protagonists live in the symbolic universe of the Japanese samurai, where honor is more important than anything. Leaving Marcellus to have his manhood further destroyed and then killed isn't the death that a warrior deserves. It's no accident that of the weapons offered, which also include a hammer, a chainsaw and a bat, he takes the sword.Back in time, as they get the briefcase, Jules and Vincent surviving an attack at Brett's apartment when a man somehow misses them every single time. They argue over whether this was a miracle or not, which leads to Vincent accidentally shooting Marvin (Phil LaMarr, the voice of Green Lantern John Stewart on the Justice League cartoons). They decide to visit Jules' friend Jimmie (Tarantino), who is stressed about his wife coming home from work. That means that the cleaner, Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), must come and do his work by disposing of the evidence.That issue dealt with, the dup come back to the diner at the beginning of the film. Jules decides that he's going to retire and walk the earth like Kane from Kung Fu, which Vincent finds ridiculous. As he goes to the bathroom, the couple we met earlier start to rob the place. Vincent returns and this leads to a Mexican standoff, but Jules successfully uses his newfound love of peace to diffuse the situation and everyone leaves alive.The Bible passage that Jules quotes isn't exactly from the Good Book. It's more paraphrased and also harkens back to the lessons that Sonny Chiba would deliver before vanquishing evil in his films.Pulp Fiction got its start as a trilogy that would be written by Avery and Tarantino, but would also have a third director. It was inspired by Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which is another portmanteau film. Tarantino's original story, Black Mask, ended up becoming Reservoir Dogs. Avery's story Pandemonium Reigns is the gold watch story within this film.There's no score to the film, but instead a pastiche of near underground American music. There's a ton of surf rock in this film, as Tarantino felt that it sounded like the themes of Italian spaghetti westerns.This is also the beginning of the incredibly self-referential universe of Tarantino films. Vincent Vega and Mr. Blonde being brothers, Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna burgers show up in many of his films and Mia Wallace's TV pilot Fox Force Five is either a tease for Kill Bill or places that film as a fictionalized part of an overall narrative. For kids that grew up reading comic books or loving when TV shows crossed over, this would become an entirely new obsession. Throw in the fact that this movie references every movie that came before it and you get the reason why we're devoting an entire week to these films.Pulp Fiction is 25 years old this year. It doesn't feel that way. It achieves that rarest of movie dreams - utter timelessness."
27 March 2021,corythejoker,4,4,10,Pulp fiction,My opinion this is my all time favorite movie. Tarantino is also my all time favorite director. 1994 was a year with many masterpieces probably my favorite year for film. Pulp fiction is riveting well acted and in my opinion nothing against Forrest Gump or Shawshank Redemption which were also fantastic that were nominated for best picture in 1994. This is my citizen Kane over citizen Kane. This story about 2 hitmen there boss his wife and a boxer on what happens in 2 days is a tour de force to be seen and is the greatest 90s film and the greatest film of all time in my opinion.
28 May 2019,zanghi_james,5,7,10,A Perfect follow-up to Reservoir Dogs!,"Quentin Tarantino made a nice splash with his cinematic debut of directing Reservoir Dogs. And less than five years later, he followed up with another wonderful non-linear masterpiece that not only lived up to the previous films performance, but outshined it as well, appropriately called Pulp Fiction.Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction is not for everyone. There is an incredible amount of cussing and swearing as well as violence and disturbing imagery. There are some callbacks to the style of Reservoir Dogs as well with the violence, like not showing the violent boxing match that is the main point of Bruce Willis' character's story in the film is definitely a callback to Tarantino not showing the botched diamond robbery in Reservoir Dogs. Some of the scenes of violence are so out there, though, that they are almost like R-Rated scenes from a Three Stooges short, most notably the scene where Uma Thurman needs to be revived from overdosing on Heroin. However, don't expect such comedical style all the time, since there is that one scene with Bruce and Ving that is like Deliverance was directed by Eli Roth.As usual, the casting choices of the film are spot-on. Ving Rhames, who I really only have seen else in the Mission Impossible films, plays a great, tough, and much more likable gangster than Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs. John Travolta's character, despite doing a great dance scene, plays a pretty despicable bonehead who gets his comeuppance in a nice satisfying way of gallows humor. The true star is Samuel L. Jackson, playing a good-natured and loyal gangster who, following a slightly botched job, gets a better view of his violent life and decides to get his act together. The cameos are, as usual, really cool, also. Bruce Willis plays an okay tough guy in this one also, though his tantrum when he loses his watch is a little out of control. I mean, I agree that the watch is critically important to his character, but he didn't have to blow up at his girlfriend like that...And of course, the soundtrack rocks."
30 March 2020,e-67102-48412,2,2,10,Beloved in black humor.,"The bodyguards who read the Bible before shooting, the boxers who killed people with samurai swords, the homosexuals who raised slaves, the elegant old butlers. When all the cool elements were complete, the director used them to talk about a lot of trials. It is also a thrilling story. It makes people applaud.Ingenious structure, wonderful lines, and the mapping of the circular structure to reality, Quentin is really a genius , playing so much in a movie, and can also produce a unique style of violence ."
3 June 2010,gigan-92,10,19,10,One of My Top 15!!,"Grade: A +Is it a redemption story? If so, of human nature, or the characters themselves? A simple buddy film where action and comedy is spliced together? HELL NO!! This film has a left mark ever since I saw it. It was so different, so humorous, and yet so moving. All of this in one genre that is in itself truly hard to define.Tarantino has truly written a masterpiece. This film in reality tells three stories, which one such as myself, upon first viewing, found confusing. What can I say; it was my first Tarantino film! But after watching it several times, as I have also done, it really starts to hit you. Simply said, it really is a redemption story. Our characters are hit men, drug dealers and proud users and crime bosses. They make a living off killing and sin. So, in essence they are the ""bad guys"". And yet the audience is drawn to them due to the comedy they use. The dialogue is so rich and original we get to see two hit men talk freely about foot massages right before busting a mission, and yet it isn't regarded as silly. What other film can do that; none!In fact, it is these moments that give ""Pulp Fiction"" that flame. Perhaps the best example of this savior of the human soul theme is Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules. His performance is probably the most vivid in the movie. Every line he utters is a testament to what Tarantino envisioned. The human soul is a vile corrupt thing, but it can be reformed. It can be saved. But one has to be willing to make that change. Many times it takes a miracle for us to realize that and to make a change. It can even be our destiny to save the souls of others, as the final scene depicts with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). There are cruel consequences that fate can play against those who refuse their destiny, as the tragic case with Vincent's death.The cast is spectacular. John Travolta and Uma Thurman (Mia) have a genius yet troubled 'love-story', twisted with temptation. Christopher Walken appears as Captain Koons and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace. My favorite actor besides Samuel L. Jackson has got to be Harvey Keitel, who is known only as the Wolf. Every actor brings a different emotion to the film, really spicing it up and making it a varied film.One of my personal Top 15 films ever, ""Pulp Fiction"" is widely entertain and will invoke the curiosity of movie goers for years to come."
7 January 2021,gedikreverdi,5,8,8,Simply exquisite.,"Vincent had to take the wife of the boss out and do whatever she'd want. They went to dine out and won the trophy for the dancing competition. Back home she tried the coke Vincent just got and overdosed. Vincent drove to the dealer house and he had to inject the adrenaline shot into her chest and she woke up and they came back and promised it'd be their secret. Butch the boxer cheated the boss and killed his opponent at the match and went to his girlfriend fabienne with an exotic Colombian cab driver. They had fun and in the morning he had to get back to their flat before escaping because fabienne forgot his fathers watch. At their flat he just saw a gun with a silencer in the kitchen and Vincent came out of the bathroom and he shot him dead and left. On his way back to the motel he saw the boss by the lights and hit him and had an accident. Butch took a refuge in a guitar shop and the boss came after and the owner dominated them and called a friend over and they turned out to be some sick guys into bondage and rape. One of them raped the boss while their slave was watching butch. Butch untied himself and knocked the slave out and wanted to run away but turned back and killed one of the guys with a sword and the boss shot the rapist in the crotch and would call people over to torture him to death. He also wanted butch to leave town that day and they're fine. With the chopper in front of the store he got back to fabienne and they left the motel. It was even better than what I expected it to be. When they killed the young men who stole from their boss Vincent and Jules killed the guy that tried to kill them but failed miserably and Jules thought it was divine intervention. They spare the black guys life and took him with them. Vincent accidentally shot the guy in the face and stained the car. They went over to jimmys house (Tarantino) and their boss sent Winston to help them out. They cleaned the car, they were washed naked and wore jimmys tshirts and shorts. At the coffee shop the couple wanted to rob the restaurant while they were having breakfast and Vincent was at the bathroom. Jules wanted to quit the job because he felt gods touch when they miraculously missed the bullets of the giant pistol. Jules said he tries hard to be the shepherd and repeated the quotation from the Bible confessing he's no idea what it's about. He didn't killed them and let them leave with the customer wallets and his money except for his wallet. I can't tell how almost 3 hours passed. I will definitely watch it again"
22 March 2021,yourworsrnighfmare,3,3,10,Pulp Fiction- Endless Fun Of A Film,"Pulp Fiction is really good. It really is a Tarantino film and you can tell. I didn't know who directed it, but 5 minutes in I knew automatically it was Tarantino's craziness. It couldn't be done any tighter way, but I love that about it. Tarantino wanted us to make up what was in the briefcase, and I'm gonna say it's a Gold Dildo. It could make sense because everyone is just in shock of what it is and many ask, ""Is that what I think it is?"" If you want to watch something on HBO Max that is really good, watch Pulp Fiction. 10/19, Fun and I highly recommend this."
2 September 2019,aarongnr,6,10,8,Not as good as I thought it would be at the middle of the movie...,"While watching, I was about half into the movie, I thought: Ok, now I get why everyone loves this movie so much. It's funny and the situations are so absurdly entertaining. I kept thinking: Damn, I am so excited for that ending, which brings everything together and makes sense of it all.But it doesn't come. We just get a timejump to inbetween the story, showing us how to get away with murder and that continues the robbery from the start, this time with full context. But to what result? None. It has no influence on the movie whatsoever. And it wasn't the most interesting scene aswell.
One could argue that, had it not been for that ""miracle"" moment that we see in the flashback, and Jackson's characters decision to retire from the job, they would've both been in the boxers appartment, which means that the boxer would've died, and many of the other stuff would not have happened. And that IS pretty genius and really cool.Then again, there is stuff that was cool to watch, but that had really no influence on the movie as far as I can see. The whole sequence with Travolta and Thurman for example. It was fun to watch, because of Tarantinos awesome style for dialogue and stuff, but it didn't really add to the overall story.One could argue, that this movie is plotless, but I wouldn't go that far.It is very original and genius in some aspects, in others not as much as I would've liked.Cheers"
17 December 2004,Q-Man,36,80,2,I guess I just don't get it,"I think that there is a herd mentality about this film. Because Tarantino cultists liked it, people say things like ""the best film of the 90's"". People seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved Pulp Fiction. Maybe I just don't get it, but what is so great about it? It's circular, big deal. The entire film is pointless, and I really don't care about any of the characters. The violence is gratuitous. I am not squeamish. I have watched, and, I have to admit, enjoyed Romero's ""dead"" films. It is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car. Yep, that is hilarious. The only good thing about the film is that John Travolta is in it."
19 April 2020,zeekwunlau,6,10,9,"You and I are passers-by, lonely and boring soul","The narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. Hold the audience's attention very well. Each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. From beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. It can be said that Quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height.In fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. Ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. Elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. So to take this bragging, I think it is insulting Quentin's level.When I watch this movie, I see Quentin's understanding of the characters. Gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. These things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. The first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. In fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. No bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just.So the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. Dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. So Quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. All dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. All these conversations endow the characters with soul. It so happens that they are all interesting souls. In the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. So, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. And the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. But after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. After all, there are few normal people. It can be said that they are all weird characters. The weird director made great works again.In the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. We eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. The most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. In particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more I want to know what will happen next.Of course, this is just the appeal of the story. The story comes from the script, so I say the script of this movie is great. Quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. Only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work.In short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary.Like a lonely ant, peeping into the sparrow's eyes."

10 January 2006,hhfarm-1,27,60,4,Pretty at times but mostly superficial and devious,"This is worth seeing 1-2 times as it was fresh and innovative when it came out 10+ years ago. Tarantino certainly can write terrific dialogue. Walken, Roth and a couple of others are good. There are some beautiful scenes eg. the dance contest.By the time he got to Pulp Fiction, Tarantino had become self-conscious and, more important, had fooled himself into thinking that he had something deep to convey.Pulp Fiction is all hip and clever and fast and cool. It - any Tarantino movie really - laughs at movie conventions, characters, plots, story lines, scenes, and acting itself. In this he's following Burt Reynolds, who parodied his own roles and laughed at his own movies until he himself became a joke.When you watch Pulp Fiction you either buy into it or you don't. If you buy in, it's probably awesome (or at least better than the Kill Bill cr*p). But if you stand back a little bit it's just Hollywood behind an ultra-hip mask and like TV: slick & glossy but paper thin.After hearing much about this, we saw it not long after it came out. Easily the biggest disappointment ever in actual:hype ratio. This movie should rate 6/10 but is downgraded because of raised expectations.In complaining about it, a friend explained that to truly appreciate Pulp Fiction you had to understand that the briefcase contained Marsellus Wallace's soul, and that Jackson was an angel, and various other important insights.That's it then: as with any great movie, it just needed to be explained."
7 August 2001,raymond_chandler,61,150,3,"Redemption? Spirituality? Yeah, Right.","The comments for ""Pulp Fiction"" generally fall into one of three categories: 1) ""Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!"" raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.
I had read about ""Reservoir Dogs"" (but not seen it) when ""Pulp"" was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Seven"" are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of ""Pulp"". I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that ""Pulp Fiction"" has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (""Rashomon""), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (""Scarface"", for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk."
26 May 2011,ScottAmundsen,25,58,1,Is Tarantino Our New Kubrick?,"It seems to be the fashion among film ""intelligentsia"" to give wild praise to the most incomprehensible and incoherent rubbish, sending the partly unspoken message that if you, the film-goer, do not get it, you are not smart enough to understand it. This applies to most of the oeuvre of the late Stanley Kubrick (with the exception of LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and to a point A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), and it applies equally well to this odd and trashy bit of nonsense handed to us by Quentin Tarantino. To say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement, but if that isn't bad enough, it is also incoherent and confusing (at one point the Samuel L Jackson character dies, if memory serves, only to show up alive later with no explanation given). Uma Thurman is striking to look at in that dark wig, and Travolta stretches what little acting talent he has, but I still to this day have no idea what the movie was about, and frankly, Tarantino failed to make me care very much.Like most of Kubrick's work, this film is visually striking: the color palette in particular is stunning. But at the end of the day, how a film looks means nothing unless there is some substance underneath the surface, and if there is any here, I did not see it.At the time this movie came out, the critics were falling all over themselves proclaiming that it represented a new direction for Hollywood films. Fortunately that seems not to have been the case."
9 April 2002,KubricksRube,153,376,1,One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers),"Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself ""I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here"".  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off."
5 May 2017,McFrogg,32,78,1,Putrefaction,"For some strange reason, Pulp Fiction is regarded as a masterpiece, and its director a genius. According to some ancient legends, the movie is supposedly so awesome that most of its fans lose the ability to tell us exactly why it is so darn good.One of my friends used to talk about how great Pulp Fiction was after he saw it with his stoner dad. I had of course heard positive stuff about it before, and decided to be polite and watch it when he showed up at my apartment with the DVD. We turned it off after maybe seven hours or so. Some people will say: ""but you didn't watch the last 20 minutes!!! It's the ending that is good!"". I'm sorry, but I don't have to go outside and eat dog crap to know it's bad for me.I really can't understand what's so great about it. When people talk about this piece of crap, they usually bring up the ""distoibing"" gimp scene, the fat Travolta dance or the part where the hit men accidentally blow the black guy's head off. Clap...clap...? My friend didn't even say why he liked it. He just had a blank look on his face and repeated: ""bring out the gimp, bring out the gimp"" over and over again. Okay, so the last part didn't really happen, but I bet he only liked it because his father told him it was good. But why did his father like it? Drugs? I think many people brainwash themselves into liking Tarantino movies. ""It's Tarantino, therefore it's good! It's Tarantino, therefore it's good!"" Had Tarantino made Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards under a pseudonym, people would just laugh and say ""what kind of Uwe Boll garbage is this?""."
18 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,6,12,9,Worth the hype,"Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this.I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either.The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes.There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space.While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of ""gangster stuff"" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come."
3 June 2019,VS132,5,7,10,"""Did I Break Your Concentration?""","Where do I even begin? Even after twenty-five years, Pulp Fiction still remains my favorite movie of all-time. Why? Because it takes the all the aspects of what makes an excellent film in my opinion. The characters are all so interesting from the smooth hit-man Vincent, the voluptuous Mia Wallace, the intense boxer Butch, the mysterious Marsellus Wallace, the criminals Honey Bunny & Pumpkin; and the greatest performance for any character; Samuel L. Jackson as the interrogate hit-man, Jules Winfield. All of the actors shined because of the fantastic screenplay Quentin Tarantino wrote to make these colorful cast of characters come to life by their dialogue that makes you glued to the screen even if what is presented ties to the non-linear narrative or not. This is best shown nearing the end when it is shown that neither Jules or Vincent are good men by any means because they go to people's houses, interrogate, and kill them without cause; but that doesn't mean that they have heart as through their hit-men skills, were able to stop two criminals from robbing a diner. That's ingenious writing as Tarantino knows that society are full of people who aren't heroes or antagonists; there is a division and altercation within cinema and reality. Coupled with throwbacks to classic films, and an unforgettable soundtrack, Pulp Fiction will remain to impress audiences and one that I and many others; will continue to enjoy for years to come. It has such a high re-watch value despite its length!"
25 August 2002,jbirtel,6,10,10,A Rosebud for the 90's,"It must tickle Tarantino to no end to read or listen to all the self-proclaimed 'experts' who dissect and analyze every scene, shot and line; and apply their religious or mythic interpretations; then proceed to pat themselves on the back for their ingenuity. Yes...this movie is chock-full of subtexts and inside references (and plenty of homages to movies past), but the bottom line is: it's not so much original as it is combining so many elements of comedy sketches and classic Story chestnuts wrapped in some great soundtracks. And the results explode like a blast of fresh air. So just sit back and enjoy the ride!Not that there is anything new to his approach. 'Citizen Kane' (non-linear story) and 'American Graffiti' (scenes written to fit an existing soundtrack) and even 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein' (The comedy/horror movie) are just a few examples of popular re-inventions. But Tarantino's approach are more like reminders of combining many more elements of great movies (or great movie scenes) and making those reminders seem like re-inventions. Is there anything wrong with that? Not a chance! Not when the end film has so much wit, intelligence and energy. It's time for guilty pleasure!Every actor (to the small bit parts) is perfectly cast, to single one performance over another would be an unjust slight. This is not a competition of who comes off best, this is a massive group of a labor of love everyone involved must have relished (including the technicians) so that the story comes first and everyone has their chance to shine when it serves the story to do so. The direction, camera angles and editing causes the movie to unfold much like a book, which may qualify it as being a visual 'page-turner'; you can't wait to see what happens next. And just when you think the movie is going to turn right; BAM! off it goes again on another left turn. This was one of the first movies I'd had seen in a long time that I wasn't able to predict on what was going to happen next (with so many movie cliches where the hero gets violent revenge 'At The End', the hero's side-kick is killed off two-thirds of the way thru, the damsel in distress stupidly allows herself to being captured, dialogue that is 'dumbed-down' to appeal to the (so called) mass).To get the most from this entertainment, it's best to know nothing about it other than the info on the DVD jacket. To reveal ANYTHING is to rob yourself of a great movie viewing (and listening) experience. So...you won't find any lazy re-hashing of the plot in this review.The ""Collector's Edition""('s) DTS sound is fantastic and is a huge improvement over the 5.1 Dolby Digital's earlier DVD release. If you love the movie, then you'll enjoy the wealth of bonus material.(Very subtle spoiler) Alright! I'll indulge just this once, concerning the contents of the briefcase. I don't buy the voodoo religious suggestion that the case contains the soul of Marcellous Wallace in spite of the 666 or the band-aid on the back of his neck (a happy accident for interpretation because actor Ving Rhames had a scar that needed covering). I've heard gold bricks; an Oscar; even the holy grail. I think Tarantino just put a gold glow there to create massive theories and arguments (brilliant ploy). BUT, if I had to pick: taking into account the director's love of movies, the characters' reaction and subsequent action to steal it (including Brett & party; especially Pumpkin's reaction: ""Is that what I think it is??"" which Jules confirms) I wouldn't mind thinking that the contents refers to the 1941 classic directed by John Huston that begins the story in 1539 of ""a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with the rarest of jewels"" and how history showed what little regard some people placed on the value of human life to gain its possession. NOW...everything fits into place! But, that's only if I HAD to pick.10 out of 10! Probably the movie of the decade."

Jackson,John Travolta,Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all simply amazing in this!. The dialog is extremely intelligent and witty, and I thought the whole foot massage story was really funny, plus The opening and ending are both especially awesome. I believe this film deserves to be #9 on the top 250! and my favorite segment has to be the watch with Butch Coolidge (Willis), plus Jackson and Travolta were so awesome together and had brilliant chemistry!. The music is fantastic, and Mia's (Thurman) OD'ing scene is both disturbing and somewhat funny at the same time, plus I thought the character development was outstanding. Ving Rhames is ultra cool in his role, and this is extremely well made and written as well! plus the scene where Mia and Vincent Vega are at the diner is just fascinating!.I remember watching this when I was about 13 or 14, and thinking it was so boring, god how could I have been so stupid!, this is truly what brilliant filmaking is all about, plus all the characters are extremely likable. I personally thought Quentin Tarantino was great in his scene and it is quite violent at times, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off in the car, as I found that to be a great bit of dark humor in my opinion. Harevy Keitel's scene is a memorable one was The Wolfe, and Uma's ketchup joke was funny, plus it all feels like a Dark comedy to me!. Travolta's joke about how they call the quarter pounder with cheese in Paris was very funny and Samuel L. Jackson had some brilliant lines as well! plus I loved Eric Stolt'z character as well. This is Tarantino's absolute best work, and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? do so immediately you won't regret it trust me!.The Direction is masterful. Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is incredible!. Samuel L. Jackson is amazing here, he gives quite possibly his best performance, is hilarious, had brilliant chemistry with John Travolta, had some of the coolest lines of all time, really seemed to be enjoying himself, and just gave one of a kind performance, he was amazing (Jackson Rules!!!!). John Travolta is just as good, he rejuvenated his career, with his role here, and rightfully so. his scene with Uma Thurman in the diner, was especially awesome, he also looked damn cool. (Travolta Rules!!!!). Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he played one of his coolest characters, and it was basically an action role, but damn was it a good one!,Butch was my favorite character along with Jules!, he was just perfect for Butch (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Uma Thurman also gives one of her best performances here, as the drug addicted Mia, she didn't have all that much screen time, but she made it memorable!(Thurman Rules!!!!!). Ving Rhames is excellent here as Marcellus, he was just a bad ass, and had a very cool scene with Willis!. Eric Stoltz cracked me up as Lance, he was one of the funniest characters in the film in my opinion. Christopher Walken had a cool cameo here and was great. Quentin Tarantino is actually really good as Jimmy and was quite funny. Harvey Keitel is awesome as the Wolfe as he cracked me up I loved him. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are both awesome as the robbers, and were just great. Rosanna Arquette(Jody) did what she had to do well. Rest of the cast do fine.

8 December 2015,DigitalShark1,7,11,9,A Master achievement in filmmaking,"This film is a masterpiece in filmmaking. The Idea of taking one event and watching it from three different perspective is a genius idea on it's own, but this movie takes it a step forward by adding amazing characters and incredible dialogue. This film is a masterpiece. Some people complain about the violence, but I think that's actually a huge strength. The film isn't scared to show some blood and it represents how horrifying some of the scenarios are. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson do amazing performances as the Hit-men. Tim Roth from Reservoir Dogs is back and performs a killer performance in this film too, and of course Bruce Willis is Fantastic as he is in most of his movies. Expect for Die Hard 5, but that's another story.All in all, This film really knows how to be original is not telling a three act structure story and instead telling a very clever idea and a very clever story. But what else do you expect from one of the greatest directors of all-time, Quentin Tarantino?9.75/10"

                        ",blood and f****** spirituality,"I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same."
29 June 2009,ryanaustinf,8,13,9,An example of a cinematic masterpiece.,"HOLY CRAP! In my whole life I have never seen a film this good. Two hours and thirty minutes just flew by and I didn't even notice it's been an hour when the first part was over. This film left me in awe and I feel like watching it again and again and again. People say this is overrated; well it sort of deserves it! So this is all opinion and the only fact is an event in the movie. -------------------SPOILER LINE---------------- So our main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). These characters are two of the best in the whole history of film and they deserved the Oscars they got. Our villain is umm... Since there's no exact villain, this film gets the bonus. Our supporting characters are Butch (BRUCE WILLIS!), Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), Pumpkin(Tim Roth), and Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). All these characters play into the film perfectly. The genre of the film is crime, black comedy, and thriller. Well there was crime, at parts I was laughing my ass off, and some parts, my heart was beating so fast. There were no boring moments in this film. The story is told out of order. We start in a Diner and end in a Diner. So I'll summarize the story in its real order. Vincent and Jules get a case containing ....... and then they accidentally kill someone in their car so they have to clean it out. Jules thinks about retiring while the diner they're eating at is held up. Jules stops the robbery and go to a bar where Vincent gets his assignment from Marcellus Wallace. He takes Mia Wallace out. She gets overdosed in drugs. And the rest is spoiling the story. So, I give Pulp Fiction, one of THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, 95% AWESOME! The highest rating so far!"
30 October 2013,coljam21,7,13,10,So Cool.,"I watched this movie once in my early 20's and totally didn't get it. I watched it again in my 30's and was blown away! This movie is freakin awesome. Quentin Tarantino found a way to wrap the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's into this film seamlessly and beautifully. Just an awesome movie with a great script and unexpected humor throughout. The movie is cool and it makes you want to be cool too. One thing I have noticed about Tarantino is that his movies are very cool. They make you feel like you're back in the 70's when it was OK to smoke cool. They make you feel like wearing sunglasses in doors cool.The cast was awesome. Every cast member played their role beautifully. Samuel Jackson was awesome! It was so hilarious how he ate that guy's cheese burger then drank his entire drink in the beginning of the movie before shooting him. That scene was just epic. Every scene was epic."
5 May 2008,freemantle_uk,4,7,10,Tarantino's Best and a Favourite of mine,"Pulp Fiction is great movie, Quentin Tarantino's best. It is multi-layered, having a number of stories involved in the movie. The stories involved in the movie include Vincent (John Travola) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) going out on a hit and accidentally killing a man in their car and thereby having to sort of the mess, Vincent having to entertain Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), taking her to a 50s themed restaurant and ends up taking a heroin overdose and Vincent having to save her life, Butch (Bruce Willis) crossing paths with gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and end up having to work together and a robbery of a restaurant by a couple which happens at the beginning and the end of the film.Pulp Fiction has many of the traits that make Tarantino such a good writer/director: there great dialogue and humour, there is a number of stories and Tarantino never tells a story straight (this was done in Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Kill Bill), good casting, violence and a great soundtrack. Tarantino was also not scare to look at some dark plots such as male rape and the underbelly of crime. Because of Pulp Fiction Travola's career got a kickstart (a Simpsons' joke at the time was that Travola was working a 70's themed bar), made Samuel L. Jackson a household name and got him an Oscar and help made the careers of Uma Thurman and Rhames. Because of the way the story is set out Pulp Fiction needs to be watched a number of times, which in my mind normally a good thing because it makes you think and pay attention. It also has good lines in the film, such as the Royale with Cheese conversation and good moments of comedy and dark humour. A moment I really like is when Marsellus Wallace sees Butch in a car whilst he was crossing the road. As well because of the film I have the Fun Loving Criminals' song from the film on my iPod, with the beginning of the film as well."
25 June 2010,khanbaliq2,6,12,10,"Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American film of the 1990s.","Brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime film of all time. Interlocking stories from the seedy side of Los Angeles include ruthless hit men, a gangster's beautiful wife with a roaming eye and a boxer who refuses to take all.Pulp Fiction is the defining film of the 1990s, playfully mixing up its chronology, packed with memorable, snappy, cute dialogue and showing a genuine zest for the art of film-making. Director Quentin Tarantino's film-literacy, learned obsessively during his stint as a video-store assistant, pays off handsomely here; almost every line is quotable, a sense of fun pervades, there's a host of delightful set-pieces (including John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's sexy dance) and generous screen time is given to characters rarely considered at length in film, such as Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's stolid hit men. Briefly, Tarantino shone brighter than anyone else in the industry, and this film justifies his accolades."
9 July 2009,Cristi_Ciopron,5,10,8,Very amusing thriller,"Do not, my fair reader, be put off by the countless jerks who already affiliated themselves to the PULP FICTION cult, and this not because there's yet some room for still more jerks to join the cult but because there is much more in PULP FICTION than what meets the mimetic jerks' eyes. On KANE there's a crust of _academism and bores' gossip, on PF there's a crust of nastiness and jerks' ineptitude. And for one thing, daddy Tarantino is a true director—the way a Lynch or the Coens are not. Now admit it, fair, lovable reader—what if PF were no more famous than Omar the Tentmaker, Old Ironsides, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, The Princess from Hoboken or The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini? Now wouldn't you cry masterpiece and claim that Tarantino is an ignored genius? I call this the GONE WITH THE WIND test—take a movie that you think is overrated and then pretend or imagine it's unknown—what would you feel? The false thesis is that it could serve as a substitute for the '70s trash classics; it will not. It's not an updating or upgrading of the '70s cult flicks.It's a treat, it's straight wonderful; the performances are gold, the script is indeed fine. It has zest, gusto, true storytelling, some awesome action and some nasty violence—and an enjoyable score.What if PULP FICTION were as famous as Isle of the Snake People or The Utah Kid? Liking this movie does not mean binding to the fashion—but acknowledging the obvious—and I do so joyfully—you can also see it as a Willis movie, that's what I did, consider PULP FICTION as primarily a Willis movie, one of Willis' most distinguished roles."
22 November 2013,alishahmohd,4,6,10,An unique and extremely entertaining film.,"For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example: Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall: 9.5/10"
16 July 2020,aryansinghindo,6,8,10,A cinematic masterpiece,"Way better than the other films of Tarantino. A cinematic that will be studied for centuries to come. It is bold,sexy,unique,dialogue driven and mesmerizing. A masterfully crafted film where loose ends are tide beautifully which is one of the most innovative things and Tarantino masters the storytelling.
The dialogues are excellent, I loved those moments when they talked about Royale with cheese,divine intervention,pigs,tony rocky horror and others.
A perfect blend of crime and comedy which makes it a cornerstone of cinema and is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and definitely Tarantino's masterpiece and my favourite movie ever.
I laughed out loud when Marvin was shot in the face.😂
Those who are giving negative reviews are light hearted,stupid and have no idea about cinema.
This is not glorifying racism and homophobia, it presents a dark reality perfectly embedded with lots and lots of humour.
Travolta,Jackson, Uma and Bruce Willis were outstanding.
Don't miss this insane masterpiece."

                        ","Good Tarantino Flick About Gangsters, But Not Great.","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies I liked more in retrospect than at the time. I think Tarantino's genius does play a part in this film, and the product is substantial; but Reservoir Dogs is better.All the characters use witty, random dialogue about European hamburgers and the sexual implications of foot massages, but to what avail? I mean, as fun as it is to hear and watch, I just found that the whole movie lacked something. Maybe a little bit more editing would've done the trick; maybe it was something else. I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong. I think this is a classic Tarantino movie. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's quotable lines, as well as a couple of outstanding scenes. (The OD, the Big Date, the scene where Harvey Keitel gets rid of the body, etc.) As a whole, the movie does work. But some minor details would make it even better.The storyline of Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames was a little much. (Did Ving *really* have to get raped?) I know Tarantino just wanted to add some shock value to his film, but even for a person who doesn't mind that kind of thing in movies I found it a little extreme.Oh, and one more thing: I learned that ""zapateria"" means ""shoe store"" in Spanish, courtesy of Butch. ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 8/10HandHStudios"
23 March 2005,cyberknight,21,54,1,"Another ""Yucky"" Tarantino","In one word: boring.Get the comments people make about this movie. You have those that say it's ""innovative and controversial"", others that it's ""violent and refreshing"", others that say it's a ""rebellious masterpiece"". Yes, you can check it out, absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments. Why? I have a theory: those guys have NEVER watched a good movie. And I mean it! Violence? Gosh, this movie was only less boring than ""Natural Born Killers"", the worst movie ever made (don't worry, I have a ""good"" comment prepared for that crap, also).There is only one really violent scene in the whole movie, when the pervert binds the boxer Bruce (and the other guy I can't even remember who was) and prepares to torture them. I can't remember if he actually does torture them, but that's absolutely irrelevant, the situation the characters are put into is what really matter. And Bruce choosing the sword when he escapes, oh my, that was really nice (the only good moment in the whole movie). Wanna see lots of fake blood, watch ""Happy Tree Friends""! But do you want true violence, watch ""Spoorloos"". Paraphrasing it, if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do, you haven't seen anything yet!It's absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our ""civilization"". Okay, a murder is terrible, but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive (not only the victims, but also those around them...)""Pulp Fiction"" is about terminating people without a good reason, nothing more. I see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless character's head (MTv's Movie Awards parody of the car scene was excellent, they really got the idea!!!) This movie only shows more fake blood than most ""hollywoodian"" movies, but what's the point? If it created a revolution in Cinema, it was to make it ""yuckier""... I have seen much more blood in ""Hellraiser"", which, by the way, has blood AND violence! All Tarantino's movies are too shallow to show true violence...Too bad IMDb doesn't allow voting zero for a movie..."
13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,4,7,10,"""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration?""","There's just something about Pulp Fiction that makes it great. It took me a while to figure it out, but I think I found it. This may sound weird, but I think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. What is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer/Director/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and ""save"" someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra ""character"" in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of ""Miserlou,"" which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play ""Jungle Boogie"" in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing ""Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon"" while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after ""Son of a Preacher Man"" welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s."
17 April 2010,jonnyfendi,4,7,10,"If You Like Independent Movie, Totally You Must See Thiz Movie!","Thiz movie is known as the most talked about movie of the decade. The movie receives a lot of good reviews from most critics. You must see it yourself then you will understand why. ""Pulp Fiction"" is starred by many famous Actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and many more. It's directed by Quentin Tarantino who is known for his eccentric works. The plot is unusual, but very intriguing in a strange way. The script made by Tarantino himself. It's kind of confusing in the beginning, but it becomes better and better as time goes by. It moves forward and backward along the movie with attractive flashback sequences. The thing that made thiz movie so special is simply those elements. You must see it over and over to understand the idea. However, actually the plot is just an ordinary plot, but the editing made it extremely extraordinary for overall. The other factor that make thiz movie unforgettable is the dialogue. The dialogue is mostly long but colorful, rude but exciting. Thiz movie is actually made with limited budget, but it's still loaded with many big stars. Thiz has proved that the Actors know for sure there is something very special in the script. The other memorable scene that you will never forget is when the dancing scene of John Travolta and Uma Truman. The dancing is phenomenal. Most people remember Travolta for his 1980s musical movies such as ""Saturday Night Fever"" (1977) and ""Grease"" (1978). Today, when we see him dancing again with his present figure, you can feel in that very moment, something magical is happening. That is the fun part. If you like indie movie, you certainly must go to see thiz one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
4 December 2015,harveybdickens,7,11,9,Quentin Tarantino's best movie,"Quentin Tarantino's movies are there own genre. 25 years ago however, he was a nobody. Then he directed THIS movie, and this is what put him on the map, as one of the directors to look out for.Pulp Fiction is about a number of different characters, whose stories all intertwine together during the course of this movie. You've got the two hit men Jules Winnfield, and Vincent Vega. You've got Butch Coolidge, a boxer, whose losing his game, so to speak. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, two robbers, who appear at the start, and the end of the movie, although they technically only appear in one stage of the movie.That's one of the interesting things about this movie. It is not told in chronological order. One might think this would confuse the story, but it actually makes it more interesting.This adds to an already interesting story, but the driving force behind the movie is the dialogue. A lot of dialogue based movies can be boring, and this one is boring very occasionally. This certainly is one of the more interesting dialogue based, that keeps people interested for its 2.5 hour length. For this reason it is possibly one of the most quotable movies of all time.Considering that, and how well it is made, it is obvious, due to the content, that this movie isn't for everybody. Some people really won't like it. However anyone who likes great dialogue, will probably like it, cinema nerds (like myself) will probably like it, I certainly enjoyed most of it, and so I give it 8/10"
29 February 2008,stallone-9,6,11,10,Quentin you're the man!!!,"This is a pure masterpiece folks.Actually a unique movie with its own style and feel unlike anything before it.You have to see it for yourself and find out what the film is all about because everybody has different interpretation of it.The essence of the 50s,60s and 70s captured and combined in one big hell of a movie.Highest admirations to all the actors who were involved in this movie.John Travolta is my number one character in the film fallowed closely by Sam Jackson,Bruce Willis and the hotter than ever Uma Thurman.The dialog is great and you feel like you're in the movie yourself connected with these people.Guns,blood,torture,rapes(and you'll never guess who got raped)and a briefcase full of whatever your imagination is.What Pulp Fiction right away-one of the definitive movies of the 90s and one of the best of all times."
3 January 2021,omarhaloul-44489,8,11,9,Tarantino threw a masterpiece upon us,"Pulp fiction the movie I started hating and yet it came to be one of my favorite movies, I completely loved the originality of the film and the gorgeous dialogue the main theme the film articulates is chance and the random nature of life and how our decisions are conformed accordingly. the mantle of the film is for sure the dialogue which fleshes out the main theme and drives it forward. the best performance for sure goes for Samuel L Jackson and got the best character arc ,too. the dialogue is subtly written keeping you immersed in the film, it crafts the perspectives of the characters and their approach to life and how seriously they take the definition of redemption.
the narrative of the film is upside down , scattered and randomly told emphasizing the chaotic nature of life , and the unpredictable situation we may encounter, and the impact of these random situations on our perception and pursuing reconsideration when the opportunity is offered.
the movie doesn't attempt to avoid luck but it depends on it that is precisely the thread which make the plot tight.
the movie demonstrates the theme by dividing the story into four characters
and putting them in what is supposed to be a turning point of their lives. obviously the movie raises imperative questions we arguably could relate to, could really a singular moment be sufficiently enough to persuade you to reconsider your choices? is it really random and we don't get to choose the coarse of our lives or this is just a justification? each character faced these questions differently, Mia Wallace was almost dead by overdose but she was saved by luck so she was offered a chance to redeem her spoiled life, Butch when he decided to save Wallace instead of letting him torture that settled things between them and now he gets to start over, Vincent after him and Jules miraculously dodged bullets they had controversy on perception of this situation Jules decided that it was a sign to leave his criminal life and pursue righteousness and he did so he gets to live, while Vincent who arrogantly insist to neglect the chance and not to magnify it so that gets him killed.
the film got minor issues not in the narrative wise but in the pacing a little bit some scenes didn't really add up something to the main theme, but other than that the movie is a masterpiece."
1 July 2010,TedMichaelMor,4,7,9,Wonderful Film,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a remarkable movie. Watching it multiple times, I take pleasure in its mischievous exploitation of tropes as well as many other playful traits. I enjoyed calling it a great Lutheran movie—as I did for many years. There is a theological core to the narrative.The sister of a former friend deeply disparaged this movie to me. She felt it is pretentious with a celebration of decadence. I think she overreacted.The grace of the film emerges in expression of the clear love of cinema embodied here. I feel indebted to Quentin Tarantino for writing, directing, and acting. I deeply admire the superb and enchanting cinematography by Andrzej Sekuła. The work of co-writer Robert Avary is clearly vital. Sally Menke's insightful and gracious editing might be the most important component though here everything works.This film deserved careful viewing and critical analysis. The cast is one of the best ever assembled for any film. There is no false note anywhere in casting. I particularly enjoy watching ""Ving"" Rhames though pointing out any actor over another here seem unfair. The same goes for favoring any sequence in the movie, but I do love ""the Bonnie situation"".Those who finally financed this masterwork showed great artistic sense. We are in their debt. In particular, one somehow knows that Quentin Tarantino is the single most important genius behind this work. His touch is everywhere. The dialogue stays with one long after initial viewing."
26 October 2009,Sirus_the_Virus,4,8,10,One of the best.,"John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and a ton of others star in one of the best films of all time, Pulp fiction. The movie is brilliantly made with a ton of action, laughs, and awesomeness. Tarentino hasn't done a better film in his career. That means something, because the guy hasn't had a bad film yet in his career. I couldn't agree with IMDb more. My favorite Tarentino movies are either this or Jackie Brown, which is very underrated. Both movies have a ton of plot, laughs, and action, and a great cast. Tarentino's films make you laugh even a parts that aren't supposed to be funny. Pulp fiction is a masterpiece.The film is a story of Vincent Vega and his friend Jules, two hit men. Vincent is asked by his boss to watch his wife(Played by Uma Thurman) for a night and gets her drugged up. Or she gets herself drugged up.Jules is thinking of retiring. The two guys get into some crazy situations. Another storyline in the film involves as boxer named Butch(Played by Bruce Willis) who is being hunted down by the Marsallis Wallace(played by Ving Rhames). That is who Vincent works for. The two of them get into some pretty crazy situations. Both of these tales are intertwined in a brilliant way. I forgot to mention another story plot. There is a couple(played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob a restaurant. A smart idea I think. All of these stories are intertwined in a brilliant fashion. This movie has some memorable scenes and quotes. Pulp fiction is a real classic and the comeback of John Travolta. All of the performances are great. In Be cool, they make many references to this movie. Perhaps not many, but a few. They really didn't have to. Because those who have seen this movie sure as hell aren't going to forget it.Pulp fiction:****/****"
7 June 2012,lars_hendrikx,4,6,10,An Excellent Movie,"This movie is definitely my favorite movie.Like every movie of Quentin Tarantino i've seen, the dialogues in this movie are of great quality. Two mobsters discussing the wonders of Amsterdam and its weed or the name of a cheeseburger in Paris makes them seem like normal people. I especially liked the discussion between Vincent and Pitt about massaging feet.What I found admirable is that a simple feature as a toilet plays a part in this movie. When Vincent and Pitt take care of Brad and his friends who messed up a deal with Marsellus Wallace their last accomplice hides in toilet. When Vincent goes to the toilet at Mia's after their date(or wasn't it a date?) Mia mistakes his heroine for cocaine and overdoses. When Vincent is done at the toilet he finds her. When Vincent goes to the toilet at the restaurant and the restaurant gets robbed.Overall, I love this movie and I think it absolutely deserves its spot among the best movies out there. Superb acting, good plot line, a must see."
8 December 2004,malkane316,4,8,10,Quick Reviews!!,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Possibly the most iconic film of the decade, and easily one of the best, Pulp Fiction is brimming with innovation, top class acting and jazzy dialogue. Tarantino weaves together a number of stories seamlessly, featuring gangsters and scumbags, violence and drugs, pop culture and art, and makes a perfectly coherent and enjoyable movie. The script is witty, the techniques he uses to tell the story are refreshing, The soundtrack is excellent, and used as part of the story, the dialogue is sharp but not cheesy or over the top, and the direction shows great skill and focus. Like The Godfather, and many other 'classic' films i have reviewed, there isn't much more i can say that hasn't been said before, except that this is the most recent film that has warranted that status. I still prefer Reservoir Dogs though. 9 out of 10"
30 December 2009,thesar-2,3,6,9,I didn't go into Burger King.,"""Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead."" Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best crafted movies of all time. Sure, it's out of order and some people (including some dear to me) got confused, but it's so well made in the sections it's presented, it deserves to be on the top of all people's best of lists.Yeah, it contains violence and a lot of it. Some language and it's excessive. And believe it or not, for being a ""guy's movie"" it contains full frontal male-nudity (thanks, Bruce.) But, it's creative, inventive, original and a helluva lot of fun.There's a dozen or more subplots to explore, but for the most part, it involves the zany adventures of Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson.) They're enlightened hit men or simply, employees of one Marsellus (Rhames) and they're on a mission to retrieve a golden briefcase. In the interim, they accidentally shoot someone, get shot or dance off with a drug addict.To be perfectly honest, despite the previous paragraph's spoilers, there's so much going on in this movie, it's hard to describe everything that happens. Needless to say, you MUST see this movie.It contains the following: excellent acting, great comebacks/tributes (Travolta and Stoltz amongst others,) wonderful dialogue, comedy, cinematography, soundtrack, score, originality and enormous breakthrough for a director/writer (Tarantino) who is likely to go down as one of the best directors/writers of all time.I have practically memorized the soundtrack and quotes. And even the joke involving tomatoes. It's rich and deserves an audience from the 1990s to present. Perhaps Tarantino didn't know what impact he would have with his ""fictional"" story. But anyone that's seen this knows what a master he was when he created this world.I have no problem for saying the following words: Alfred Hitchcock is a favorite of mine. Tarantino is drawing very near to the master Hitchcock was. As crazy as Tarantino may appear, he knows what he wants, he knows how to spin an extremely creative yarn and he doesn't seem to care if anyone else agrees. To me, I hold him in the highest respect for his visions."
5 January 2021,Zabazhanov,5,6,10,Tarantino is a genius,"Around the tenth time I finally learned to watch Pulp Fiction as if the film was a good comedy, though not the kindest and not quite a comedy. Basically, all this concerns the beginning with Tim Roth, a couple of Travolta - Samuel L. Jackson, very rarely I watch until the moment when Uma Thurman comes out on the dance floor. Then I twist and watch the end of the story with car laundering and philosophical conversations in a restaurant. All the same, these topics with a clock in the ass (by the way, I never remembered the name of this actor.He forever became for me the one who kept the clock in the ass for Bru Willes), the diseases of Uma Thurman, the perverted policemen - I safely skip all this ... What's new about Pulp Fiction? This skillful incendiary conceptual kitsch invigorates with something that you never admit, even to yourself. The obvious idea that a bandit is also a person, like his own son, dangerous, but dear, in American real life with a century-old tradition of gangsterism, does not seem to be something unhealthy, on the contrary, the human dignity of the same Travolta or Jackson seems normal, without any questions about some kind of law, only some other values. The film, in fact, is about the fact that everyone sets their own rules for themselves, corresponding to their capabilities and imaginations. Soundtracks have become classics, phrases from the film are common to all mankind, and Tarantino is a cult figure. I can't wait - I can't wait for his next film. And the screams of Amanda Plummer at the very beginning should be listened to only in the original."
24 June 2008,cem92003,32,75,1,Excessive violence to cover up artistic default,"Sam Peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films. ""Dirty Harry"" series from the same era played by Clint Eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality either.So are ""Scarface"" and ""Body Double"" of Brian Da Palma from the 1980s. In all the above however, there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score. On the other hand, lacking the essentials of cinematography, the violence in all Quentin Tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void. A young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in ""Natural Born Killers"". One of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Still in this one, a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword. Still in another scene, having been shot in the groin, a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals. Now I don't see where is the fun of in all these. More important, where is the art in all these so that almost all Q.T brand films have earned such high ratings ? Apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as ""yep"", ""yeah"" , ""right"" and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks, what is the idea behind? That violence and sordidness have become an integral part of American society ? Well, after all that is their choice and they have to live with that, but at least don't sell this crap to elsewhere. If you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia/mob genre by masters such as Scorcese or Dilaurentis or Coppola, blood and gore unavoidably creeps in. However, there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous Q.T make. I might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards, but somehow I don't fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab U.S highways."
8 May 2009,I_am_worst_at_what_I_do_best,16,40,1,Terrible,"I was hyped to watch this, I thought it would be great, but it left a lot of unanswered questions floating in my head. More like THE WHOLE MOVIE! All this movie is about it people snorting drugs, getting killed and all the rest of the ""sucktacularity."" Who are these characters? Why do they think they're angels? Why does Quentin cameo in the movie? Why are there gay cops. I've seen Death Proof, and thought it was SPECTACULAR. I don't know why everyone thinks this is so great. The characters have no personality. The movie seemed like it left you to make the story full circle. Some movies do that and achieve it, but this one makes me feel to be asking questions rather than answering them. Bottom line, terrible movie.1/10"
11 August 2017,stebird,2,3,10,A Royale with cheese please!,"An epic landmark in film making brought to you by everyone's favourite madman Mr Tarantino..., Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential films of the last thirty years and maybe of all time. Quentin Tarantino became a cinematic auteur after only his second film and lay down the yard stick for which all other directors strive to be; a completely original film like nothing seen before, revolutionary at the time and still revolutionary now, maybe more so?It non-linear form of storytelling was a masterstroke, adding something unique and dynamic to the crime story contained within, on the surface Pulp Fiction's plot would've been samey and flat if not for the magic Tarantino threw at it.On a whole other level is the dialogue, Tarantino's legacy will include his unique approach to making everlasting and brilliant dialogue, Pulp Fiction is the perfect example of realistic yet overly tongue-in-cheek usage of the spoken word. The opening scene with Jules and Vincent driving along to their next job is a shining example, talking about the most obscure and silly things like what do Europeans call a quarter pounder with cheese..., a Royale with cheese, because of the metric system, in my view this is one of the greatest quotes in cinema, stupidly simple and random but so effective.The acting is sublime and masterful, John Travolta's performance alone relaunched his career and made him an A list star once again..., it also has to be the shining light in Sam Jackson's career, he was given the ball and he ran with it truly, announcing himself to the world in the process.The side story involving Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge added another amazing dimension to an already incredible film, and Tarantino expertly linked the story in to the rest of the film like a pro.Cinematic excellence and it just goes to show how well independent films can be if you give them the chance, an independent film by a relatively unknown at the time director has gone on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time and for very good reason.Essential viewing for any budding film fan, a film that must be near the top of every list..., one of the best ever, I salute you Quentin Tarantino, cinema is a better place because of you sir!"
25 August 2021,momjessicaandjordan,1,1,10,I Shot Marvin In The Face!!,"This movie is an example of a perfect film. Great Story, Great Dialogue, Great Characters etc. Its very enjoyable. Vincent was definitely my favorite character, he was funny without even trying especially shooting Marvin in the car scene. It's very laughable to even have your suspect and you pointing a gun at him. That later catches up to him as he is tragically killed around the end. Those bullets that missed Vincent at Marvins Apartment lol, that's karma right there. I did not expect that. Samuel L Jackson was great as well. He did keep his cool and him being in literally 100,000 movies in his career, what more can you expect from a legendary actor like Samuel. I recommend this movie 100 percent. You will hopefully (For the people who have mixed feelings about the movie) not be disappointed."
27 April 2018,girlluver1,4,7,10,"And you will know my name is the lord, when I lay my vengeance upon thee!","I could write an entire novel reviewing this movie. So let's start off with the one negative which is likely the most common issue for those who don't like the movie. It's not action packed and it's not gory like kill bill or django. But what this story lacks in action sequences it more than makes up for with unique dialogue, completely original story (and story telling). When this movie ends and you turn off the TV it leaves one pondering about life and the choices we make. Everyone in this movie learns a lesson; whether or not they get lucky or learn them the hard way. You'll be able to sympathize or empathize with a vast majority of the characters (a few stragglers aside). The non linear chapter set up for this movie might leave one confused at first, but you have to observe each segment as their own movie then try to connect the dots (harder to do than it sounds). To this date there has not been a role that fits Sam Jackson as well as his character in this movie. And even though the last chapter is technically not the ""ending"" it works much more as such. I would not consider this an action suspense film; I would feel better calling it a very dark comedy. But if anyone reads this review all the way through and hasn't watched it yet. Do so now and even if you don't like the film you still have to appreciate its originality."
3 December 2019,Horst_In_Translation,8,31,6,"Occasionally great, overall a genuinely entertaining movie","""Pulp Fiction"" is an American film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course Mr. Quentin Tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his 3rd filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know Reservoir Dogs from his very early years. Anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a Palme d'Or, but also introoduced him to and kept him at the Oscars for years, no decades to come. Until this day, in fact. So lets take a look at what is most memorable about Pulp Fiction. I think last night was maybe the third time I watched this movie and the first time at a theater. It's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 hightest-rated movies, currently at #8, but it was even top5 a few years ago I think. Anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. Enough said about the movie's popularity. So many have seen it.As for the film's success with awards bodies, I already mentioned something, but it also needs to be said that Tarantino won a Screenplay Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA for his writing and that is of course a huge trifecta achievement and he was really young back then, so truly nice that he certainly delivered in the decades afterwards. I cannot really think of one filmmaker these days around the age of 30 with such a bold unique approach to filmmaking. You can really see in almost every scene how big of a film nerd Tarantino is. And his cast here profited a lot from that too. Travolta got an Oscar nomination. He deserved it. Uma Thurman did too and I am not so sure about her. Love her in Kill Bill and recent films where she is a scene stealer with very little screen time when working with Lars von Trier, but I don't know if her performance here is really good enough for a nomination, even if I am quite fond of her in general. And then there is Samuel L. Jackson of course. Everybody who knows him (only) as Nick Fury needs to see his works with Tarantino. He is so good in here, such a memorable character, easily the best from the film. And he worked a lot with Q afterwards too. His turn in the Foxx/DiCaprio/Waltz western is also magnificent. But back to this one here: I would say basically the first scene when he and Travolta enter the apartment is when the film is at its best. Judging from this one only, I would have given 4 stars out of 5 and said it is one of my favorite films of the year, but sadly it does not stay that great when we have the Butch scenes (even if also for Willis, it is a contender for career-best) and also the long sequence with Travolta and Thurman and also the final scene at the restaurant again with SLJ.Now I would like to speak about a few very specific scenes and moments and, in general, inclusions that stayed in my mind here. First of all, the restaurant with all these waiters in costume was amazing. I totally wanna go there. Did not even recognize Buscemi as Buddy Holly, even if I knew he worked with Q in Reservoir Dogs. Another great actor. Same for Harvey Keitel, even if he is not one of my favorites like Buscemi. Still Mr. Wolf is such an icon. When SLJ's character hears Marsellus is sending the Wolf, it is so hilarious. We know immediately that dude is a respectable fella who knows exactly what he is doing. I'd be happy to have Mr. Wolf bark orders at me and he also would have deserved his own film. I think he had a little cameo in another Tarantino work. This character has aged really well, just like the film as a whole. Then the food: The Kahuna Burger even makes me as a vegetarian immediately wanna take a bite. And that milkshake at the restaurant! Totally worth it. Kinda hilarious by today's standards how five bucks is a lot of money for a milkshake back then. But boy is it worth it. Even Vincent agrees. Speaking of Vincent, there is a lot I can say about him. Not just his funny posture at the Wallace residence that has been used for many memes, but also for example how keeping stuff secret when everybody goes their own way is something that occurs twice after somewhat memorable events during which characters are in life-threatening situations. You will know what I mean when you see the scenes. But an act of courage and integrity by one character (even if it is indirectly also about saving one's own life in both scenarios) saves the other person too.As for Tarantino: He once again also acts in here just like he did in some of his movies, also the much later one with Waltz, SLJ and Leo I mentioned earlier. There his inclusion is probably even more fun than here. But I still loved how he makes fun of himself directing in this one we got here during the water splashing scene near the end when he is basically directing Keitel in-character. Hilarious moment. Coincidence is also a big factor in this film we have here. What if... can be asked on so many occasions. What if the girl (the stunning Maria de Medeiros) had not forgotten the ring? Vega would not have been killed and actually this really put major emphasis on SLJ's character's decision. Had he not retired, could he have been there too, killed Butch and saved Vega? What if Vega had not left the gun in the room? What if Butch had never run into Marsellus when driving back to his girl. What if all these bullets had not missed the two during the apartment? What if Vega had not accidentally killed the boy in the car. No Tarantino and Keitel in this film then. And they would not have ended at the restaurant where in the end the circle really closes and even if I do prefer chronological films most of the time, there is no denying the lack of chronology here works very well. For example we see Vega knowing he is going to die later on. Charming moment also between Willis and Travolta when they meet for the first time.Okay, now one aspect and recurring joke I want to talk a bit about too.: Vincent Vega's toilet breaks. Every time he takes a bathroom break, catastrophe ensues outside really. Be it Mia ODing, the guys at the restaurant launching their robbery or Butch entering the apartment making toast for himself. Or indirectly also the guy at the apartment who storms outside. Okay this is not Vega taking a toilet break, but still the bathroom is really an aspect there too. This really shows you the bizarre humor Tarantino includes in his movies all the time. Kinda symbolic how toilets are significant here. And Vega apparently also does not have the best bladder or bowel movement with hof often he goes. He even asks for a toilet break at his dealer's apartment after they reached an agreement. Hilarious stuff. There are many other scenes about which you will laugh. Like for example when we see Marsellus with heavy injuries from the accident ""walk"" towards Butch in order to kill him and he walks like a zombie basically firing left and right. Or the toast moment I just mentioned giving us a parallel on what/who is finished that very moment. Or also the anecdote told by Walken's character about the gold watch. I mean it is meaningful, even historically meaningful in a sense, but at the same time it is also a reference on a guy hiding a watch for years in his butthole. It's kinda gross humor, but never childish fart humor or something like that. There is so much creativity and even intellect to it that it is a really great achievement and I am happy Tarantino received all this awards recognition for his work here. By the way, it is also a rare occurence that he is not the only one credited with the script.Finally, still one minor scene that stayed in the head for me, namely how they say when they enter the apartment (where a familiar face from NCIS is in btw.) they should have brought bigger guns because there are many thugs inside (also referenced later when there was one more than they expected, so Q even delivered in terms of mathematics) and with how Vega actually brought a big gun for one enemy (i.e. for a big gun) to Butch's apartment, but it wasn't enough, so taking care of your gun and situation is eventually more important than what kind of firearm(s) you bring. And the (non-chronological) ending scene is also memorable not just again for Jackson (even if I prefer him laying actual gun vengeance on people), but also because it is pretty much the only scene and sequence in which nobody is injured and people leave the restaurant all safe and sound, despite all the potential violence that could have happened in this scene, which also shows again that SLJ's character has sort of found his path to God. And there is no bloodshed. This would be all for my review then. I am a bit sad the film did not stay as strong as it started, but it is still a big fun ride and I recommend checking it out to everybody, even if it is not one of my favorites from Tarantino. SLJ's portrayal alone makes it worth watching I think and if you are one of the 3 or 4 on this planet who haven't seen it yet, then totally go for it or I will lay my vengeance upon you! Thumbs up."
14 March 2013,preston-luther,7,12,10,Pulp Fiction,"Perhaps no other director places the entertainment value over essentially everything else than the quirky Quentin Tarantino. As long as people laugh, smile, and share in a cinematically glorious viewing experience of idiosyncratic dialogue, wacky story lines, who honestly can find it within themselves to give a hollerin' hoot about anything else? After his directorial debut of ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino proved he possesses the talent to craft a screenplay and ultimately a film. Though a daring debut, ""Reservoir Dogs"" left out a majority of its action and subsequently more for the viewer to desire. With ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino delivers not only his best ever film, but a milestone in the delicate dexterity of original storytelling.In this film we see three interweaving stories involving hit men, a bank-robbing couple, a rogue boxer, and a near-fatal blind date. The two hit men, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, played by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta respectively, provide the two most outstanding performances. Samuel L. Jackson dominates the screen with his thunderous voice and unwavering demeanor in his portrayal of a ""cool- cat"" gangster. His partner in crime, John Travolta, also provides an intriguing and convincing performance that most assuredly rescued his career from the D-list depths of the ""Look Who's Talking"" series. Like ""Reservoir Dogs"", dialogue stands as the driving force behind the plot and characters of ""Pulp Fiction"". And not one line in the script lacks Tarantino's stamp of wit and cleverness. Characters speak fluently in wise-crack and tough guy throughout the plot, much like the cold-hearted noir heroes of the 40s such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe (both played by the late Humphrey Bogart). In one particular scene of retribution, the big man Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames, having endured the sexually unthinkable, promises to ""Go to work on the homes with a pair of pliers and a blow torch [] I'ma get medieval on you're a**."" Goodness knows what ""medieval"" may imply, but safe to say the guy's got a bit of pain lying in his future.Bruce Willis, who plays the down and out boxer, fails to throw a fight and thus suffers the pursuit of Marsellus and his gangsters. Eventually Marsellus and Willis wind up in a truly bizarre scene of mouth gags and homosexual perversion. Somehow Willis manages to find a way to escape the dastardly situation and get Marsellus off his back all at once. Wacky and uncanny? Indeed, but like the rest of the film, Tarantino tells it with such fun and enthusiasm that one can feel the entertainment buzzing like a jet engine. Most of the dialogue stands in stark contrast to the majority of Hollywood writing which functions simply to further along the plot. Characters continually engage each other with conversations in which we might find ourselves conversing, making it all the more convincing. Tarantino's dialogue reveals character and dimension. It does not offer standard, thin lines that reveal only what the audience already knows. This works to provide the feeling that we eavesdrop on the characters as they chit chat about miscellaneous topics such as the nomenclature of hamburgers, the sexual implications of foot massages, piercings, etc. Though the dialogue may at first glance appear obscure and irrelevant, it obliquely implies events to come later in the unfolding of the plot. For instance, the talk of fast-food cheeseburgers does not stop in Vincent's car; rather we see the hamburgers return in the next scene as Jules and Vincent interrupt the uneasy Brett and gang as they dine on Big Kahuna burgers. We don't simply hear the dialogue, but we see a clever reprisal of the dialogue. It functions to the lay the comical and violence-tempering groundwork for future scenes. The unusual discussion between Jules and Vincent about what exactly a foot massage signifies between a man and a woman most notably lays the groundwork for the tension throughout the long sequence between Vincent and Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman. Before their blind date, we learn that Marsellus Wallace threw a man off a balcony for merely giving his wife a foot massage. So if Marsellus Wallace nearly kills a man for touching his wife's feet, imagine what he would do if someone happened to accidentally, oh I don't know, kill his wife. Thus the problem Vincent faces on his date-gone awry with Mia Wallace. Marsellus just might go ""medieval"" again. Vincent knows this but most importantly the audience knows this. Tarantino cleverly crafts his dialogue to heighten the tension and anxiety of the scene, keeping our attention like a light trap and a fly.By the end, which I shan't ruin for it serves better to hear and watch than read, the film comes back around in full circle, ending where it started. The events in ""Pulp Fiction"" arrive jumbled and for the most part out of order, which undoubtedly helped inspire the increased number of non-linear narratives that pervade throughout Hollywood today. The different plot lines of ""Pulp Fiction"" connect in some way, but each possesses a life of its own and can thrive individually. Because of this no better title could serve the film quite like ""Pulp Fiction"" does. The dictionary describes the phrase""Pulp Fiction"" as ""fiction dealing with lurid or sensational subjects."" Tarantino delivers sensation and he does so with smart dialogue, exuberant direction, and an array of actors that perform with just the right mixture of tough-guy wit and comedy."
20 April 2020,ferni-tierni,1,1,10,Be the Shepherd,"Pulp Fiction is a lesson that even if people act on their best intentions, if they are surrounded by evil or around bad influences, there are so many events outside of their control that they are bound to be punished eventually. This is why Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to liberate himself from the ""evil life"" after experiencing his divine intervention. He wanted to be good and inspire benevolence in people rather than symbolizing the tyranny of evil men. In almost all the scenes of the movie we get reminded how destructive and grim situations can become if characters do not decide to live a life of virtue and responsibility. The verse recited by Jules progressively gains more power as we navigate the protagonist's desire for vengeance or restitution. It is the metaphor that if you initiate the process of changing your thoughts (biblical verse) maybe actions (forgiving pumpkin) might follow and also habits and life in general.As is customary in Tarantino's films, the majority of the characters have temerity, choleric temperament, unforgiving, and reckless decision making. Vincent (John Travolta) accidentally shoots his friend on the face while Jules drives the car. Mia (Uma Thurman) overdoses with cocaine and has to be revived by Vincent with an adrenaline shot to heart. Butch (Bruce Willis) decides to run over Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) on the street and ends up destroying his girlfriend's car. Marcellus and Butch fight on a weapon's store, and they get restrained, tied up, and sodomized by strangers. Tarantino was dead set on sending a message that if you are participating in illegal, immoral, or destructive behavior, you will get punished by destiny, fate, or god.The dialogue is some of the best I have seen in movies: Vincent's casual stories of Amsterdam, Jules and Vincent conversation on the comparison of feet massage and oral sex, the biblical verse Jules recites to his victims, pumpkin's description of how restaurants is the best place to rob. By these scenes the characters received personality, charisma, ideology, convictions. We get a glimpse into their life and aspirations; we understand their motivations. All of these instances give flavor and atmosphere to the movie that gives us a sense of novelty and originality.The astute part is that most of the characters seem reasonable and humane despite their murderous behavior. This adds more to the message of the movie that humanity can still be recovered after falling into the valley of darkness. The tension was not as good as some of his other movies, but the scenes compensate it with other cinematographic content. Jules scenes in the restaurant robbery and in the recovery of the briefcase were intense, smart, ruthless, charismatic, audacious, and original."
22 December 2005,myschrec,1,1,7,Style over substance,"Quentin Tarantino's film is very dramatic and engaging. The acting -- especially by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson -- is outstanding. The slicing of the time line is awkward at times, but it demands attention and makes a repeat viewing valuable, if not necessary. Nevertheless, in the end I ask myself: What I have learned? Where has this film taken me? It is like taking a wild roller coaster ride. It is worth riding again. But I cannot put it in the same category of great films that raise important issues or dramatize a moral dilemma. It does not have the philosophical dimension of great cinema like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""The Seven Samurai,"" or ""Monsieur Verdoux."" On the contrary, it's near glorification of gratuitous violence -- not matter how cinematic -- is ultimately offensive."
27 December 2009,elkabousmehdi,4,7,8,A Tour De force ''Modern-Classic'' Movie !!,"Pulp fiction is certainly one of those films that will always be remembered for their emotional impact that they bring on while you watching them, Quentin Tarantino's master piece came to reveal and put on a high stage one of the world best film directors.What impressed me about Tarantino's gem was its plot, actually the plot provoked many critics, it intrigues everyone that watched the movie, but I would say the most important part in the plot was the characters as Samuel L.Jackson mentioned at the beginning of the film '' Come on, let's get in character'' all the characters involved in the movie were vivid and each one with his or her specific added values.The plot can be divided into three different stories, as long as the film is progressing they getting close to each other, as it is unveiled in the last coffee shop scene. Well it will take me more than that to describe the contribution of each character, but to sum it all up Characters were master key to put the film into a maverick joy.The music played an important role starting from the first scene with ''dick dale's pulp fiction Soundtrack'' illustrating a perfect start, and coming to one of the most entertaining scene when Vincent and Mia came on the stage to perform a dance that astonishingly matches with ''Chuck Burry's song- C'est la vie'', there are various of good music throughout the film.Pulp fiction was purely entertaining from the beginning to its last seconds, and it's a film that you have to watch multiple times, each time it will keep dazzling you. That's what an Entertaining movie should look like!! Highly recommended!!!"
22 December 2009,brlfrndz,4,7,10,More than just pop culture references,"I can honestly say that this is my second favorite movie! My favorite is The Matrix. But let's get back to this. Yes, the movie is stylish and hilarious but it has a lot of meaning to it. Some say it's just one of those movies that are pointless and good. That's not true and ill tell you why: The reason they recite all those pop culture references within the movie just show that they constantly use these things to force meaning into their lives.You'll notice how Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) changes during the robbery scene at the ending of the movie. He said something about if this were a few hours ago I would have killed you already. Jules recited a Bible verse every time he killed someone to sound cool and meaningful. He was just trying to force some meaning into his life. When Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules were shot at, they didn't die. It was a miracle according to the movie, and only Jules would acknowledge that. Vincent just said ""whatever"". Then later on Vincent is killed by Butch(Bruce Willis) because he didn't quit working for Marcelles Wallace and he didn't change. Jules did change. That's why he got killed. That is just too thrilling to know.10/10"
4 May 2016,ninabruzdzinski,1,1,9,Loved this,"This is another film I have always heard about. I love John Travolta as an actor and thought this was an exceptional film. For some reason I always thought this film was a horror film, and that is the reason why I have never watched it before, horror is not my thing. Although there was violence, it was nothing I couldn't handle. I loved the comedic relief throughout the entirety of the film. After seeing this film, I now understand why it is so popular and why it is raved about so much. The plot was very interesting and kept me wanting more. I would definitely watch this film again, which in my opinion is what makes a movie so great- wanting to see it more than once. I'm glad this was an option for this weeks film because I don't think I would've just watched it on my own."

26 April 2020,bs-50198,1,1,9,Nobody gets the title...,"I love this film dont get me wrong. But has nobody wondered why its titled pulp fiction?
Then lays out the definitions of pulp and fiction. The genius part of this project is it's about nothing! Theirs no meaning to any of it.
That is why so much random stuff happens that would never happen. Its deliberately screwing with you. Also when asked what is in the case tarentino still screws with people and says I'll never tell. Because it's nothing!"
8 January 2022,oliver-96856,1,1,10,The greatest 1990s film by Quentin Tarantino.,This is the best 1990s movie i have ever seen. That movie has everything the acting was top-notch. And the scenes was fun and amazing and the plot was really good. And the camera angles was good at best. And the music was good. And thanks to quentin Tarantino and john travolta and uma thurman and samuel l. Jackson and bruce willis. For have acted in this movie. 10/10.
12 May 2020,m-18130,1,1,10,The best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
28 December 2021,ummzara,1,1,10,nah,"S Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive."
28 August 2009,biology_79,88,190,1,A movie to forget,"This is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece. I don't know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie. Everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there, but a good cast doesn't mean that the movie is a masterpiece. This movie was without a subject, no message, too much repeated sentences, nothing connected with each other. You will get tired of listening to duologue's about ""foot massage"", ""hamburgers"", ""Butch's fathers watch"" .etc, these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie.I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. This movie is way overrated and should be among ""IMBD 100 Bottom"". If you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologue's without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch The Shawshank Redemption."
19 December 2020,m918kiss,4,6,10,great movie,"It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity."
14 July 2014,tanvirashraf-417-537565,38,95,1,nothing but a bullshit art-house stuff,"i watched the film 20 years later since it's making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering it's 5h top position on IMDb. The movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant, appealing sketching of it's theme. The dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose it's rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characters's stand, view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive.The one thing, the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is Bruce Willis part of a boxer, who is feared but not a coward. The rare male protagonist with conscience.Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time"
17 August 2014,FlashCallahan,1,2,10,"You play with matches, you get burned.....","Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace.

Things go smoothly until one of them makes a huge error. Butch Coolidge is a boxer has been approached by Marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight. When Butch ends up killing the other boxer, he must escape Marsellus. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are two lovebirds who have decided to rob the restaurant they're currently eating at. But the restaurant doesn't turn out to be as easy as the other places they've robbed.......I can't say anything about this film that no one hasn't said before, but the film is phenomenal, its groundbreaking, and its one of the coolest films ever to be released in the nineties.But why is it? It's because its flawless, seamless, and no matter how many times you see the movie (and I guarantee, you will see it more than five times), it never gets boring, and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention.Tarantino has crafted a timeless movie, and it will be remembered in years, and years, and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces, alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and The Godfather.The cast are impeccable, and this film resurrected two flagging careers in Willis and Travolta, especially Travolta, whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold, and it's down to this.Plus don't forget, not many people had heard of Samuel L. Jackson before this, and after this, he's been in nearly every film ever made since, and you watch them, because you are waiting for that Jules Winfield magic.Every scene is wonderful, every set piece is perfect, and the script is sparkling, its pure gold.The weak link in the film? Tarantino's cameo, but hey, this is his invention, so I'll let him off.One of the last great films ever made."

                        ",Bring Out The Gimp,"""Tarantino seems to be too concerned with other films. I mean, about appropriating other movies, like a blender. I think it's really funny at the time I'm seeing it, but then, I don't know, there's a void there. Some of the references are flat, just pop culture."" - Harmony Korine ""It's like watching a schoolboy's fantasy of violence and sex, which normally Tarantino would be ******* alone to in his bedroom while his mother is making him baked beans downstairs. Only this time he's got Harvey Weinstein behind him and it's on a million screens."" - Nick Broomfield ""Thirty years ago it would have been widely accepted that objective knowledge about society and history was an asset for a filmmaker. Today, such an attitude is considered a hindrance. This is a temporary state of affairs, but a costly and destructive one. Art, including bad art, has consequences."" - David Walsh Quentin Tarantino directs ""Pulp Fiction"", a shamelessly lurid homage to early B-movies, printed pulp fiction (the dime-store tales of the 1940s-50s, and later pulp imitators - sometimes called ""new pulp"" - like Elmore Leonard and Charles Bukowski, whose own ""Pulp"" was released in 1994), Robert Aldrich (""Kiss Me Deadly""), ""Farewell My Lovely"", ""Pickup on South Street"" and Godard (""Band of Outsiders"", ""Vivre sa Vie"", ""Alphaville""). Nods to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Truck Turner"" (the same comic monologues), ""Karate Kiba"" (Jackson's religious monologues repeated verbatim), ""On The Waterfront"", ""The Colour of Money"" (""character"" vs ""having character"" conversation), ""The Parent Trap"" (Uma drawing an animated square on screen, also from ""The Three Little Bops""), ""Repo Man"" (glowing briefcase; see also Aldrich), ""Charley Varrick"" (lifted lines, as well as the torture scene), ""Psycho"", ""Lili"" (everything about the Fabienne character), ""Easy Rider"", ""God of Gamblers"" (violence whenever Travolta goes to the bathroom), ""Three Days of the Condor"" (Vincent's death), ""Shoot the Piano Player"", ""Jules and Jim"", ""The Panic in Needle Park"" (the whole overdose fiasco), ""Policewoman"" (stylized credit sequence), and ""The Night Of The Hunter"" come next, all shoehorned before or after an extended sequence in a movie-themed restaurant in which all of Tarantino's references sit back, chill out and relax.The film is dense with allusions (Uma's two dances are taken directly from ""Band of Outsiders"" and ""Vivre sa Vie"", as is her haircut), cribbed shots and referenced dialogue, Tarantino packing the film to the brim with nods to esoteric art films, mainstream fare, trashy exploitation films and television programmes (""Kung Fu"", ""Captain Kangaro"", ""Happy Days"", ""Cops""). Characters likewise either work on TV shows (""Force Five""), knowingly repeat lines from movies (""Zardoz"", ""Guns of Navarone"" etc) and documentaries (Scorsese's ""American Boy"" is the source of Lance's needle instructions) or are themselves named after songs (""Flock of Seagulls""), movies or movie characters (eg Tony ""Rocky Horror"" named after the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""English Bob"" after a character in ""Unforgiven"" and Keitel's ""The Wolf"" based on a similar character in ""Victor the Cleaner""). Posters of countless films are likewise littered throughout, as well as references to film directors (a ""Douglas Sirk steak"" - aka a steak with ""All That Heaven Allows""). Some of the allusions are brief (boxer Bruce Willis' comes home after a fight and yells his girl's name like Stallone does in ""Rocky""), whilst some are deliberately extended and toyed with.Some actors in the film even acknowledge their own roles in other films, Christopher Walken's character just coming back from ""Deer Hunter's"" Nam, Travolta's echoing his role in ""Saturday Night Fever"" and Ving Rhames' Marsellus Wallace delivering a monologue exactly like his character in ""Casualties of War"". Rhames' gimp suit encounter even echoes another gimp suit encounter in ""The People Under The Stairs"", also with Rhames. Cinematic pop cultural references even bleed into print references (Travolta reading ""Modesty Blaise"" etc), while the film's self-consciously fake process shots recall Dick Richards' noirs. Even the famous ""Quarter Pounder"" monologue is cribbed, and much of the character ramblings recall Jean Paul Belmondo in ""Breathless"".The film is structured as a series of short stories – all loosely connected and deliberately trashy – but within these stories are themselves characters who constantly take time out to tell equally digressive short stories. In this way the film is a tale about people telling tales, and so plays like a celebration of oration, of yapping, of a hundred and twenty years of seedy storytelling. Ironically, the film's best short story is that in which the characters decide to ""say nothing"". To shut up.Under postmodernism, art is inherently self absorbed, self-reflexive, de-structured, de-centred, fragmented, parasitic and churned out by artists whose media-saturated landscapes become ""all that there is to reality"". Such artists live in a kind of cocoon, seeking only to replicate past pleasures. This is a cinema of artifacts and furnishings. Of attitude, copied poses and interchangeable and indistinguishable references. Here, life is only an extension of media, everything is false and all that matters are gestures and role playing. And like other postmodern films, Tarantino's aesthetic is a seductive kind of hyper-stylisation, everything not only in quotes and supremely self conscious, but celebratory of self consciousness.""Pulp Fiction"" is entertaining (and its narrative has a breezy, liberative quality), much better written than its imitators and one passage in particular, which plays with the classic cliché of ""the bodyguard and the bosses wife"", is graceful, low key and romantic. Much of the film is surprisingly inhumane, though, a kind of jokey 1970s exploitation movie in which people are either doped up, stabbed by needles, raping black men or coldly slaughtering teens while making grand speeches. Because the film exists in a certain moral vacuum (""It's just a film"", ""It's supposed to be trash"", ""It's pulp ****ing fiction!""), stuff like anal rape and murder are all played for snickers and kicks.8/10 - The ""Repo Man"" of the 90s?"
19 August 2010,jackrs4562,8,15,10,A Masterpiece,"After watching this movie, I knew it was going to be a masterpiece. I mean, it's classic Tarantino. And, it's got everyone who is anyone in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and so many more. It was nominated for several Academy Awards. But, what really struck me, was the witty dialogue and hilarious scenes between Vega and Jules. And, what scene is more remembered than the dancing scene with Vega and Mia? The story is in 3 parts, all put together, flawlessly. The ending was clever and really made you ""think"". Oh, and the Big Mac scene in the beginning, genius!"
17 July 2008,dave_wlogan,3,6,9,"Comebacks, confirmations and class","OK the first thing one can say about this film is brilliant. 2nd thing is Tarantino is one of the great filmmakers. 3rd thing is Travolta is fantastic.Pulp Fiction is a film where he linked stories intensely intriguing and each one offers a different kind of entertainment. The syringe, the bible passage (Ezeikiel 25;17) and the Gimp. How does one single mind think of these ideas let alone link them in a screenplay and then transfer this onto film. Each shot is cleverly composed and the shots used appropriately. The only thing that annoyed me about Tarantinos effort was how he knew he was good but wasn't sure we knew. By that I mean the use of some techniques like the steady-cam shot at Jack Rabbit Slims, i felt it was unnecessary but i got over it.Travolta and Jackson give of so much charisma and energy its unbelievable. It's a shame Jackson never achieved this level of form again. But this performance shows what the two are capable of. Travolta acted so well he has become known as 'the Comeback Kid' (got that from Empire) and it's true that Pulp Fiction has reinvented what kind of actor he is. Thurman gives a decent effort and Bruce Willis performed better than expected, and Ving Rhames was so believable as Marcellus Wallace. Tim Roth gave a fantastic little performance, he's one of my favourite actors in all of Tarantinos works. So the cast was at its best.The soundtrack is phenomenal but what do you expect from a Tarantino film. Each song is chosen for a different purpose and interestingly during the more dramatic sequences he didn't use music like he did in the ear cutting scene during Reservoir Dogs. Which brings us to the script. Similar to Dogs but in its own way it is both better and equal. For instance before they are let into the apartment to pick up the case the conversation between Jules and Vincent is immensely funny.This is THE film of the 90s. Also catch Fight Club, Trainspotting and Lock, Sotck and Two Smoking Barrels for other classics."
20 September 2007,katana-t,4,7,10,Pulp Fiction As The New Testament of Cinema.,"Pulp Fiction As The New Testament of Cinema.Tarantino is always the body and the spirit of his movies, his movies don't exist apart from his personality and he is there (Mr.Brown, Jimmie, Chester Rush, Warren) personally to mark his territory. Tarantino is close 'cause we see him in his movies  Rodriguez don't pet us with cameos, while he is times more attractive than Cutie Anyways, when I first saw Pulp Fiction I was 13. Next day at school everybody was discussing that movie, our hips were saying ""Tarantino"" about a hundred times a minute. I was never hip, so when I asked which of them was Tarantino, they gave me a look that could kill. ""Tarantino is THE DIRECTOR, and by the way, he played there too."" It was very funny  they considered knowing that so valuable, to me it was no more than just ""a"" movie then. ""Who did he play?"" I asked. When they told me I was shocked: ""What?! That pathetic imbecile in the robe was actually the director?!!!"" How could I know that that imbecile's IQ is 160 to my 118, but I didn't know it then and I didn't care.Funny, that exact dialogue that made me revere Tarantino years later, that dialogue is cut off the most of the copies of the movie, and the Cannes saw the cut version too. At least, the script is available for free and anyone can enjoy the full version, which contains even the unfilmed scenes.The main dialogue of the movie is cut. It is where Mia is giving Vince a third degree. It is here where Tarantino speaks himself and for himself (even though everyone in his movies is Tarantino, even bacteria in the actors' sweat speak Tarantino ""F"" English, still here it is his dream and his dream-girl), it's his fantasy, it's the questions he wanted to answer  he actually dreamed of getting beaten up by a girl, he loves Amazons, and his other works prove it (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol.1, Death Proof, etc.) Only strong men like to see strong women by their side.Tarantino and Roger Avary share the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but actually the full script was written by Cutie only, the stories were developed together. It was Roger Avary who developed the hideous rape scene, he said about that like all writers do  the characters did that on their own to the author's surprise, because he is a nice person, who would never invent something like that.Anyway, it's a movie that arouses a wide variety of interpretation, from seeing the deepest philosophical ""ditch"" in it to the calling it the lowest pop chuck, to me it is a classic Tarantino, and that says it all. He loved to see his beautiful child with the people, he would go to the cinema and watch it every time like the first time with them, noticing when they tensed and when they laughed, being tensed and laughing with them, being the happiest guy in the whole wide world then. I really think that he was the happiest guy then, you wouldn't find another like him.Well, there is one thing I hate when some very sophisticated and very spiritual specimen start to zoom around about some irony of the movie, the irony of Cutie, who is against violence on the screen, and in his movie he is saying: ""People, look at what you are doing, and stop!"", and they say it in such a pompous voice that it makes me almost physically sick. One of them happened to blabber in that way in my company. She had some good ideas too  she pointed out  it is not the bodies that shock, it is the attitude towards them that does. That is a nice phrase that sums up the reason why his movies seem to be and they are extra-violent. Okay, but then she goes again  people, look blah-blah-blah. I couldn't stand any longer: I told her about the first script, where Vince shot Marvin in the throat, and then with Tarantino little talk shot him in the head, Cuite changed that scene into one shot in the head  she was happy and said: ""Because it is softer!"", ""No, - I gloated, - HE actually said himself that he changed that because the straight shot in the head was FUNNIER"". She almost freaked out.Look, you may see anything you want in it, even Nostradamus prophecy, but keep in mind, that Tarantino is a brilliant guy who loves action, crime and kung-fu movies just for the fun of it, and we love him for that. You may see anything you want in Marcellus's case (from Marcellus's soul to Da Vinci manuscripts), but keep in mind that Tarantino and Avary concealed its contents only because their initial idea seemed too trivial to them  diamonds. They say: ""It depends on viewer's mind"", well, of course, it does, but I want to know what it is on your mind, that's why I watch your movie.So, one may see Da Vinci manuscripts, yet it may be plainly diamonds, but the movie is really epic. (I can't say that it's a must see, I don't like the word ""a must see"", like something forcing you into something) It is more than a fantastically good movie, it is the New Testament of cinema  new way of speaking in the movies, new way of storytelling, new way of being in the movies, new way of seeing the very movie-making idea."
1 November 2014,eragonbookfan,5,16,2,"""The Lion King"" should've been nominated for Best Picture! Not this overrated pile of nonsensical, worthless schlock!!","Happy 20th Anniversary ......NOT!!!Did I watch the exact same movie which SO many people have referred to and think it's some holy pop-cultural iconic movie??? I just don't get it, and I'll never get it!To be honest, I feel like calling this film ""Stupid People Going Around Doing Stupid Things"" - I'm not joking! One thing after the other in this movie just CONFUSED me! The entire time I was like ""HUH!?"" Everything about the story lines, occurrences, the dialogue, and the pay off was just stupid! And the f-bomb is dropped in every other sentence, so much so, I felt like punching the screen in! It's said so much to the extent where it gets really annoying! I like Samuel L. Jackson, especially for his Stars Wars and MARVEL superhero work, but I don't care if he's mostly known for this! I hate him playing such over-the-top, nonsensical, controversial characters!And I hate films that just take advantage of even white-washing the names of Christians, and have the bad guy quote Bible verses. That's dangerous! It's brainwashing & manipulation! (Want my advice of a real Christian is?? Rachel Scott of Columbine who was killed for her faith, Dietrich Bonhoeffer who spoke out against Hitler and Nazi Germany, or even Dr. Kent Hovind who reveals a lot of amazing scientific evidence for the fact of special Creation and Biblical accuracy.) All much better and meaningful then this overrated pile of worthless celluloid NOTHING!Though to be fair, I think Quentin does have an decent taste in soundtrack variety. I admit, I've got those songs on my iPod as a result of watching this flick. And I do think the scene of Christopher Walken's ""Watch"" talk does for some reason relax me, simply because it's simply WALKEN - his delivery & his way of talking is somewhat kind of relaxing and amusing all at once. He's been interesting ever since I saw him in the comedy ""Mousehunt"". Though the scene STILL is stupid when the captain (or general, whatever) curses at a young boy about the ""A$$"" and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many men's anuses for a long time.I mean, Tarantino's just some director I don't like or care about - he claims he's against drugs and violence... THEN DON'T MAKE FILMS ABOUT THEM! You may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence! You're definitely part of the ""Hollyweird"" group aren't you??I'm all-round just THANK everything that is holy, sacred, and beneficial that I didn't see this film when I was younger! 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies, but Pulp Fiction is certainly NOT one of them! It shouldn't have even been nominated for ANYTHING, not even Best Picture! IMO, ""The Lion King"" should've been nominated in it's place instead! A film that's all the more likable, fun, entertaining, relatable, family-friendly, and beautifully put together, it's ART! But guess not, since Hollyweird has got such a FETISH for pure violence, murder, sexual immorality, and biased anti-Christian propaganda.Pulp Fiction is just PAINFUL to sit through; Tarantino's a HACK! And I've never liked or will ever like any of his films!"
15 May 2019,Shishi17,1,1,9,I have no words!!!,"I literally had no words after I saw this movie so much was going on I had to wait a couple of minutes and process everything I just saw. This movie has action, suspense, murder, drugs, it had everything. I had to look away from certain scenes because it was so real, I think this is what made this movie great the reality. Whether it was the close up of someone shooting heroin or the long shot of the back and forth of the overdose scene. There was a couple of long shot scenes I thought was awesome. This movie is compelling and disturbing at the same time! Great movie and great acting. This movie is not for everyone but you cant deny the shots, the close ups, the acting, the script is awesome!"
18 February 2008,AdamG87,324,776,1,"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.","There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called ""style"". There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).The strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's really only a decent short film in all of this.The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated."
15 March 2021,shashanka_das,1,1,9,A great movie you can watch again and again,Because you'll probably be confused the first time around. It's not a coincidence it stars some of the greatest actors of our time.
29 July 2004,EijnarAmadeus,1,2,7,The definition of good movie? Maybe yeah.,"spoilers in this comment, probably.((( PULP FICTION is one of 1990ties movie highlights, and bringing the facts right to you; it's one of the cinema history's biggest highlights. Tarantino had already made RESERVOIR DOGS and achieved great reviews and were told that he would be the biggest director of this decade. Few years after that, he made PULP FICTION, a movie that settled with great cinematic power, how a good movie shall be. Tarantino got all these great actor/actresses into this very complicated and well made story and PULP FICTION was a defining movie. Vincent and Jules are hit men working for a negro crime boss named Marcellus Wallace. Marcellus is dealing with a boxer named Butch, Butch failed in Marcellus' mission to throw a fight after taking Marcellus' money and is planning to escape the city with his French maid, but simply can't leave a important object behind; his father's watch, that now off course belongs to him. In this time Marcellus' wife, Mia Wallace, is being taken care off by Vincent, who gets into problems when she sniffs his heavy drugs. And, in this there are a couple who's just started robbing a restaurant. AND - in Butch's escape he and Marcellus ends up kicking each other's butt in a local store, were it seems that the owner and some friends are crazy S&M rapists...and, there is a briefcase to be taken care off.The dialogs, music, acting and every freaking little thing works brutally well in this violent piece of movie making. Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames starring as the two men that's captured by these freaks down in a store-basement. Travolta and Jackson is simply amazing as the hit-man-couple who's both a pretty good friends but never really shares a joke. And all the small parts; Walken's small scene as Willis' father, Keitel as Mr. Wolf, Tarantino as pretty worried friend, Roth as the male robber and off course Uma Thurman's brilliant Mia Wallace. This movie is simply fantastic, genius AND pretty disturbingly well made! The best soundtrack of all time with Spansih guitars brutally going on as PULP FICTION appears on the screen as a big cahona on a plate. This is a movie not to be missed, although it may not be for the faint hearted, the movie delivers the goods so extremely well. It's brutality, use of fabulous words and genuine timing simply blown my mind pretty far away from any other movie. STARS: 5/5"
17 November 2015,edwagreen,2,8,6,**1/2,"You know that the several supposed unrelated stories are going to connect and some point and connect they do as the film reaches it climax.The stories of a gangster's wife, a boxer, two hit-men and others have a way of blending in at the end that actually makes sense.This is also a story of redemption and how a perceived miracle affected our story in a way that when a young couple take place, a character such as that of Samuel L. Jackson seeks redemption by handing over the loot to Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer during their bold restaurant robbery.It is also the story of a redeeming Bruce Willis who makes it out safely only to return to rescue leader Victor Rhames, who he had been shooting it out with when the two were captured by a white supremacy group ready to inflict severe pain on Rhames for being black.An interesting premise nicely done, but the film is overly violent and you really don't know in the end if all concerned have learned their lessons."
11 April 2021,CadeFilms,1,1,9,The Worst Parts Of Life Made Fun,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction takes all of the awful parts of our short lives, and embellishes them to seem outlandishly entertaining to watch. Murderous violence, drugs, sex, and every other disgusting thing that humans unfortunately feed off of, are utilized to craft an ironically enjoyable story that beautifully communicates this irony through its intense style. However, there are a few issues within the film that are frequently showcased throughout the early career of Tarantino. The editing, although flawlessly connecting a multitude of stories together, withholds a few distracting particulars. Right at the end of the film's first scene, there's a distracting transition that cuts off Yolanda's line after the frame becomes still. Furthermore, this same line is later altered during that couple's stand-off scene against Jules & Vincent. This ending scene to the film is also burdened by the same factor that Mr. Pink's escape sequence in Reservoir Dogs conjured, that of a lack of suspense. Earlier in the film, the audience was shown that Jules & Vincent make it out of the diner scene safe and sound. Therefore, the only suspense we're given within the movie's last sequence is that of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's possible deaths. Also, why does Vincent never hear ANYTHING when he goes to the restroom? Yes, the repetition of this factor throughout the film is hilarious. However, it makes no sense, especially when there are two people just outside literally screaming that they're going to shoot up the diner. Anyways, back to editing, Mia Wallace drew a rectangle instead of a square. What else can I say? It annoyed me that they purposefully edited in an incorrect addition to an actually funny line when they could have left out the actual ""square"" in the first place. Finally, there was an absolute perfect opportunity for a callback during the first Butch and Fabian scene when he ""sticks his tongue in the holiest of holies."" He should have given her a foot massage at the beginning of the scene! That would have been an incredible nod to the film's second conversation. Anyways, nothing actually awful hindered its incredible commentary, enjoyable performances, and stellar writing that connected dozens of characters together. This is a great film!94% or 9.4/10."
25 September 2014,diac228,1,2,10,Shot of adrenaline that lit up the film world of the 90s.,"Read this loud and clear: Pulp Fiction will never ever happen again. The impact, the delivery, the timing, and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated. See, there are bad movies, good movies, great movies, and trailblazers. The trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement, revolutionize the industry, change the landscape of motion pictures, and delivers an impact whether immediate (Star Wars) or down the road (Fight Club) that never exits the general consensus.Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Psycho, Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Graduate, and Goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers. None of these films have any contemporaries, they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them. Pulp Fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring, unexpected, stylish, and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed.Pulp Fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didn't know how to handle it. The soundtrack (among the best in film history), the unexpected blend of violence, drugs, and realistic dialogue, the surprises, the utter lack of chronological order, the style, the tone, and the overall look of Pulp Fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s, but everything preceding it. It talks like a Scorsese movie, moves like a 1950s Italian neorealism flick, paces like a spaghetti western, and breathes like an underground comic book come to life. Pulp Fiction is tasty cinematic soup.Pulp Fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did. Pulp Fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong, the story lines were unique, and there were so many details (explained and unexplained) that it required multiple viewings to catch it all, and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day. It was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman Quinten Tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the ""bad"" (Death Proof) and the good (Django Unchained).Everything in this movie works. The cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, AND Christopher Walken in one movie??!!). The dialogue was sharp, witty, brutal, and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga. The directing by Tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups, long shots, and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going.This movie literally has it all: sex, violence, drugs, rock n' roll, dancing, singing, crime, morality issues, romance, revenge, monologues, potential miracles, shootouts, dark humor, dozens of film references, and even a couple glimpses of the California underworld that most people would rather not know about. And all this was accomplished without a Hollywood budget. There was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge, like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry. This would inspire an entire wave of budding, ambitious, and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didn't want to cater to the typical Hollywood output or abide by its rules. Pulp Fiction is a B-Movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish.You can't duplicate this. I couldn't duplicate this. Tarantino could never duplicate this. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made, and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today. Pulp Fiction is as absolutely cool as its gets."

15 December 2016,KylePowell,1,1,10,Simply A Work of Art,"This movie first starts by boldly introducing two characters, in the 1950s a Jules (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) by jumping into their daily life. Starting off with no context towards their background, this film dumps you into a life of crime, murder, and drugs. As the plot progresses the film tells its story from the perspective of three different characters and completely engrosses you in its world. The intense need for violence in this movie is what drives us to the edge of our seats and keeps us there for the full length of the film.Quentin Tarantino used the aspect of different perspective to thoroughly encapsulate viewers and leave many in awe as they watch this film masterpiece. I will definitely be watching this again at some point so I can start all over."
3 July 2020,adambeare-77852,1,1,10,"Second time watching, I see the masterpiece.","The first time I watched this film, I couldn't enjoy it due to being confused and not being interested in the actors. However, recently after this I watched Saturday night fever and instantly became a huge John travolta fan, so I felt I should give pulp fiction another try and I'm so glad I did. I love the acting by Travolta and Bruce Willis especially, and the quotes by Samuel l Jackson are classic and Hilarious. I could tell the film had me hooked as I was shaking when Vincent gave Mia the adrenaline shot, because even though it's my second time watching, the acting's so good you feel that she might actually be dead. Though the order of the scenes can be confusing, it all makes sense when you watch the whole film as it all links together and keeps you interested as you don't know when the actual end is. A solid 10/10 watching the second time through."
5 May 2021,samuelgarcialopez,1,1,10,Perfect,"This film is perfectly done detail by detail, every minute is the same good experience of moviesthemselves.Personally one of my top 5 favourites.Tarantino´s genious format of movies with episodes adds to the plot."
30 March 2011,neil-476,2,9,7,At least the Emperor is wearing underpants,"Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece! No it isn't. It's over-rated. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's not as good as it's painted. And Tarantino's faults - which become more apparent with every (pretentiously) numbered subsequent movie - are all here on show.His dialogue is good - it's his main strength, and is correctly recognised as such. But a) it is over-reliant on the F-word (his CSI episodes and Inglourious Basterds show that he can write excellent dialogue without it), and b) it would greatly benefit from external editing: Tarantino badly needs a McCartney to sweeten his Lennon, a Lennon to apply an edge to his McCartney.His direction is good - he extracts brilliant performances from his ensemble, and his ability to present a truly eye-catching image on screen is beyond doubt. Action is good, effects are good, set design is good etc.But he comes in for undue praise for other things. Self-indulgence is one - again, he desperately needs someone to take him in hand and moderate some of what he does for the benefit of the film.Case in point - Pulp Fiction's non-linear storytelling. The zip-rewind halfway through is not some sudden work of genius. It may very well be experimental but, if so, it does not work as well as linear storytelling would have done (which, I suspect, would have involved more work in breaking the story threads into coherent sections which still worked together when interleaved, or else inserting flashbacks). Tarantino has taken an unconventional, but easy, road and, in so doing, has got away with it because of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" factor. However, it doesn't make Pulp Fiction a work of genius, it actually makes it a worse film.Tarantino's lack of self-discipline means that, despite his abundance of talent, his output continues to be over-rated."
7 April 2002,antondatree,1,1,10,Sheer brilliance,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest and most shockingly powerful films in history. Showing with realistic scenes and dialogue the underworld life in LA, Pulp Fiction shows what true brilliance is. The music is fantastic, the cast are fantastic, particuarly from Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, and Willis in his best role.I have watched Pulp Fiction many times, and it still makes me flinch when Jules holds up the gun at Brett (I think that's his name, he was played by Frank Whaley), while reciting the Bible passage, it still makes me sick when Mia Wallace does that thing (I won't say because the nice people at IMDb might consider it a spoiler, but its nothing sexual), and it still makes me laugh with the conversations between Jules and Vincent (aka: the foot massage thing, eating bacon).Tarantino, as he had with Reservoir Dogs, has showed what film brilliance is."
15 May 2019,morrjack,1,1,10,Another one to my list,"Absolutely loved this movie, one of my favorites, between the all star cast, great soundtrack, and multiple intertwining stories, this is really a film to remember. Director Quentin Tarantino leads us through story of gang members, Robbers, and a boxer all for a mysterious brief case, that we have no idea what it contains. Super fun movie, would watch it again."
7 February 2011,ElMaruecan82,1,3,10,"The Nineties, one Masterpiece and a Mysterious Black Briefcase ...","Writing is an instinct Quentin certainly possesses, and with ""Pulp Fiction"", his second film, he made a sensational break-through entrance in the great directors' joint. His influence on movies in the late 90's and early 00's is indisputable and even after 16 years, the freshness and originality of ""Pulp Fiction"" never ceases to strike. The film is thrilling, entertaining and darkly amusing from the beginning to the ending. Indeed, ""Pulp Fiction"" is just one of these films where things reach such a level of whatever makes movies worth being admired; on the top of that : writing. This is what makes ""Pulp Fiction"" rhymes with perfection and what most defines the Tarantinesque style.Chapter 1. The Cannolis of the Nineties.Writing is the special ingredient. When characters talk in a Tarantino film, the subtlety is that it makes you think it has nothing to do with the plot, that it's totally irrelevant, when in fact it is totally irrelevant and random yet it serves the plot. One golden rule in screen writing is that what you put must be related to the story : Tarantino throws away this rule and still respects it. The discussion about the little differences and how they call hamburgers is mentioned again when Jules asks Brett about it and till now, Vega's ""Royale with Cheese"" still resonates as the Canolli's quote of the 90's. The foot massage discussion finds another relevancy as it helps to characterize Marcellus's sensitivity and electrify the whole interaction between Jules and Mia. The Gold watch story, makes Butch' burst of anger totally understandable when Fabienne admits she forgot it. There were 1000 ways to make us learn about the Gold watch story, Tarantino takes a legendary actor telling us with such conviction we don't know if we're supposed to laugh or take it seriously. Deeper than that, notice how the Divine Intervention that saves Jules and Vincent's asses, inspired different reactions and the one who decides not to retire will ultimately be killed. God seems to play with fate like Tarantino with plot devices. Notice how Jules' decision will save Ringo and Pumpkin and lead to an Ezekiel's bloodless recitation. And of course, the reappearance of the two robbers at the end of the film is another tribute to Quentin's creative trademark: non-linear narrative structure. Sure Quentin didn't invent that, but he transcended it, making it an element of entertainment and total unpredictability. We'll go back to unpredictability later.Chapter 2. From ""Misirlou"" to ""Surf Rider"" Music is one of the key qualities of Quentin Tarantino films. It's like a second casting, Quentin casts his music like he does for his female characters. What would have been this film without the dazzling ""Misirlou"" start, without ""Girl, You'll be a Woman"", and the iconic ""You Never Can Tell"" featuring one of the weirdest but most memorable and reenacted cinematic dance sequences. Quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from Pop Culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by Tarantino's selective instinct. The music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. Whenever I hear the shrill voice of Honey Bunny shouting "" last one of ya"" I immediately imagine ""Misirlou"" starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. But music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality  Chapter 3. Perfection : from Head to Foot.Tarantino is the goddamn casting fairy of them actors  no seriously, he has like a magic power, who else could have made Travolta resuscitating after his ""Look Who's Talking"" career? Who else could have made Samuel L. Jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? Who else could have convinced Ving Rhames to re-enacts Ned Beatty's deliverance? Oh, I should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine : from the hypnotic Uma Thurman, to the hysterical Yolanda, to the punky pierced Jody, from the sweet and tender Fabienne to the sensuous lips of Esmarelda Villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. And thanks, Mr. Tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism  Chapter 4. Black Humor and White TowelsUnpredictability relies on what I would call the little differences that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" a classic film. It has this thing in common with other masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"", where every single scene is a classic, from A to Zed. The meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, Mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the Coolidge vs. Hoover fight, Esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, Fabienne's oral wish, Fabienne's f sweet accent, Vincent's death, Marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, Zed and Maynard, the Gimp, Marcellus's medieval speech, Zed's demise, Marvin  now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming? Should we laugh? Yes, 'cause it's funny as hell. It was an accident, as if it was supposed to be an excuse. The whole movie and what follows is the ultimate proof that this film is a masterpiece of comedy; the whole ""Bonnie"" situation creates so many gags, including the memorable appearance of Winston Wolf. This part sacred ""Pulp Fiction"" as a great film; and the last minutes made it a classic.End of story. When Jules and Vincent leave the restaurant, with the ""Surf Rider"" song starting, you know your eyes have been watching something new and fresh, something that will change the face of movies for a bunch of years to come. Just for ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Tarantino deserves to be admitted in the directors writers' hall of fame."
9 February 2021,Jackblyth8,1,2,10,"Flawless, Absolutely Flawless","A hilarious, thrilling rollercoaster captured in essence by the incredible Quentin Tarantino; 'Pulp Fiction' sees an impressive cast bonding to create the perfect mural of all things entertaining. The comedy mingles with the seriousness of the film, reinforcing Tarantino's intention to make the film a comedy. Its structure and overall direction is exquisite, contrasting two different livelihoods and gradually advancing to their relevance. Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. The next day, Vincent purchases heroine from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up, then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he had agreed to escort while Marsellus was out of town. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenalin shot to her heart. Butch betrays Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a MAC-10 on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom, and Butch shoots him dead, leaving the gun inside. As Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus spots him by chance crossing the road. Butch crashes his car into Marsellus, leaving both of the men injured and dazed from the accident. After coming to, Marcellus takes a gun out and shoots at Butch, and then chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. Zed, a security guard, joins Maynard. Together, they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving ""the gimp"", a silent figure in a bondage suit, to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp with a punch. He is about to flee but decides to save Marsellus, returning with a katana from the pawnshop and kills Maynard. Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's motorbike, and they drive away. Earlier, after Vincent and Jules have killed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, but misses with every bullet. Afterwards, Jules and Vincent kill him. Jules professes their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. As Jules drives, Vincent accidentally shoots Brett's associate Marvin in the head, covering themselves and the car in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard. At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their ""miraculous"" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" hold up the restaurant. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase. Providing the unique cyclical structure of ending where we started, 'Pulp Fiction' is a hilarious creative spectacle. Its production and direction is impressive and credit to Tarantino for revitalising Travolta and Willis' acting career's - the director's cameo isn't too bad either. Possessing a fast-paced hurry, the film ensures its crime and action is accommodated at all times with jokes and humour, to take away the sense of seriousness. As viewers we are often greeted with a 'happy ending' but the diner scene is more meaningful, Samuel L. Jackson's character seemingly resents his life of brutality and violence, and is focused on reciting a biblical message. He allows the two lovers to leave free of charge or punishment, in fact paying them for their services, the unusual act sees Jules be the 'bigger person', the perfect ending to a film fuelled with extroverts."
12 July 2011,Petey-10,1,3,10,Pulp Fiction- a bloody masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994) shows us people you don't want to mess with.If you do, you will get burnt.A couple wants to rob a diner, but they face Sam L.Jackson's and John Travolta's guns.And Sam gives a speech taken from the bible before pulling the trigger on a man named Brett.Bruce Willis and Wing Rhames meet some redneck rapists, but those jerks face a bloody end, in which a sword is involved.In the lighter moments we see Travolta's twist section with Uma Thurman.And in the last shot, when John and Sam leave the diner, they put their guns in their shorts.There are a few star moments from Pulp Fiction.And then are those actors.Travolta and Jackson, what a pair they make as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield.Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer make a great pair as the diner couple, Ringo and Yolanda.Bruce Willis as the boxer Butch Coolidge, who kills a man inside the ring, gives one of the best performances of his career.Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros is very good as his girlfriend Fabienne.Ving Rhames is terrific as the gangster Marcellus Wallace.Thurman is superb as the gangster's wife Mia Wallace.Eric Stoltz is great as the drug dealer Lance.Rosanna Arquette as his wife Jody is great.Steve Buscemi is really something as the Buddy Holly impersonator.Christopher Walken doesn't have too much screen time as Captain Koons, but his performance is memorable.Harvey Keitel is truly amazing as Winston ""The Wolf"" Wolfe.Tarantino himself plays Jimmie Dimmick.This story is stylish, made in an unique way.It is ultra cool, certainly one of Tarantino's best.Even though it's about people whose lives are filled with violence, you also like these people in some weird, twisted way.And the way they talk, the dialogue they use is really something else.The movie won an Oscar for Best Writing (Tarantino, Roger Avary) and was nominated for several others.At Cannes Film Festival Tarantino got a Palme d'Or.And it got several other awards but I don't bother to mention them all.This is a movie you just can't miss.If you don't want to be a dork."
19 July 2005,au_law2001,1,2,9,"Fast paced, wacky, and cool!","One of the best films out there, and one of the films that made Quentin famous, Pulp Fiction is one of those films that are thrilling and clever, that it makes you want to see it again and again. Though, it is non linear and it is more of a character based movie, it remained solid and entertaining, you see that the criminals or assassins are more than just interesting and cool. The dance scene was kinda funny, it was good to see Travolta dancin again, though not from the way he used to, and I liked also the scene where they try to inject Uma's character, and when she got up, that was amazing. I liked also the segment of the watch, the one with Bruce Willis. When he bumped into Ving Rhames' character, that was cool, and I also liked how they got back at the cop and store owner, and I must say Sam Jackson's character was very strange, but still, he was great and convincing in his character. Definitely a must see for those who love fast paced movies, and those who love Quentin Tarantino's work."
7 March 2003,K-Slicer,1,2,10,Fiction was never this good,"One of the first movie trailers I ever remember really liking.  Thanks to that trailer and the pulse-pounding guitar riffs of the chosen song, I was immediately taken in.  I first saw this film four years after it's initial release and it still stays with me every time.  This movie isn't ""Resevoir Dogs"" but it's a classic nonetheless.""Pulp Fiction"" easily has ten things going for it (spoilers contained herein): (1) The dialogue is quotable and I still hear quotes from it. (2) The scene with the adrenaline shot is one that should never be duplicated. (3) Samuel L. Jackson rocked this movie.  This was the best performance of his career. (4) Harvey Keitel was best supporting performer.  He was the comic relief and he did very well at it. (5) Quentin Tarantino is a master writer and master director. (6) The interweaving and rather disturbing tales are told surprisingly well. (7) The film editing was unreal.  I think Memento took some ideas from this movie. (8) The imagery dealing with God and spirituality made me wonder for a good long time. (9) Several rather unknown people show up and make for some memorable performances (Burr Steers and Phil LaMarr were in the first third). (10) The movie had a certain cheese factor that made it all the better.  Ten reasons give a score of 10.Cheesy and well-written are clearly two contradictory elements and that is especially true in the medium of film.  Quentin Tarantino proved the world wrong with the release of this movie.  It really rules!  Here ends my rant!"
26 March 2014,barnabyrudge,1,3,10,"Remarkable second feature from Quentin Tarantino - a masterpiece of dialogue, style and sheer story-telling chutzpah.","For better or for worse, Pulp Fiction changed forever the cinematic landscape of its time, not to mention times thereafter. It was followed by a deluge of copycats and wannabes, none of which quite matched the staggering bravura of this film – we really are talking here about a movie which epitomises that old dictum ""the original and still the best"". In this nonlinear trilogy of gangland stories – stuffed to the brim with crackling dialogue, pop culture references, stylised gunplay and jet black humour – Quentin Tarantino delivers an audacious and endlessly watchable movie, at once rewriting and redefining the whole style of the crime genre.The first story deals with hit men Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) as they track down a briefcase full of 'something valuable', stolen from their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) by a group of young opportunists. Later that evening, against the advice of Jules, Vincent escorts Marcellus's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), on a dinner date which spirals out of control with almost tragic consequences. The second story follows down-at-heel boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) who has been bribed by Marcellus to throw a fight. Butch doesn't keep his end of the bargain, pummelling his opponent to death in the ring before making a hasty getaway. Later, Butch attempts to flee from the city but first needs to retrieve a family heirloom – a precious watch – from his apartment. His attempts to recover the watch set into motion a crazy chain of events involving rednecks, gimp masks and a samurai sword! The third and final thread jumps back in time and follows Jules and Vincent once more, this time showing how they make a thorough hash of bringing in one of the young dudes who attempted to steal Marcellus Wallace's fortune. With an unexpected corpse on their hands, they need help from 'cleaner' The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to mop up their little problem. And even then, their eventful day is far from over as, next, they inadvertently get caught up in an impromptu coffee shop heist masterminded by Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer).While the narrative structure of Pulp Fiction is devilishly clever, the plot itself doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. The plot merely provides a backdrop against which the characters can interact – the film generates infinite fascination in its rich yet random conversations, where the characters chat casually about things like foot massages, European fast food joints, classic TV shows, piercings and why pigs are filthy animals, plus much, much more. Whatever else you say about Tarantino, he's the best there is when it comes to writing terrific passages of dialogue – there's nothing in cinema quite like a Tarantino conversation. Choosing a favourite performance from the remarkable ensemble work is almost impossible; everyone is in dynamic form, though it is perhaps Jackson, as the bible-bashing, smart-mouthed hit-man Jules, who leaves the most lasting impression. His career post- Pulp Fiction has been, quite simply, a twenty year success story. There's an abundance of terrific individual scenes too – the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which Vincent saves Mia from a drug overdose; the clean-up of Marvin's corpse after being accidentally shot by Vincent; Christopher Walken's unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of Butch's gold watch It would take too long to list all of the film's many wonderful vignettes; let's just say it overflows with great moments. Different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. If Reservoir Dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in Tarantino, Pulp Fiction marks a quantum leap in style, control and story-telling bravado. It remains a brilliant film, only Tarantino's second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best."
9 January 2005,FrankBooth_DeLarge,1,2,10,"Wildly Original, Creative, And Entertaining.","Pulp Fiction is a very entertaining viewing experience. I've never seen a film as original as Pulp Fiction. The structure of the movie is so creative, that it's hard to stop watching once you've started. This film is one that is very well liked among people everywhere, but some people don't understand it. The film does happen out of chronological order, as you may already know. Being out of chronological order makes it a little bit hard to follow, but having certain things happen at the beginning makes the film more involving the whole way through. (this part contains spoilers) Pulp Fiction is set up in three stories. Stories 1 and 2 do happen in chronological order, but the opening scenes are actually a few clips of the third story, which chronologically happens before the first 2 stories. If that was too confusing, this part might analyze the movie a little bit better for you. In the opening scene we see a man and a woman in a diner talking, and then they start a hold up. Then it cuts away to the opening credits. After that we see 2 mafia hit-men, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L Jackson) going to an apartment where they are supposed to take care of a few guys who stole a brief case from the mob boss, Marsellus Wallace. After that scene is when the stories take place. The first story is about how Vincent is asked to look after Marsellus's wife. The second story is about how a boxer(Bruce Willis) cut a deal with Marsellus and is being pursued by Marsellus's hit men. The third story, which is briefly shown at the beginning, picks up after Vincent and Jules killed most of the men in the apartment, and they accidentally shot one guy in their car, so they try to cover it up before one of their associate's wives finds out about it. Basically, from what I got out of this movie, this is an anti crime type of story. Throughout the story, certain members of the mob experienced things that would never have happened if they weren't involved with crime. Pulp Fiction is a movie that everyone experiences differently. If you experienced it the way I did, it will be a film you'll never forget. Definitely worth viewing, a very unique type of viewing experience."
23 May 2010,rtomlinson0840,36,80,1,Overrated,"Overrated is an understatement. This movie is start to finish garbage. I though Reservoir Dogs was an OK movie, and I liked Inglourious Basterds a lot. I don't have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies (My all-time favorite is David Fincher's Fight Club), but this movie is just crap. I understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie ""revolutionized"" what was acceptable to do in movies, but that doesn't make it a good movie by any means.The acting as a whole was entirely sub-par. As usual, Samuel L. Jackson's acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting (a la ""Snakes on a Plane"") and contributed nothing positive to the movie. Same goes for John Travolta, whose acting was arguably worse than Jackson's. There's a significant unconvincing ""memorization"" tone to his lines. The only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all; once the movie became a cult classic, he became the marketable actor he once was.I already said I don't have a problem with movies that contain explicit language, but in Pulp Fiction, there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted, and I'm not sure for what effect. If you listen to Tarentino's lines (as Jimmy) and Jackson's lines (when they're cleaning out the car), I think these lines best exemplify the overkill I'm talking about.Another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable. I realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint- after all, how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable? However, I just felt like the over-glorification heroin use, among other aspects really turned me off. Also, usually movies that glorify or portray behavior/lifestyles similar to those depicted in Pulp Fiction have characters that are normal human beings. In this movie, every character is either a murderer, a gangster, a drug dealer, someone with a drug problem, an accomplice to a crime, or a rapist. I just don't see the redeeming social value here.If you like movies with quality acting, character development, any sort of plot, or a message that doesn't bash the Bible; chances are Pulp Fiction is not for you. The one thing that Tarentino got right was the title: Pulp Fiction; this movie is both ""cheaply produced art"" and ""fake."""
2 March 2008,walsh-22,1,2,10,My guilty pleasure,"I prefer Pulp Fiction to Reservoir Dogs. I find it to be the funniest out of the two. There are so many funny situations that has me in stitches and it mainly involves Vincent and Jules. The scenes I laugh the most at is when Vincent shoots Marvin accidentally in the head, Jules and Vincent cleaning the car after and when Vincent brings an o-ding Mia to Lance's house, that just has me in stitches every time.I loved the interaction between Jules and Vincent. I couldn't wait for the film to switch back to them because they had really good chemistry, they were so hilarious together and I just enjoyed their reactions to the situations they found themselves in throughout the movie. I like that again Quentin Tarantino shoots the film out of sequence because it means that John Travolta who is shot in the middle of the movie, is alive at the end.There are other story lines entined in the film- Ringo and Yolanda robbing the coffee shop, Mia and Vincent's date, Butch (a boxer) who is paid to take a dive but ends up killing his opponent and trying to keep one step ahead of Vincent and Jule's boss Marsellus Wallace but as I have said I am more interested in the scenes that feature Vincent and Jules.I can see why this film was the comeback vehicle for John Travolta as he is just brilliant in it and it never seems like he doesn't belong in the role, what I also like about his role is he is not afraid to send himself up which we see especially in the dance scene with Uma Thurman. I can't imagine anyone else in Samuel L. Jackson's part, he just makes it his own. The other actors who I feel make the film entertaining is Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz.Yes, it has violence, some people class it as racist, I really don't know, maybe I'm wrong but I get the impression he is not doing it to be racist but is showing a world that not anyone sees or thinks still exists. It might be ugly but at least it is honest in saying our world is not as perfect as we think and the subjects covered in the film are happening somewhere. I have respect for Quentin Tarantino for not copping out and not trying to soften the hard core subjects the film features such as drug use and murder. A very good job, Quentin."
16 August 2016,Tweekums,1,4,9,A slice of LA gangster life,"This film from Quentin Tarantino tells the intertwining stories of a couple of gangsters, their boss's wife, Mia, and a boxer who is meant to throw a fight. There is little in the way of plot; we just observe their lives for a few days. The two gangsters are Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield and they work for Marsellus Wallace; early on Vincent and Jules discuss an incident where Marsellus threw another man out of a fourth floor window for allegedly giving his wife a foot massage something that makes Vincent nervous as Marsellus has asked him to take Mia out for the night while he is out of town. The evening goes well until they get back to Mia's house and she overdoses on Vincent's heroin while he is in the bathroom. The second story follows Butch the boxer who rather than throwing a fight for Marsellus beats his opponent to death. He knows he has to get out of town but first he must return home to retrieve his watch that has been in the family for generation. This puts him in a dangerous place when he bumps into Marsellus. Finally we see events that took place earlier after Vincent accidentally shoots somebody in a car and he and Jules have to get some help from 'The Wolf'.As I said earlier this isn't about plot; that isn't to say nothing happens though quite the opposite. There is a decent amount of action; some of it sudden and shocking as well as great characters. It is these characters that the film is really about. The cast does a fine job; most notably John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson who are on top form as Vincent and Jules; Uma Thurman is also impressive as Mia Wallace as is Ving Rhames as her husband. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Butch and Harvey Keitel puts in a memorable performance as 'The Wolf'. The non-linear way the story is told isn't confusing; I rather liked how the opening and ending scenes were concerned with the same event and chronologically took place in the middle of the story. Quentin Tarantino's dialogue is realistic but cool; I liked how the characters talked about mundane things; it made them feel far more real than if they had only talked about things relevant to the plot as characters in most films do. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; it is gripping, full of great characters and dialogue and contains many unforgettable scenes it does however contain material that will offend many people; most notably a lot of swearing and liberal use of 'The N-Word' as well as some shocking moments."

                        ",Words Simply Cannot Do Justice To This Film,"Pulp Fiction is one of those films where I simply cannot put into words how great it is. The script is brilliant, the film is great despite being near 150 minutes and EVERY actor/actress plays a great part.I did find the film confusing the first time I saw it but after I had watched it everything made sense.Every character in the film has depth. Take John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They're not just playing a pair of emotionless hitmen like most films portray. They're real people with real feelings and real emotions. The same goes for Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace and Harvey Keitel as The Wolf. They are without a doubt the best characters ever in a film and I cannot praise them-and Quentin Tarantino-enough. As for Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, well I think this is the best ever role for the underrated Bruce Willis who is such an interesting character.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The scenes are great throughout. One scene I enjoyed was where Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace are at the mercy of a homosexual pawn shop owner and his twisted friend Zed (and some freak called the Gimp). It was a bit of an uneasy scene to watch but the reason I enjoyed it was because Butch Coolidge came back to save Marsellus Wallace who was at the mercy of homosexual rapist Zed. Moments earlier Butch and Marsellus had been enemies but Butch rushed back and probably saved Marsellus's life. I found that quite interesting. In my opinion it showed us that there may be honour even among thieves.Of course, there are many other great scenes too numerous to mention. Pulp Fiction opens with a bang and finishes with a bang. Anybody who hasn't seen the film is strongly advised by me to get the video or DVD as soon as possible.Brilliant masterpiece! Well done to all those involved in it!"
9 June 2020,l-64317-97959,1,1,10,We are all the same,"It was a very good film, with a very unique style, perhaps the first of its kind in that era. Most tragically of all, the reverse X is surrounded by x-men, revelling and screaming. Maybe Quentin would laugh bitterly and curse the F **kers."
15 November 1999,baumer,1,3,10,Take 'im down to the kennel and sick the dogs on and we'll find out what he knows!,"Warning: does contain spoilers.Before I go into how great this film is, I have to first tell you something that I know everyone thinks but so few have commented on, and that is the performance of Ving Rhames.  For those of you that have seen this film, you all know what I am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that haven't, if you ever see a film for a singular performance, see two films. One is Tombstone because of Val Kilmer and the other is Pulp Fiction for Rhames.  His portrayal of Marcellus Wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures.  His mannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, even over Samuel Jackson.  Just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of his facial expressions.  This is the epitome of greatness and if I could pick 5 performances in the history of film that are the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. Just look at the scene when Jules talks to him after the Marvin problem. Jules is freaking out and Wallace calmly responds "" I'm on the m*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, I'm sending in tha Wolf. ""  As he delivers the line he is serenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an expensive hanky.  His delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you don't think this is a ruthless killer, he is just a guy next door with a very nice house.  And what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about alleviating the Bonnie situation before she gets home.  These are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of killing people and they are attempting to save a man's marriage by removing a dead body from the garage.  That is just dripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by Rhames. Another scene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene.  When he finally gets around to his comeuppance against "" Billy Boy "", he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are actually worried for Zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation.  And then when he talks to Butch, he is fair and thankful for Butch's assistance but cannot forget how Butch betrayed him.  "" Oh that what now.  I'll tell you what now.  There is no me and you.  You leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone.  You lost all your L.A. privledges. ""  Ving Rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously intelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the film.  I think Tarantino is so smart for casting Rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing that Rhames is one of the most humble men in Hollywood, remember when he gave back his Emmy to Jack Lemmon as he tearfully said that he hadn't paid enough dues yet and Lemmon was one of his idols?  The man can do no wrong in my eyes.  He is one of a kind.As for the rest of Pulp Fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated.  That is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. It is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so original and so great is simply the writing.  What other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the importance of them just before they are about to perform a hit.  What other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under Jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I can understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best Picture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have Christopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the Earth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 8:00 AM and then appear on the scene to ""solve problems"" have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and ""pop a cap"" in someone's ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it all make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some Hollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films ever made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film."
26 January 2005,miken-3,1,2,9,Different but great!,"Anyone who has seen the Kill Bill movies can understand Tarrantino's style. This one has a series of stories, some of them related and most of them with John Travolta. One of my favorites involves Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who shoot a guy in their car. They need to clean themselves up and get rid of the ""mess."" Enter Harvey Keitel as a take charge kind of guy who approaches the problem like a swat team giving everybody orders of what to do, how to do it, and how long each step will take.Another tale involves Bruce Willis trying to guard a watch that was handed down from his grandfather to his father and then preserved by his father's friend (Christopher Walken) in his rectum during internment at a POW camp. Willis trying to get the watch back gets into a big fight with a crime boss and while they are fighting they are captured by sex fiends for torturous games.The movie breaks all rules and like Blue Velvet, is like no other movie I have seen before. I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it."
9 September 2005,chtfj21,7,18,3,Boooring,"Three things I hated about this movie:1) The pointless and irritating dialogues - ""in France they call it Royal"". Yes, so McDonald's has different names for the quarter pounder in different countries. Great. Am I as a viewer supposed to find this fact surprising? or witty? or ""cool""? or what? In fact, the whole conversation about McDonald's was just dead boring. As were the conversations about drugs. ""Whos's motorbike is this? - It's not a motorbike, it's a scooter"" just made me want to punch that pedantic cretin.2) The gimp. Quentin Tarantino's prejudices aren't doing any favours to reputation the BDSM and gay communities. Most people who are into bondage aren't sickos, and I think propagating myths about BDSM is irresponsible. Oh, and of course, black people aren't into fetish. Ever. Everyone knows that, right?3) The dance. Not making any effort and just not generally giving a toss won't earn you a prize in real life."
21 May 2010,zardoz-13,1,4,10,Brilliant!,"Writer and director Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994, and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film. This crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men, a treacherous boxer, a cocaine-snorting drug dealer's wife, and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore. If Tarantino had not made any other movie, he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with ""Pulp Fiction."" He juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society, whether they be murderers, thieves, narcotics dealers, sexual perverts, or small-time, pistol-wielding crooks. ""Pulp Fiction"" defies chronological time because Tarantino stages everything out of order. This fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order. Not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull. Ultimately, Tarantino and co-scenarist Roger Avary received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Tarantino for Best Director, the film itself for Best Picture, John Travolta for Best Actor, Sally Menke for Best Editing, and Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman respectively for Best Supporting Male and Female roles. Over ten years later ""Pulp Fiction"" is still outstanding, largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem. Tarantino's quotable dialogue, his articulate underworld thugs, and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity. Inspite of the scrambled up stories, Tarantino plots everything very carefully, foreshadowing situations and predicaments, with characters facing the consequences of their actions. Tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers, but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece.""Pulp Fiction"" opens in a restaurant with Ringo/Pumpkin (Tim Roth of ""Reservoir Dogs"") discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend Yolanda/Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer of ""The Prophecy"")and their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant. Colorful credits follow and Tarantino introduces us to Jules (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Shaft"") and Vincent (John Travolta of ""Saturday Night Fever"") as Vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in Amsterdam. A quarter-pounder is called a Royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system. They arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attaché case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south. Jules questions Brett (Frank Whaley of ""The Doors"") about the guy's questionable business practices with Jules' boss Marsellus Wallace. All the dumbfounded Brett can utter after he witnesses Jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word ""What?"" Jules warns him not to say ""what"" again. Nevertheless, Brett says ""What"" five times and Jules puts a bullet in his shoulder. Vincent and Jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase, but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a ""cannon"" like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them. The guy misses each time and Jules and Vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander, Marvin (Phil LaMarr of ""Old Dogs"") after they kill Brett."
2 June 2009,tjsdshpnd,1,2,9,Watched Cinematic History Being Created,"The very beginning of the movie showcases the dictionary meaning of the word 'Pulp'. The rest that follows is a 2 hour experience of a masterpiece, a classic cinematic experience. Pulp Fiction can be said to have redefined a genre. The basic plot is about two hit men, their Boss Marselus, Marselus's wife Mia, a boxer and two small time thieves and how their lives inter-relate. The movie is divided into many sections or chapters which brings out the different stories one by one. Tarantino and his unique, intelligent style of story-telling is seen in its brightest form in this movie. F*** and Sh** are the two most commonly used slang's throughout the movie. But a special mention to the dialogues of the movie. They help a lot in establishing the characters .About Acting, Travolta is probably one of the most stylish and charismatic actors of Hollywood. That is evident in this movie as well. His dancing skills are also put to task and he charms once again. Uma Thurman is a livewire in her short role. Bruce Willis has done a convincing job. Samuel.L.Jackson surprised me a lot, great actor who is very much under-rated. Pulp Fiction is surely not to be missed for even the newbie Hollywood fansRating : 9/10"
6 November 2007,98nurdinm-1,1,2,7,"""Pulp Fiction""","Given the opportunity to get this on a cheap DVD, I decided to seize the day as it were and find out what all the fuss was about. Having only seen one Tarantino film - ""Kill Bill: Part One"", which I suppose actually means I'd only seen half a Taraniton film - and having enjoyed it a lot, plus having read and heard all the hype surrounding ""Pulp Fiction"", my expectations were higher than I would say they usually are before watching a film.For the majority of it, ""Pulp Fiction"" does exactly what I've been led to believe it does: confuses you and thrills you, as well as making you chuckle, albeit a little guiltily, at several points.The story itself - not told in a linear style - can at times be frustratingly annoying in its light-pretentious way of saying, ""Ooh, look at me, I'm non-linear, I'm going to muck about with your heads"". It is also full of coincidences, especially the story which revolves around Bruce Willis's character. This particular strand goes off into extremely weird territory. I suppose parts of it could happen, but you'd have to be very, very unlucky for it to actually be the case.The cast are pretty much impeccable. Despite the very good performance of John Travolta, the film's early scenes really belong to Samuel L Jackson, whose rehearsed Biblical scripture sounds at first rather absurd before becoming incredibly chilling. There are nice turns from Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames before the film is once again saved by Jackson. Harvey Keitel is also bwa-ha-ha funny, thankfully good enough to overshadow the rather poor performance of Tarantino himself.One thing that does rock in this film is the soundtrack, from the opening familiar theme which suddenly changes halfway through into a completely different piece of music, to the final end guitar strains. The stand-out piece must be the Chuck Barry song which Travolta and Thurman dance the twist rather badly to. This is a moment so surreal that you're not sure whether to laugh or just scratch your head and ponder the meaning of life.On the whole, ""Pulp Fiction"" deserves most of the plaudits it has gained, and it is (or was) original enough to justify winning the Palme D'Or at Cannes 1995. But it is not a really great film. I have a feeling that we're still waiting for Tarantino to make one of those. Unless he already has, and I just haven't watched it yet.7/10"
21 May 2005,tomimt,1,3,9,A movie deserving its name,"Quentin Tarantion's Pulp Fiction is a movie containing several stories which cross each other in one point or another.Vincent Vega (John Travolta in his comeback role) is an assassin, who has just returned from Europe. He and his associate Jules (always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson) are doing a gig for their boss Marsellus (Ving Rhames). They gotta get back a briefcase, containing something precious.Mia (uma Thurman)is a girlfriend of Marsellus, who is trusted in the care of Vincent in her night out.Butch (Bruce Wills perhaps in one of his best roles) is an aging prize fighter, who has to make his one, last big fight.And Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and pumpkin (Tim Roth) are just two petty robbers, who are about to rob a café.All these stories cut each other in someplace of the film, so it all isn't as random as it might sound like.Dialogue is the key to this film: Tarantino has managed to write conversations about such common thing as giving someone a foot rub, making it interesting and full of views you wouldn't normally think of.But there is more than just dialogue: there's action and some drama and situations, which are so surprising and sudden that you just don't see them coming until they hit you in the face.This all is perfected with good direction and great musical choices.And before I end this rant, I wanted to share my favourite moment with you: Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) gives Butch his family heirloom, left him by his father, who was, and died, in the same Vietcong prison camp Koons was.Top notch film."
17 March 2005,jboothmillard,2,14,10,Pulp Fiction,"I think the title of the film relates to foreign New Wave film, and magazines, well the film starts with the definitions. Anyway, this is a brilliant crime drama from Oscar winning writer (along with Roger Avary) and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino. The story begins with what will be a continuing scene towards the end where Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) plan the robbery of the cafeteria they are in. After the opening credits, with the song ""Jungle Boogie"" we see hit men Vincent Vega (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Samuel L. Jackson) on their way to see one of their boss's associate's to retrieve the stolen valuable briefcase (we never see what it is, but from the reflecting colour it looks like gold), asking questions about their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and after Jules popular bible passage recitation killing two of the double-crossers. It then skips to Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who is paid to throw a boxing match, and Vincent comes in, leading to another story. Vincent is taking Marcellus's wife Mia (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman) for the evening, in which they win a dance contest, she snorts what she thought was cocaine, but it was heroin, and she is revived with adrenalin at the house of drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz). It then flashes back to (what would be the opening of the film) young Butch receiving his father's watch from Capt. Koons (Christopher Walken) who tells him they both shoved it up their arses to keep it safe. Then it forwards to Butch's fight, and he did not throw it, and he escapes the city, there is a moment where Butch has to go back to his house when his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria De Medeiros) forgot his watch, and he kills Vincent who was waiting for him. Driving back though, he also encounters Marcellus himself, but before they can kill each other, they are kidnapped and tied up by two homosexuals, one is Zed (The Mask's Peter Greene). Butch manages to escape and save Marcellus from continued torture and male rape, and this is when their dept is settled, as long as Butch leaves town for good. The final flashback goes back to just after Jules has killed Lance, and another guy from the cupboard comes out shooting, but no bullets hit. After killing him, and taking Marvin (Phil LaMarr) with them, they have another problem where Vincent accidentally shoots their hostage. To help clear up the mess they go to the house of Jimmie Dimmick (Tarantino) and call for help from the guy who can ""solve problems"", Winston 'The Wolf' Wolfe (Harvey Keitel). They manage to clear up the mess, and have to wear new, dorky clothes, and going to a cafeteria everything seems fine, till Pumpkin and Honeybunny start the robbery (that you saw at the beginning), and eventually after a long chat and guns pointing Jules and Vincent stop them, before leaving, and that is the end. Phew! I would have explained it all in the chronological order, but that would be complicated for those who don't know it. Also starring Rosanna Arquette as Jody and Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly. Tarantino's direction and script, where characters seem normal, e.g. talking about popular culture (like burgers) is brilliant, all actors are perfectly cast, and it is just an unmissable mainstream film. The memorable quotes, besides Jules's bible recitation, ""Bring out the Gimp"" and ""They call it a ""Royale with Cheese""."" (both nominated to be in 100 Years, 100 Quotes), are ""Zed's dead baby. Zed's dead."" and ""Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face"" - ""Why the f*** d'you do that!"" Oh. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Uma Thurman was number 95, Harvey Keitel number 53, John Travolta number 46, Bruce Willis number 35, and Samuel L. Jackson number 11 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Travolta was number 38, and Thurman number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Travolta was also number 63 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 46 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, the film was number 15 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"
15 January 2003,Anonymous_Maxine,1,4,10,Another shockingly good film from Quentin Tarantino.,"**SPOILERS**Tarantino has one of the most recognizable styles of any director working today, and Pulp Fiction is considered by many to be his greatest work yet. It is a conglomeration of Tarantino's own infatuation with the movies, as it is more about movie life than real life. One of the few little factoids that I know about Tarantino is that, like myself, he spent some time working in a video store and, like myself, spent a lot of his time watching old action films and horror films and pulp fiction films. Pulp Fiction is about the things that are in movies like that rather than real life. We have a lot of people put into extraordinary situations that do not have a lot of parallels with reality, but they are so well written and presented that we are more than willing to overlook this.One of my favorite things about Pulp Fiction is the way it presents several different storylines and mixes up the chronology of the film, which enormously increases the re-watch value. The film starts off with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer playing a married couple who decide to rob a diner in broad daylight. The opening credits begin just as they stand up and bring out their guns, and we don't go back to this diner until more than an hour later in the film, when Vincent and Jules (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, both in possibly the greatest roles of their entire careers) finally show up after going through some serious situations of their own.Bruce Willis stars as a boxer who was supposed to go down in a big fight but killed his opponent instead, and now the bookies are after him. His absolutely adorable girlfriend, played by Maria de Medeiros, plays the part of the significant other who just doesn't understand Butch's (Willis) urgent need to leave, like right this second. This leads to some interesting situations where Butch is stuck trying to hurry her out of the house and calm her down at the same time, and we as the audience are stuck wishing that she would shut up and get the hell out of the house while at the same time wishing there was some way she could be made to feel better.
One of the biggest strengths of the film is the way the stories are all tied together. Vince and Jules, for example, after paying a visit to some guys who screwed their employer, take one of them hostage, only to have Vince accidentally shoot him in the face while asking him a casual question in the car. They take the bloodied car to their friend Jimmie's (Tarantino) house, and go through one of the more amusing scenes in the film trying to get the car clean before Jimmie's wife comes home, finds a bunch a gangsters in her house doing a bunch of gangster sh*t, and divorces Jimmie. Tarantino, as has become a tradition of his, plays one of the best roles (although also one of the smallest, which is also common) in the film, as a normal guy who just wants to live a normal life without people showing up at his house at 8 in the morning with a bloody car and a dead body.Harvey Keitel shows up playing the role of The Wolf, and does his job of cleaning up messes like the one Vince and Jules have on their hands (and their clothes, and their car). Here is a guy that knows exactly what he's doing, and he works quickly and efficiently and hates to be slowed down by people who prefer politeness (`Pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the f**kin' car.'). Eventually it gets clean, the mess is solved, and in order to clear their minds (and so Jules can continue to contemplate the miracle that saved them from being shot by a guy who burst out of a closet and emptied his gun into the wall behind them at point blank range), they go to a diner to get some breakfast - the same diner that Ringo and Yolanda were robbing in the opening scene of the film. Everything that has taken place up to this point in the movie, except for the robbery itself, took place before the robbery, and now we're right back where we started.(spoilers) It takes a few viewings to really get this movie straight because it is so complex and intricate, but I'm pretty sure there are something like four or five different stories operating at the same time, and it becomes even harder to get straight because some of them mix in with other ones. Butch has to make a desperate trip back to his apartment to retrieve a wristwatch that has more than a little bit of sentimental value, and when he gets there, he finds Vincent there, once more taking on a job that's just a little over his head. Not only is this guy not able to travel with someone in the back seat without shooting him in the face, but he also seems to have a hard time staking out someone's apartment without using the bathroom and leaving his machine gun on the kitchen counter. Not the smartest character, but certainly one of the most likable that Travolta has ever played.
In Pulp Fiction, the characters are not given dialogue that is meant only to further the plot. In many instances, it is there literally for no other reason than to show them having casual dialogue which often has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Jules and Vincent discuss at length the names of burgers at McDonalds' in France, the definition of a miracle, and the acceptable difference between a woman's foot and her holiest of holies. Granted, at least two of these have direct meaning to the plot, but when you see how deeply into the subjects Vince and Jules go, it becomes more and more clear that they are talking just to be talking. But the thing that really brings out the quality of the script is that no matter how long anyone goes on about one subject, it never once gets boring.All of the actors involved deliver some of the best performances of their careers, and much of the reason for this is because the roles fit them perfectly and the script is written so well. It's full of drugs, violence, blood, crime, murder, sex, and guns, but never once even approaches anything gratuitous. Things like this are very often condemned by our society, and with good reason, if they are thrown into a movie just to advance a weak story, but in Pulp Fiction there is nothing thrown in without reason and nothing that is put in to make up for weakness anywhere else. But while it does have good reason to have everything in it that's there, the film is certainly not for everyone, because even the most logically placed violence and blood and killing is going to be hard for some viewers to take, so you should be forewarned. But the rest of you, as they say, are going to love it."
29 January 2008,gcd70,1,4,8,What a rush!,"Quentin Tarantino is a cinematic genius! If you don't believe me just treat yourself to his fantastic ""Pulp Fiction"", a dark, sharp, black as black comedy thriller concerning a few days in the lives of some desperate LA characters.Our prodigious director co-wrote the script (with Roger Avary), which contains some absolutely brilliant dialogue. This supreme black comedy has such a distinct laconic wit that you'll find yourself breaking up at the most gruesome and disturbing of scenes. The film's thriller element is at times chillingly effective, creating with ease heart pounding tension that will have you fidgeting in your seat and drying your hands on the legs of your trousers.The story itself, or three stories in one actually, is a fascinating tale of double-cross which will completely involve you, as will the equally fascinating character study which lies within the intriguing plot. There are some amazing people in ""Fiction""! The total un-predictability of the movie works to perfection, as Tarantino controls and manipulates his audience whilst entertaining brilliantly throughout. He deliberately unsettles us early so that we're never comfortable, then draws us in effortlessly as the narrative unfolds. The finale is very satisfying (more than so), yet leaves you itching and pleading for an encore. This is highly addictive cinema! You never know who's gonna do what to whom, where the next sucker punch is coming from nor the next razor sharp line.The bold format works excellently, with the non-chronological sequence being a real plus. Apparently the original concept was to have the script 'linear', but the fact that this removed some main characters early in the piece was found to be unsatisfactory, and so a re-write was ordered. The result is astonishingly effective, and the editing is truly inspired, maintaining the ideal pace.Tarantino's film is graphically violent yet superbly visual, containing some startling cinematography and much effective imagery, including one particular hard drug scene that leaves a marked impression.Finally, one of the film's strongest points is the powerful acting. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth are first on the scene giving us two great performances as the picture's initial desperate criminals. As a hippie drug dealer and his severely body-pierced wife, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette both make solid impressions, as do Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself. In the more pivotal roles are Bruce Willis as reckless boxer Butch, Ving Rhames as crime-lord Marsellus Wallace, Uma Thurman as the sexy drug-fiend Mrs. Wallace and John Travolta as Marsellus' Italian hit man Vincent Vega. All give strong showings. Frank Whaley and Christopher Walken also drop in on the action, but the plum role goes to Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winfield. Jackson gets all the very best lines and the most interesting character by far, and his performance is sensational, worthy of acknowledgment at the highest level.I could go on and on about what I consider to be the film of 1994 by a long shot. Quentin Tarantino will have you eating out of the palm of his hand. Even though the black comedy gangster thriller is a well worn genre, the movie's amazing originality will blow you out of the theatre, while its confronting and astounding style and layout will really keep you thinking. What a rush!Sunday, December 11, 1994 - Knox District CentreFriday, February 10, 1995 - Village Centre MelbourneMonday, February 27, 1995 - Kuhio Twins HonoluluHaving seen Tarantino's violent, graphic landmark ""Pulp Fiction"" four times, I must confess that even though it is a remarkable piece of story telling, it does tend to wear a little thin.Without the surprise element with which he so easily manipulates his audience first time around, Tarantino must rely on the depth and genius of his writing, and the shrewdness of his direction and the editing. In this light ""Pulp Fiction"" does tend to be over long and perhaps over indulgent, and may have even worked just as well in chronological order (haven't I changed my tune).On the other hand, all the outstanding performances certainly hold up to repeat viewings. As the thinking man's gangster, Samuel L. Jackson delivers a veritable tour-de-force in what is possibly the performance of 1994. John Travolta's showing is stylish and controlled, Uma Thurman proves herself to be a real handful, overdosing or otherwise, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are both ideally cast and make the very most of their characters, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth (Honeybunny and Pumpkin) are incredible in their small roles (you could make a movie spin-off based on those two!), Christopher Walken's walk in is significant but rather drawn out, and both Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are terrific as the young marrieds selling and doing drugs (every scene of theirs is extremely funny).One may conclude that ""Pulp Fiction"" could have been just as effective twenty minutes shorter, but who's complaining. The film is ultra-violent, so the squeamish should avoid it, as should those who don't enjoy contemplative, thought provoking cinema. Movie goers really need to be alert to put all the pieces together, and also to appreciate all the philosophical dialogue from Jules and Vincent. Most will find Tarantino's small talk both ingenious and amazingly true to life, as well as incredibly hilarious.Sunday, July 9, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema"
17 February 2021,patches89,1,3,10,SAY WHAT AGAIN!!,"This is a brilliant film, a classic or a masterpiece even. Quentin Tarantino has the flare for writing specific characters and an old school way of writing his stories and the magic is there in spades here. A large chunk of the film follows Jules (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) the trusted hitmen of Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) who goes out with Vincent, boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) who double crosses Marsellus and the Wolf (Harvey Keitel) who fixes a problem jules, Vincent and Jimmie (Tarantino) has. The film starts and ends with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) as the try to rob a restaurant. Its impossible to describe the whole film without doing it justice but everyone played their characters amazingly to go along with how brilliantly made it was"

                        ",A cinematic Masterpiece Commerating on its Tenth Anniversary,"Contains SpoilersThe Tenth Anniversary of a cinematic Classic!!!Released in 1994 with its witty,stylish and romantic to its dark heart,PULP FICTION is a compulsively funny and strangely dreamy look at the criminals,hangers-on,and low life scum who populate a glamorously sleazy Los Angeles of the mind. The movie's opening scene is in a diner,where none-too bright criminal lovebirds Honey Bunny(Amanda Plummer)and Pumpkin(Tim Roth)discuss their future. They're tired of holding up liquor stores and 7/11's:too many shopkeepers with too many guns They decide to switch to diners,in broad daylight,which are full of people with wallets and purses. The pre-credits sequence ends as Honey Bunny leaps up,gun in hand,and shouts that it's a stick-up. The next sequence begins in a car,as hit men Jules(Samuel Jackson)and Vincent Vega(John Travolta),who's just returned from an extended stay in Europe,talks about everything under the sun-at least,and everything that interests them,from what a Quarter Pounder is called in France to TV Pilots. They're on their way to pay a visit to three clean-cut,middle class youths who've make the mistake of double crossing their boss,Marsellus. Jules is especially interested in the fact that Vincent has been assigned to escort Marsellus' wife Mia while the big man is out of town;there are pitfalls inherent in spending time with the boss's wife. Their visit with the college boys takes a nasty turn for the worst after they briefcase-which emits a strange,radiant light-that Marsellus has sent them to retrieve. This is where Jackson quotes a part from the Bible(and it is one of the best performances throughout the film)before the entourage of taking out the youths.We see next Vincent on his way to keep his date with Mia(Uma Thurman). He stops off to visit his dealer,Lance(Eric Stoltz),buys some heroin,and shoots up before arriving at Marsellus' home. Vincent and Mia have dinner at Jackrabbit Slim's,a 1950s theme restaurant,then Vincent takes her home. While he is in the bathroom,she discovers the heroin in his pocket,mistakes it for cocaine and snorts some. When he comes out,she's comatose:in a panic,he takes her to Lance's where they administer a shot of adrenaline to the heart. She recovers,and the evening ends with Mia and Vincent promising that the events will be their secret. In the next sequence,we meet Butch(Bruce Willis),a washed up boxer who is being paid for by Marsellus(Ving Rhames) to takes a dive in a upcoming fight,but Butch has other plans--who then flees with his girlfriend Fabianne(Maria de Medeirous) and get out of the country. The next morning he learns that Fabianne has forgotten the watch he inherited from his father who fought in the war(Christopher Walken),and goes back to the apartment to retrieve it,but instead finds the watch,and then driving back to his girlfriend,Butch runs down Marsellus,who tries to kill him,and from there Marsellus chases Butch into a pawnshop when turns out to be sadistic hillbilly sex murderers which Butch escapes while they're assaulting Marsellus,but his sense of honor makes him goes back and kills the sadistic suckers in a bloody outburst of gore,and from there Marsellus forgives him but tells Butch to leave town and he and his girlfriend ride off into the sunset.The final sequence returns to Jules and Vincent's dilemma where they killed off the young victims,but a fourth one lives. In the car Jules claims that they were saved by a miracle,but while they're driving and talking,Vincent accidentally shoots the passenger,and they find somewhere to hide out while they clean up there gore-splattered car full of bone fragments. They descend on Jimmy(Quentin Tarantino),a close friend of Jules,but they have to be out before Jimmy's wife returns. However,Marsellus sends The Wolf(Harvey Keitel)to get them out of their situation and from after their taxing morning,Jules and Vincent decide to have breakfast in the same diner that Honey Bunny and Pumpkin and about to rob. As customers hit the floor,Jules remains calm while Vincent is in the diner's restroom. He refuses to give up the briefcase,overpowers Pumpkin,talks Honey Bunny out of opening fire,and eventually defuses the whole situation. At the end,Vincent and Jules leave the diner,still talking about Jules' plans to devote himself over to God.On the commemoration of its tenth anniversary,PULP FICTION is a witty,violent and unexpectedly redemptive tour de force,in which he juggles three overlapping stories of love,betrayal,and murder as business-as-usual. The movie skims along on a sea of lurid clichés,but are as twisted,transfigured,and given astonishingly fresh-life to its cast of characters as the day this film was released. PULP FICTION also pays homage to its B-movie past while existing comfortably it is own perfectly realized world. It also pays great homage to the action-packed blaxploitation films of its era and the crime-noirs thrillers of the 1970's which set the tone for the other Quentin Tarantino films like RESERVOIR DOGS(1992),JACKIE BROWN(1997),and most recently the KILL BILL(2003,2004) trilogies. Oscar-Winner for Best Original Screenplay(Quentin Tarantino),and Oscar nominations for Best Picture,Best Director,and so forth,PULP FICTION is a cinematic masterpiece of film especially with all the violent action-and there's plenty with some of its explicit graphic in detail is very paramount indeed. Check the extended DVD version as well. Congradulations,Quentin Tarantino on your 10th Anniversary of this landmark classic."
16 February 2021,RoBiN_SinGH211221,1,2,10,This is a really Tarantino's Masterpiece.,"Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but they have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match.The next day, Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he had agreed to escort while Marsellus was out of town. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenaline shot to her heart.Butch betrays Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a MAC-10 on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom and is killed by Butch, who departs and leaves the gun behind.As Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus happens to spot him. Butch crashes his car into Marsellus, leaving both of the men injured and dazed. After coming to, Marcellus takes a gun out, shoots at Butch, and chases him into a pawnshop. Butch gains the upper hand and points the gun at Marsellus, but the owner, Maynard, captures them both at gunpoint and binds and gags them both in the basement. Zed, a security guard, joins Maynard. Together, they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving ""the gimp"", a silent figure in a bondage suit, to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. Instead of fleeing, he decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who uses Maynard's shotgun to shoot Zed in the crotch. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper, and they drive away.Earlier, after Vincent and Jules have killed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, but misses with every bullet; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving away from the scene through the San Fernando Valley with Brett's associate Marvin, Jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the head, covering themselves and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard.At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their ""miraculous"" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" hold up the restaurant and demand Jules' briefcase. Distracting him with its contents, Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him and Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand.
My Rating: 10/10"
8 April 2010,cool_cat_cody,53,130,1,Pulp Fiction should be removed from society,"Don't get me wrong i generally like gory mature movies. But, this movie was terrible; repulsive fast paste griddy storyline with no plot is not my idea of a good movie. It was simply a bunch of unpleasant scenes put together sporadically in a timeline sequence until the end of the movie came. And you come to realize the moral, doing bad things isn't good for you, also the most elementary concept one knows. The only one that makes it out unscathed is Samuel L. Jacksons part. And i believe this is wholly because he abandoned the path of immorality. Teaching us what is commonly known through a disgusting and unorganized movie.Nothing at all embracive, enthusing, funny, witty, or intelligible. I mean their were themes, but they were incredibly dull and boarish. I am blind to how people see this as a good movie. I found this movie as a waste of life."
13 August 2010,tbills2,1,4,10,A classic. Pulp Fiction.,"This movie is so cool. It is the coolest. No movie's got style like Pulp Fiction. The writing/dialogue is simply genius. Quentin Tarantino raised the bar with this film, actually, he took the bar and threw it through the roof. There certainly was never anything like it before, and there hasn't been anything like it since. It's one of a kind, in a world all by itself. This lion of a movie makes other great films look like little kitties. It's one of the best examples of why I love movies. Pulp fiction is so pure, so smooth, so smart. It's simply one of the greatest movies ever. Tarantino's crown jewel; he'll have a hard time topping this.10 out of 10. Untouchable."
15 October 2010,stathisvoukelatos,1,2,9,All hail to Quentin Tarantino.,"Tarantino's Pulp fiction is arguably one of the best movies of all time.As a matter of fact he made an -one of a kind-flawless movie.First of all Tarantino wrote a great scenario and directed it greatly as well.Each and everybody was superb on their roles making unbelievably cool and stylish characters,from Travolta and Therman to L.Jackson,Willis and Harvey Keitel.There were also plenty magnificent and hilarious catchphrases. Last but not least the movie has one of the best soundtracks has ever been used in a movie. To sum up Pulp Fiction is a great movie from a great director.Thank you Quentin,you once again made a perfect movie..."
20 March 2011,classicsoncall,1,8,10,"""That was f----n' trippy""!","Quentin Tarantino may have broken the mold with ""Pulp Fiction"". Great actors in great performances, smart dialog, and an eclectic ensemble cast make this one of the rare gems in cinematic history. As a fan of non-linear story telling in movies, I found this one a unique challenge, as you get so absorbed in each of the vignettes that it's difficult to double back and figure out where the circle got broken. You'll have to watch this one more than once, and even so, it never gets boring, with mind blowing sequences like those at Jack Rabbit Slim's and Mia's hypo in the chest cure - Whoa!!! But don't take my word for it. You'll have to view the film with sufficient time set aside for liberal use of the re-wind button because it's so unlike anything you're likely to see short of another Tarantino flick."

                        ","This is an ANTI-drug, ANTI-violence film","THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS.  DON'T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO.I'm reading a lot of these messages condemning Tarantino for making a pro-drug, pro-violence movie?  Hello?  Did we see different movies?Just because a director SHOWS drugs or violence doesn't mean that they condone them.  Did anyone watch Uma Thurman's overdose scene and react by craving smack?  And about the violence...of the three leads (Travolta, Jackson, and Willis), only Travolta is committed to a life of violence, and he ends up dead in a toilet.  Willis' character is redeemed by saving the life of his arch enemy, and Jackson's ""holy"" revelation leads him to reject the violent life of a hitman.Any film that takes place in the criminal underworld has to show the viewer elements of sex, drugs, and violence or else lose all credibility.  Deeper analysis of this film, however, shows it to be one of the most morally present films of the '90's."
16 August 2005,Matt_Layden,1,5,10,One of the best films of ALL-TIME,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that grabs you by the throat and won't let go till the end. With it's great cast, incredible direction and unique ( at the time) dialouge, Tarantino has created a movie that will go down in film history as one of the best and will be remember for years to come.Pulp Fiction is 3 stories interconnecting. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace. Marsellus is out of town, and he's gotten Vincent to take care of his wife, Mia. That is, take her out for a night on the town. Butch Coolidge is a boxer who's been approached by Marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are two lovebirds/thieves who have decided to rob the restaurant they're currently eating at. But the restaurant doesn't turn out to be as easy as the other places they've robbed.This is a film that has intense moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, case in point, the overdose scene where they need to inject a shot of adrenaline into Mia's heart. The close up tension from Tarantino and dialouge will have you on the edge of your seat no matter how many times you have seen it. What Pulp Fiction does so well is blend this with comedic scenes and basically ""nothing"" scenes which make it more real then other films that we see.Tarantino manages to get great performances out of mediocre film stars like Travolta and Willis, who steal the show. But not without the supporting cast of so many great and talent actors, who fit their characters to perfection. Samuel L. Jackson is Jules, and no one else.What makes it more interesting is that the three stories connect and are told not in order, so multiple viewings are needed to understand the film as a whole, and with it's length, you would expect it to drag on in certain scenes, but with it's witty dialouge and the superb cast in those scenes you are nothing feeling like it's going on too long.Tarantino has pulled off a great film and I believe will never top it, this film is the best film of the 90's and one of the best films of all time."
25 December 2009,michael_the_nermal,1,3,7,"Tarantino's ""Masterpiece"" is Good, but Overrated","This is it---the movie that turned Quentin Tarantino from a nobody independent film director to one of the titans of film, in a league with Griffith, DeMille, Fleming, Capra, Lean, Minnelli, Ford, Spielberg, Lucas, Coppola and Scorsese, among a whole lot of other directors that are super-famous, but I don't know about because I know little about film as an art. The question: is ""Pulp Fiction"" a timeless masterpiece that should be put up upon a pedestal? My answer: no. It's a good movie, to be sure, and the main characters are, to an extent, well-developed, but Tarantino stuffs his film so full of peculiar hipsterism and allusions to obscure TV shows and movies that it nearly drowns out the plot. It also splits viewers to those ""in the know"" about whatever film or hipster references Tarantino is making, and those who haven't a clue, and either feel the film is eccentric or are chagrined to not be smart enough to get it. This movie has forced elitism in cinema to the mainstream, where arcane references and bold gimmicks (such as a distorted time-line) have been lauded as visionary. Previous mainstream great films were straightforward in their presentation of the story, but had such great plot and acting that they stood on their own without relying on gimmicks. Tarantino takes a decent plot and stuffs it with extraneous stuff and the critics buy into it. This truly is a film that cannot stand on the merits of its actors or plot alone.One thing that will take a viewer off-guard---and which fans tout as an example of Tarantino's ""genius""---are the long periods of weird and pointless dialogue punctuated with fast, flashy violence. Long dialogue seems like a trademark of Tarantino movies, and whether you like or hate his movies depends on how strong your attention span is. In this ADD world of ours, I'd think long, droning dialogue is a major no-no, but somehow Tarantino loves to include it as essential to his films. In some movies, like the ""Death Proof"" half of ""Grindhouse,"" is can be a Bataan Death March form of torture to have to endure. In ""Pulp Fiction,"" it can get boring, but is not too terrible. The scenes where Travolta and Jackson drone on about burgers in France, and where Thurman and Travolta discuss Thurman's audition for a TV show, it is irrelevant and boring, though I'm sure Tarantino fans will tell the unwashed among us that we ""just don't get it."" When Ving Rhames and Harvey Keitel speak, their words relevant, witty and interesting. Jackson's peculiar monologue before killing an enemy, which is a mishmash of Bible verses strung together in a rather incoherent, rambling manner, is fun to listen to, as Jackson says it with rage and passion, but ultimately is meaningless prattle that does little to further the plot until the last chapter of the movie. In all, ""Pulp Fiction"" is full of too much talk that accomplishes nothing to further the plot or convey anything revealing or meaningful about the characters.The disposal of a linear plot line is sometimes relevant to a movie, particularly if it is used to emphasize something about a character or a particular scene. In ""Pulp Fiction"", the nonlinear plot is a device for emphasizing certain characters, whether Travolta's, Jackson's, or Willis's. In essence, ""Pulp Fiction"" is merely four mini-movies connected only by the thread of common characters (all of whom seem to be working for the crime lord played by Ving Rhames). Tarantino is to be commended, in this instance, for not following through with a straightforward plot and instead treating his film more as a character study. If you try to view this film as anything more than four separate character studies, you get a damned mess. The way this film was sold to the public, the nonlinear device's true purpose was not made clear, and first-time viewers will not understand Tarantino's vision on a first-time viewing. In spite of the apparent uniqueness of the nonlinear device, I wonder just how original it is.The violence is gratuitous to an extent, but at least Tarantino explores its morality. The characters of Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson are the most important with regards to the exploration of the morality of a life of crime. They are truly three-dimensional characters who reevaluate their lives. The other characters seem one-dimensional and are less interesting by comparison. Other than the analysis of morality from the two characters mentioned, Tarantino uses violence as a means to shock the viewer. The ""gimp scene"" in the store basement and Uma Thurman's OD scene are simply shocking, with little to recommend to them other than they are violence for the sake of violence. I am not particularly intelligent enough to ""get"" cinema as an art-form, but it seems like violence as an art-form is becoming accepted in serious films, much to the detriment of anything substantive. It is a disturbing trend that Tarantino tries to justify as art. I wish ""serious"" movies would rely less on violence-for-violence's sake. It is not intellectually appealing, and is instead disturbing.Other than being an interesting series of character studies, ""Pulp Fiction"" has little else going for it. This movies shows promise for Tarantino as a crafter of interesting stories, but at the same time it is too preoccupied with trying to be hip. It has spawned a series of inferior imitators that have lowered the quality of cinema as a whole. For this reason, ""Pulp Fiction"" has done more harm than good for American movie-making in general."
24 February 2008,JonSnowsMother,1,2,10,Out of the ordinary movie,"This movie shows you don't need stupid twists to make a great film all it was Was a cool gangster movie which didn't need a big budget. The film is based on three story's first is about two gangsters Vincent(Travolta) and Jules(Jackson) and they got to get something back from these guys who messed with their boss Marsellus Wallace. In that scene is amazing and Samuel L Jackson gives an amazing performance and is so cool. (e.g. Jules faces Bret(The guy who stole Marsellus Wallace money)Jules: What does Marsellus Wallace look like? Bret: What? (Jules points his gun at Bret)Jules: Say what again. Say what again,motherf***** say what one more Goddamn time.Bret: He's b-b-blackJules: Go on Bret: He's bald Jules: Does he look like a bitch? Bret: What (Jules shoots him in the arm) Jules: DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITCHBret: No Jules: Then why you f***ing him like a bitch,Bret? Bret: I didn'tJules: Yes you did. You tried to f**k him and Marsellus Wallace don't like to be f****d by anybody,except Mrs Wallace. Are you Mrs WallaceBret: No Jules: Of course your f***ing not!The second story is about Vincent taking out Marcellus Wallace wife Mia(Thurman) to dinner and Mia almost dies because she took some deadly cocaine Vincent had. The third is about Butch(Willis) a boxer who was payed by Marcellus Wallace to fall in a fight But Butch wins the fight and runs off. But Butch's girlfriend forgets his watch which was given by Captain Koons(Walken) a man Butch's dad was in a prison camp with in Vietnam. Butch risks his life to get the watch and results in him and Marcellus Wallace get captured by two gay rapists. The third and final story is the follow up of the first story about Jules and Vincent. Pulp Fiction is different to other gangster movies but one of the best around. And the best modern gangster movie."
29 February 2008,Sternicus,3,8,6,"That's a pretty f***ing bad movie, can see why it's so popular but it's still pretty f***ing bad.","First off lets focus on why people might like it.1.It makes someone feel tough for being able to watch a movie with ""strong graphic violence"". (It was actually surprisingly boring.) 2.The outfits were as colorful as the music. Lots of weird wigs and blue suits give it a unique look.3.Makes it look like a white guy can say the n-word in front of a black man without having to worry about being knocked out. Quentin Tarantino's character say's ""dead n***er storage"" 3 times in 20 seconds in front of Samuel Jackson.4.Dialouge scenes make you look smart for watching it. Nothing like having someone walk in on you and see you watching 2 people at a table talking, with cigarette smoke in the air to give it that ""Casablanca Noir"" feel.5.It's original. I won't make fun of that aspect, it is original.Now let me tell you why I didn't like it.1.The pace was too slow. It was so slow that the film turned out to be almost three hours long.2.It's too overrated. My cousin told me quote: ""That movie was crazy!"" The only crazy part was the rape scene.3.They didn't show the boxing match where Butch killed the other fighter. Quentin had an opportunity for an action scene amiss all that talking and he chose not to show it. Who would guess a movie with ""strong graphic violence"" or ""graphically violent action"" could be so boring.4. I was expecting the dialog to be better... I just was for some reason.5.Overal I felt I was watching a film that was full of itself. From the opening scene it seemed too contrived, like the director said ""lets put 2 people at a lunch table, let them talk long and fill the air with cigarette smoke so critics will see it as being ""in depth"" like all those phony HBO shows that focus on 'character development.'"" 6.It showed Bruce Willis's penis- like come on I don't want to see that!Overall I'm giving it a 6 out of 10 cause I feel that it's nearly half the film it could have been. Bottom line, if you want to see an ""in depth"" film watch Pulp Fiction- if you want to see something entertaining watch From Dusk Till Dawn, Star Wars, Batman or some other junk.Sorry I don't mean to sound cynical. At least some people liked it, but I didn't."
17 December 2011,royalewithcheese2020,1,2,10,"Best movie of all time, in my opinion.","I can't figure out why I love this movie so much. I have seen it more times than I can count and still it never gets old. It is a very unique movie. I particularly love the ending, and think it is the best scene in cinema history (some great acting by Samuel L. Jackson). The movie isn't meant to have a moral, which is indicated from the ""pulp"" part of the title. But in not trying to teach us a lesson, the film hits even harder with one . I believe the movie is actually very deep with themes such as forgiveness and redemption. One moment Butch is about to kill Marcellus, the next he is saving him. Jules is wrapped up in the life of crime and suddenly he sees a sign from god that he is a terrible person and he acts on this. From Jules passage he has an epiphany that what he has being doing is wrong and realizes he needs to help someone else to start his journey towards redemption. Everyone has something they want to change in their life, something they want improved. This was just the beginning of Jules transformation. Though he isn't just stopping and forgetting all﻿ he has done wrong, he feels he owes a favor to the world and that was just the beginning transformation. If you have seen the movie you will understand."
20 October 2017,MrMowji,5,19,1,One of the worsts!,"Seriously, what was people thinking? 8.9 and 7th movie in IMDb's top 250? I saw this movie long time ago when IMDb ratings was everything to me. Now, I just check reviews, and not just the first page, because at the time of writing, first page of reviews for movies that I see overrated are strangely filled with praises.First of all, there is no story, or if you call it a story, it isn't an interesting one.Filled with long unnecessary conversations that made it 150 minutes. You can easily get bored.Deciding how to clean a bloody car takes 15 minutes of this movie. And it's very cliché. Three men can't decide how to clean a car and need a specialist (Wolf) which when we see him and listen to his words, he isn't one; he's normal.Butch goes back to his house to pick his watch. Then he decides to eat some toast. What was that?Tarantino's acting was awful.Many unnecessary characters; Raquel, the taxi driver, Wolf, Gimp, Trudi, even Tarantino's role.We can drop Mia's story (about 40 minutes) and we're still good to go.He tried to intertwine 4 stories, but they were ordinary. There is nothing to think, nothing to note, nothing to follow.Zed's part!!!Please try some ""foreign language"" movies, and read at least 5 pages of reviews before going to watch a title."
9 May 2017,RUSkiddingPete,2,4,7,Pulp Fiction,"I thought this was a good movie, but I don't think that it deserves to be called one of the best movies ever made. It was good but it wasn't amazing. There are some amazing scenes in this movie, for example the beginning where Vincent and Jules are interrogating Brett, that whole scene is fantastic, also it's my favorite part of the movie. The reason why I say it's okay is because I only really was interested in the movie when Samuel L. Jackson was on scene. I'm not saying that because I'm a big Samuel L. Jackson fan, I'm saying that because he was the most interesting character in the movie and he was my favorite character. There are a few other really good scenes, but sadly I just didn't think that there were that many."

                        ",A timeless classic. Truly a masterpiece.,"What can there be said about this movie that hasn't already been stated a thousand times before. It's nearly perfect in every single regard. The writing and dialogue are out of this world. It's endlessly rewatchable and quotable. Anything that comes out of Samuel L. Jackson's mouth is cinematic gold at its finest. The dialogue itself actually makes you feel like you're watching real people, someone you could actually talk with in real life. Take Vincent (John Travolta), for example. He's a murdering drug addict who doesn't feel much besides annoyance when he accidently shoots someone in the face. But because if the dialogue, you actually feel sad when Butch (Bruce Willis) kills him.All of the cast is perfect, but Sam Jackson and John Travolta as Jules and Vincent are the clear standouts. They have unbelievable chemistry with one another and the banter between the two are some of my favorite parts from the movie. All of the other cast members are amazing as well, Bruce Willis gave the performance of his lifetime, along with Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and especially Ving Rhames. Also, brief as his screentime was, Christopher Walken gave my favorite movie monologue ever.So that brings us to the story. From a simple storytelling standpoint, this is one of the most unique movies out there. It's tense, always unoredictable and a hell of a lot of fun. Despite the story parts being out of order, it still feels infinitely more focused than most of the entertainment released today.Because of all of these things mentioned above, I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece. It is the one movie that I continuously find myself coming back to and never get bored."

17 June 2014,Paladin_Sean,6,10,10,Master craft film making,"To put it simply this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece. Quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion. Be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles, drugs and a lot of violence. But that just adds to the movie for me. The plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable. When I turned 40 I did something I always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that I chose for my friends and I to watch was Pulp Fiction. It is at the top of IMDb's top 250 and it is on AFI's top 100 for a reason, it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favorites."
17 March 2006,schenkenberg,3,6,10,The best American film,"1994 was a very good year to the American films. Two brilliant works were released, ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". For me, they are both the symbols of America. ""Pulp Fiction"" is the coolest film I have ever seen. It is exciting, funny and relaxing. I have seen it many times but there is always something new what I have not noticed before. This is a story where all main characters are criminals. They do their jobs just like us, as well as they can. They do not talk with each other about guns, police and crimes. They discuss different topics, from fast food to foot massage. There are no scenes in the film that do not fit there. Many viewers think that the scene where Butch and Marcellus Wallace are violently raped by a cop and a salesman, is too extreme. But I think this scene is necessary to understand the entire film. It is shown that people can be very cruel, and it does not depend on whether one is a mafia boss or a policeman. Now to my favourite spots. The scene where Vincent and Jules visit their victims is one of the best in the film history. Vincent just goes and stands away from the others who give him frightened looks. Jules starts a friendly conversation, talking about hamburgers. After finishing the poor guy's Sprite, Jules gets to business. He asks unusual questions and presents an extract from the Bible which drives the young boys absolutely scared. And finally, when the last guy appears and empties his gun without a single hit, Jules and Vincent exchange glances and shoot him. This is totally excellent! Then we see Vincent taking Mia out. They arrive at the Jackrabbit Slim's, Vincent is displeased with something, and Mia draws a box in the air. Genius! Later when they sit and have their drinks, Vincent says he has to take a leek. Mia answers: ""That's a little bit more information than I needed..."" It is amusing to observe how Vincent is trying very hard to look cool. His every movement is supposed to express being cool. He looks absolutely ridiculous actually. This illustrate the fact that men try to seem cool to women but usually the ladies do not buy it. The twist scene is also very clever. Dancing in front of the public must be a huge surprise to Vincent but he dances so well that they win the contest. About the prologue of ""The Golden Watch"". Major Coons enters to talk to little Butch. The Major speaks seriously to show how important his lines are. Looking dead serious, he describes how several men carried the watch in their butts and how he eventually put it in his butt. That was really funny. In the end, Vincent and Jules drop at Jimmy's to hide a body Vincent has accidentally shot. Jimmy is totally furious and explains that there is no sign on his house which says ""Dead N...rs stored here"". They call Mr. Wolf who starts with praising Jimmy's coffee and then gives instructions. He finally dresses the boys with Jimmy's clothes and says they look like dorks. Jules replies to Jimmy's laughter: ""Your clothes, m...r."" Mr. Wolf refuses in a very elegant way to give Jules and Vincent a ride, and ends his show with the line ""Call me Winston."" I found no weaknesses in the film. Dialogue is funny, characters are very colourful, soundtrack cannot be compared to any film, and the actors are brilliant. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make their best appearances ever. Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken make short but memorable roles. Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are also good to watch. ""Pulp Fiction"" has started a new era in film-making. There are many films inspired by Tarantino's work. Guy Ritchie has achieved the best results in ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch."" but inspired by Tarantino, he has created his own style which is too different to compare with ""Pulp Fiction"". If you are not a fan of such movies, do not hesitate. If nothing else, then Samuel L. Jackson's haircut is well worth watching."
31 March 2020,i-87537,1,2,8,Two pieces of dancing music,"I like this movie and this electric soundtrack. The two favorite songs are all related to dancing. First, the swing dance in the car bar is the soundtrack of one of the most famous passages in the movie history, ""jack rabbit slims twist contest"", which shows the music alive with a twisted body and fierce guitar playing. Then there is the song girl,you'll be a woman soon, which Uma put home after winning the trophy."
27 July 2010,BenZimmer97,4,7,9,Pulp Fiction: The Greatest movie of the 90's,"Pulp Fiction has to be the best movie you want to watch when you're bored and there's nothing on. When I first watched it, it was 11 on a boring night and everyone in my house went to sleep. I was flipping through channels and looking at my guide, and I saw Pulp Fiction. I turned it on and luckily it was the very beginning. I say Luckily because it would be very confusing if you watch it from half way through on. After watching the beginning scene, and the credits rolling, I knew it was going to be awesome. The movie is about 3 different stories of crime, all linked or connected in some way. What is also great and different, is that they interlock in time. In one story, one of the main characters gets killed and then comes back in the next story. It was weird, knowing he was going to get killed. Quentin Tarantino may be the most coolest guy to work with. (Maybe, he has a big temper.) But his movies are awesome. He is also the most skilled at screenplays. Listen to this movie. This makes me actually think he is in the mob. Another great movie of his is ""Reservoir Dogs"", a movie about a heist gone totally wrong. And what's cool about him is, he could cast himself in his movies as the main character, but instead plays the small parts. He made careers. Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, and even Steve Buscemi. He resurrected careers. John Travolta, Harvey Keitel,and Lawrence Tierney. This movie is nothing less than entertaining and masterful. Including an all star cast. Must see."

Their story seemed finished and had run its course and don't think it was a good idea to go back, still a good but isn't neededThey call in the Wolf to help fix the situationBut this leads all the way back to the diner scene that started the movie which I will say is clever, the movie is pieced together well but could be hard to follow the timeline the first time aroundJules says he is out after all of this after they deliver the case to MarsellusWhen the robbery starts Vega is in the bathroom, there's a standoff for the case with Jules and the robbersAgain the scene just seems to drag on too long killing the tension, again still a good sceneJules lets them go after a long story about him turning a new leaf and the film endsI like the unsolved mystery of what is in the case
Dialogue of the film in smart and well written and fits the characters wellWell developed characters with a plethora of great performancesSome very creative situations that Tarantino creates giving the viewer quite a few memorable momentsThe biggest flaw of the film is that some of the dialogue scenes which is what most of the film is just run on far too longMovie probably would have been a better watch if they cut out 20 minutes or so and just got to the point of the scene fasterThis is my third time watching the film and this is easily the most I have enjoyed itCinematography was pretty good and there were some memorable shots like the trunk shotOverall well made film that is filled with memorable moments and dialogue that just drags on too long"
11 March 2009,god_machine,23,53,1,"All (Stolen) Style, & No Substance","This film stands out like no other as an utter piece of sh!te. When I see all the accolades and devotion that film receives it makes me want to vomit not only all the bile in my body, but the blood that is contained in it as well.Pulp Fiction, is a testament to our downward spiraling American society. It is a monument to the shallowness, the arrogance, and vapidness of our self-obsessed culture that dwells in the American consumer mind. Only in America, a talentless director whose only ability is to plagiarize greater works can become the most celebrated creator to ever enter film-making.But you can't say a word because his following is ravenously sycophant. They know ever word, every phrase, every bit of dialogue. But they certainly don't know the difference between the real deal and a cheap imposter. Sam Pekinpah never sat down watched a slew of movies and said I'm gonna steal this scene or that dialogue from this movie and directly put it in my movie. Nope he created his own stuff. He may have sat down and wanted the same feelings to be interpreted in his films, but never exactly the same way. Neither did Sergio Leone, John Carpenter, George Romero, Ringo Lam, Bo Arne Vibenius, Simon Nuchtern, The Shaw Brothers, Joseph Sargent, Akira Kurosawa, François Truffaut, or even Robert Aldrich. Even George Lucas, after the atrocities that he has committed to his own films in later years has done this.Most of the names that mentioned are probably unmemorable or unrecognizable to most people, but they are in fact only a few in a very long list of directors whose have been stolen by Tarantino (except, of course, George Lucas - so far anyway).Anyways that does not mean his movies do not have merit. The earlier ones like Pulp Fiction are laded with quirky and funny dialogue. But thats all they have because plot, characterization, and substance have gone out the door. Tarantino can't even tell you a linear story. He uses a disjointed structure to hide the weak plot. He uses clever dialog to take place of decent characterization. In fact, the funniest thing to me is that his seem to have a non-stop spouting of words, they never seem to stop talking, but in the end they never really have anything to say."
3 July 2020,samarth-78498,1,1,10,Describe!! What Marcellus Wallace looks like!!!,"Of all the films i have ever seen, nothing has been more fun and thrilling ever. This movie is a revolution. It can be watched as an enjoyment, a character study or a philosophical movie. The dialogue are engaging, they attract your full attention and never feel forced.
The movie can also be seen as a lesson in the nature of events that take place in our lives. It has both type of events taking place within it's time, those which we have control on and those that are completely out of the blue but have to be dealt with.
It has characters who are more or less of same personality but their driving forces are different and as a result their decisions are different and deciding factor in their life, whether it be Jules' divine intervention that indirectly saves his life or Vincent's carelessness that ends up taking his life or Butch's constant struggle with Pride, the movie speaks volumes if you truly think about it rather than passing it as a normal crime film. For me Tarantino at his finest"
22 January 2003,stuch,1,2,9,"Better then R.Dogs, but i prefer R.Dogs.","I have been really meaning to see this, however I have not been able to get a hold of a copy until yesterday. Borrowed it from a friend.*SLIGHT SPOILERS*I thought it would be entertaining and broaden my horizons. It did both these things and more. I laughed more than I have ever done at a comedy. I cringed more than I ever have at a horror.Firstly, the stories, all expertly written by Tarintino and Avery. All with totally believable characters.Sometimes Jules and Vincent just spoke about anything, which I liked. At first I thought it was just to fill in time. But then I really got into what they were blabbing about.Tim Roth's character of Ringo was just so good. Made me laugh and made me feel sorry for him. Butch, I enjoyed his story from start to finish. His ignorant girlfriend, his watch, the run in with Zed and his friends. But one cameo, by Christopher Walken had me in stitches. I was able to hold it in until the word ""disentary"". Then it just....went.Anyway....absolutely amazing, well worth watching unless you don't like violence, language, drug use or ball gags.9/10"
10 May 2013,BatmanAndRobyn,1,2,9,My first Tarantino film,"With the recent release of Django Unchained, I've been meaning to watch at least one Tarantino film. I'm glad this was my first one, partially because it's considered a classic, and partially because it's a good ease into Tarantino's film style. When this movie was finished, I was genuinely surprised by how much I liked it.I really like how the film was cut up into parts. Although they were not in order, it was still really easy to piece together and follow along with. The acting in the film was really fantastic. I especially enjoyed how Travolta and Jackson kept going back to casual conversations after killing someone like nothing had even happened. I thought that added the right amount of humor. Every separate story kept me interested. I liked how they all overlapped and how the ending(s) tied everything together.This film also had great photography and music. I really liked how the music fit with the film. Even the opening credits were entertaining to watch because of the track playing in the background.Also, by watching this film, it made me really wish that Jack Rabbit Slim's existed."
9 May 2013,Taffyta,1,2,7,Amusingly Dark,"Normally a movie with as much violence as this is not something I'd like to watch. But there was something about it that was great, I believe it was the humor. The movie is pretty serious and something will go wrong or they are confronting someone, but the acting and the dialog just make it funny. How upset can you be when Vincent and Jules are bickering over a major deal, as if it were a common annoyance? The flashbacks and forwards were only briefly confusing for me, but I was able to catch on quickly enough. I was trying to come up with the main point of a movie like this and had trouble. But I did recognize that Jules repeats a Bible quote a couple times. What I gather from it is that Jules says it to people thinking that he is the good man, getting rid of the evil men for the good of mankind. But that couldn't be right, because of how he executes that. If anything, he's just as much of an evil person. The movie ends with the beginning, so then you can think back to if Jules really did take that into consideration before he acted out."
13 December 2014,shavonnacroley,1,2,7,Pulp Fiction (1994),"A great amount of people believe that Pulp Fiction is the greatest of all time when it comes to films. Sad to say this but I do not agree. I finally watched this movie for the first time this year and I didn't care for it, it sort of felt like a let down. Maybe this is just because I didn't like the plot itself, though the use of flashbacks (if that word is even close) was pretty smart. I liked that we were brought to a certain time period but later on brought to somewhere different and soon after be brought right back to where it all started. I thought this technique was brilliant. The main characters were over the top in my opinion...while watching this film I wondered what was the point of it all. This film just wasn't my cup of tea and it's sad because I was really looking forward to watching it, some what of a disappointment. But this is me, I'm sure many will disagree."
10 May 2013,uziesuzie,1,2,10,Ketchup,"I really love how Quentin Tarentio reuses his cast through out his movies. Every main character from his previous hit ""Reservoir Dogs"" made some kind of appearance in"" Pulp Fiction"". Not only do the actors tie his individual movies together, but if you look back from his current movies to some of his first films, you can usually find a little microcosm from that film that he used as a base to create a new film.The movie had a good rhythm even with the scenes being out of order. It defiantly keeps you thinking about the film and how the story really played out. This film is pretty violent, but not as much as Tarentio's newer films. Tarentio has his own style and is totally an auteur director of the modern film profession. I would highly recommend seeing his films, but be ready for some Extreme violence."
22 January 2022,safenoe,0,0,8,Ezekiel 25:17,"I can't belive it's taken me nearly 30 years to finally write a review here. Hard to believe Pulp Fiction is nearly 30 years old!

2 September 2021,bombersflyup,0,1,10,"Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?","Pulp Fiction is just damn cool, with an exceptional cast.They're all quality segments and performances, minus Roth, Plummer and Tarantino himself, Willis my favourite. It's not perfect though, as there's no overall story or point and it's random and unrealistic. Plus with this style you're not invested in the characters as much either, but you can't deny it's thoroughly entertaining and first-rate. As for being Tarantino's best film, I prefer Jackie Brown myself, but this is certainly 2nd."
30 October 2002,Donman1967,1,1,9,ONLY bad point was Quentin's cameo...,"Excellent film with a memorable screenplay, and an awe-inspiring performace by Mistah Jackson.  The only reason I can't bring myself to give it the full '10' it probably deserves would have to be Mr. Tarantino's (thankfully) brief performance as Jules' buddy.  His performance during the ""coffee/dead ni**er storage"" scene was rather brutal.  With that one exception, Samuel L., John Travolta, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel, Uma (Oprah?), Ving-man and Bruce Willis all put in fine performances (again, with the last scene involving Jackson and Roth the most impactful) that only get stronger with repeat viewings.  Of course, I'll always have the question in my mind of whether or not Jules ever DID leave ""the business"", and if Mr. Wallace rescinded the ""there is no you and me - not no more"" he gave to Willis' character, (Spoiler) after finding out that Vincent Vega was dead (not to mention the obvious one of what the heck WAS in that briefcase), but that's just one of the many ways this new classic affected me - and undoubtedly the legions of other fans it captivated upon its release.  9.5/10"
8 December 2014,john-hogan23,1,2,10,"""I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet.""","Essential viewing. This film is an absolute heavyweight. I must have seen it dozens of times by now, and it doesn't really ever stop being entertaining. A lot of the most well made movies don't really allow themselves to be fun. They try to be more of a statement, and I love that, it brings me an immense joy to watch a classically structured, no-nonsense, beautifully artful film. But Pulp Fiction is just so much fun that it managed to infiltrate the ranks of the elite, and when it got there it decided to throw a party.What's not to love about Pulp Fiction? Every aspect is built like a roller coaster; the film is just a big, crazy amusement park. Most important to me, though, and I'm sure many others, would have to be the story's structure. Have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film? It's crazy. It's like when the film is in the correct order it doesn't make sense anymore. It wouldn't fit the film because it's too much fun for an A to B. The way Quentin Tarantino weaved the film's content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. The film just flows. The transitions are so fluid. And the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. Just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. Vincent, Jules, and Butch are really just normal people in the world of Pulp Fiction, but to the viewer they're so much larger than life. Not only do Vincent and Jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners, but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry Vincent and Butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. The conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. Jules, though, Jules is excellent. A great character played by a great actor. Samuel L Jackson steals every single scene he's in. His monologues are legendary. This man must have needed some great vengeance AND furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. He was one bad mother.I remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. I thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandora's box on my concept of what a movie could be. Looking back, I think I was right."
15 June 2015,anaconda-40658,0,2,9,Tarantino's World.,"Pulp Fiction (1994): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel: Exhilarating masterpiece taking a comic book approach to its themes as if addressing a surreal reality. Screenplay divides into three stories. The first one introduces John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase. Then Travolta is instructed to take the boss's wife out where an evening at the Jack Rabbit Slim ends with an overdose and a dripping needle held high for revival. Story two regards a boxer who double crosses his boss and flees with money, but when his wife forgot a valuable watch back at the apartment, he makes a dangerous venture into unexpected turmoil. Story three involves dispatching a corpse within limited time. Brilliantly crafted by Quentin Tarantino who previously made Reservoir Dogs, but here he creates an original masterpiece. Flawless acting by Travolta as a hit-man often caught in bad situations. Jackson as his partner is more reserved and careful. Bruce Willis delivers perhaps his greatest performance as a boxer bent on survival when a flashback involving a watch indicates its importance. Uma Thurman plays the drug addicted boss's wife with a mysterious past. Harvey Keitel plays a cleanup guy called upon when a body ends up in a trunk. Tense portrayal of violent lifestyles and the consequences. Score: 9 / 10"
2 October 2014,Mr-Fusion,0,1,8,"It set the world on fire, and for good reason","I can absolutely understand why PULP FICTION has achieved the lofty cultural status it has. Even if you don't like some of the subject matter or Tarantino's seedy underworld, this is an exceedingly well-written movie; very violent and occasionally hilarious. The situations are absurd and there's great dark humor that arises because of this. And QT knows how to go from ridiculous to tense and unsettling at the drop of a hat. It's unbelievable how much enjoyment can be had from two people talking, and the movie is driven by these very conversations. And this is one bulletproof cast, right down to its bit parts. Even the violence is so over-the- top and in such bizarre situations that you can't help but laugh at how nonsensical it all is. This movie has grade-A dialogue (it's quotable beyond measure), the jumbled narrative works extremely well for the movie's unexpectedly connected stories, and it went a long way in defining the '90s (it certainly redefined Dick Dale's Misirlou). Not a bad movie, either.8/10"
1 February 2014,Red-Barracuda,0,1,10,The moment where Tarantino peaked,"It almost goes without saying that Pulp Fiction was one of the most influential and iconic films of the 90's. In all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard. I can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed. I had loved Quentin Tarantino's earlier Reservoir Dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie. Seeing it again recently I have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema. And even though I have enjoyed all of Tarantino's films since, there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90's crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography. In those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories, as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts. Pulp Fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish.It's essentially three stories entwined. All on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but Tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original. The chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film. The script is full of pop cultural references, inventive profanity, witticisms and even many moments of wisdom. Tarantino's primary gift, and the one he will be remembered for, is his gift for dialogue. You get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word; this isn't a film that feels improvised in any way. On some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive, as the script is quite simply genius in many ways. This great writing has created some excellent iconic characters. It doesn't do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout. Well, with the exception of Tarantino's cameo that is – he's pretty terrible and should really never act. But otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Uma Thurman. Jackson probably steals the show with the character Jules but Travolta is very impressive and convincing as Vincent Vega – you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm. Thurman and Willis play typical film-noir characters, namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight – both are excellent. While Keitel and Walken have cameo roles, with the former as the very memorable Mr Wolf, while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt.So what's it all about? Well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it. Its influence is other movies such as Italian poliziotteschi and American film noir, with a huge post-modernist make-over. Films specifically referenced include The Italian Connection (a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out) and Kiss Me Deadly (a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow). It is essentially a crime-comedy, with a real focus on humour. This means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect. While the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact. It is, for example, a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character (Vincent) and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade. We know he is doomed but can't help but completely forget this fact. It's one of many reasons that this film stands out. One of the very best of the 90's and Tarantino's masterpiece."
18 September 2014,Pjtaylor-96-138044,0,1,8,"Seemingly about nothing, yet strangely engrossing.","Pulp Fiction is often hailed as one of the best movies ever to be made. It's constantly praised for it's masterful script, and in my opinion deserves to be so. But the film often feels as though it isn't actually about anything. Some scenes feature dialogue that appears entirely random and never comes back into play. Indeed, I sometimes wonder if Tarantino just wrote about whatever he wanted to. Despite all this, however, the movie is cohesive and surprisingly gripping.On top of that it's decidedly realistic: while the characters go through strange things and they aren't exactly your average Joes (afterall, two of them are assassins and another is a boxer on the run from a mob boss), the situations and reactions could happen in the real world. Once you accept that Vincent is an assassin for the mob, it's very plausible that he'd talk about foreign McDonald's with his partner, shoot up some dudes and then have to save his boss' wife from a heroin overdose. So while the conversations may seem unrelated to anything, they actually cement each character in the world that Tarantino has created and help them feel real.The acting is also great across the board. My favourite has to be Samuel L Jackson as Jules. The guy knows how to embody the character that Tarantino envisioned, but simultaneously makes every line of scripted dialogue feel like ad-lib. Jules acts and sounds like a real person, in what is a perfect blend of script and actor. The other actors do a great job too, even if they only appear for one scene. Christopher Walken played it serious in a scene where the dialogue took a turn for the silly (discussing hiding a watch up his ass). I also loved Harvey Kietel as Mr.Wolf, the man who fixes things. His scene was one of the highlights of the movie, and it was largely due to his expert delivery.Overall, Pulp Fiction is a movie driven by its witty and unique script. You may struggle to find a message hidden within it, but I believe that there is one there (Jules' monologue at the end presents the fact that he has made a clear moral choice of not to kill, and Butch shows heroism when given the chance to simply escape.) In the end, though, it's not about that. It's simply about enjoying the gripping characters and crazy events that Tarantino has dreamt up. 8/10"

                        ",A Masterpiece with the strongest screenplay and acting you will ever see!,"Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction I was kinda bored with the dialogue, but I still knew it was a 'quality' film(I saw it like a year ago). The second time I saw it with my parents, and I ended up hating it. The reason is because my parents were SO mad at me for seeing the film, they despised it, saying it had drugs, it was pointless, and the gay rape scene really shocked them. They told me to throw the DVD away. Wel, that hate has stayed on with me, but since I am making a top 55 list, I want to see where it places. I mean, if I hate it, then it wont be that high, YET I know it is a good film.I watched it for a third time, and I have to say, this time I enjoyed it the most. I watched it by myself in my room, just hearing the great dialogues. The screenplay is probably the best for someone to read. The way the film starts, and goes in unchronological order is simply well done. It was a genius idea. The memorable lines, dialogues between Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the great scenes between Vincent and Jules. Yes, it is very dark, not in a scary way, but in a comedic disturbing way, and that is probably why my parents hated it so much. I can say that it truly is a landmark of a film. It created a whole new path for films. It began great dialogue scenes between characters, and it is the mother of all 'character developments'. There are a lot of scenes that seem 'unimportant', but that is the beauty of Pulp Fiction. That is also the reason why a lot of people hate it, but to deny it's brilliance is so not understandable.The film says so little, yet so much, It is a film about god. That is what I believe, since Jules goes through revelations. The whole film is to show how cruel the world can be, having some of the weirdest, most shocking, disturbing scenes ever. A man talks to a child about how his father and himself had to have a gold watch up their asses for years... How insane! We see a man who is called 'The Gimp' and how he helps another man rape other men. We see a woman talking about how she wants a pot belly, and that she wants blueberry pancakes. We see A man talking to a kid who is sitting in the back of the car, then the kid is accidentally shot in the face... These are just some of the situations that happen. Not to mention really famous scenes that come from this movie, like an overdose, and probably one of the greatest hostage crisis in history, in a restaurant! Another aspect why this film works so well is because of the acting. A great certain of performances in this film look like they should all deserve Oscar nominations at least. The most notable must be Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. His performance is so strong and exhilarating and out of the water that you can tell he got some buzz, and he should have actually won the Oscar(under leading, because he really had the same amount of screen time that Travolta had). Uma Thurman's performance as Mia Wallace also deserved the Oscar. Her acting was so fresh, she really made the character her own. John Travolta was also very good, but I think there were better. Amanda Plummer as Honey Bunny in the restaurant scenes, she really also deserves an Oscar nomination. Tim Roth also was worthy of it. Of course, the reason the actors are able to shine is because of the screenplay(the best part of the film). It is surely in the top 3 I have ever read.Pulp Fiction is a Masterpiece, whether you like it or not. It surely helped for a lot of film events, such as the unchronological order of scenes, the way dialogue is written, as well as mystery(what's in the case?) This is a force to be reckoned with."
14 May 2006,teniente91,1,3,10,Tarantino's Masterpiece,"''Pulp Fiction'' here in Mexico called ''Tiempos Violentos'' it's a cultural symbol whit six nominations and one win Acadmy Awards it's make one box of impact ant and strange moments but impacts in more part whit great ac tings, great editing, great soundtrack, great director and... f***, the best screenplay of the decade, perfect in all aspects, for me my favorite moment it's when coming this private to the home of Butch kid and saying he ''this clock are of your grandfather... your father save this clock in his a**, and when he died, i save this clock in my a** for five years and now i give you this clock'' and the kid... wherever it's very good and strange, I whit all heart give the Oscar to best motion picture of the year to this movie it's much better of ''Forrest Gump''"
25 October 2021,The-Sarkologist,0,2,9,A Modern Classic,"I remember a number of years ago I was having a discussion with a friend from Church about how Pulp Fiction is a story of a hitman who finds God. Yeah, it is actually like that in part, but I do feel that there is more to this film than just Jules having an epiphany and becoming a Christian, though it is interesting to see the contrast between him and Vincent, since there is an extended discussion between the events in Brett's apartment and whether what happened was due to divine intervention, or just luck.I also remember the first time I saw this film - it was actually in the cinema when it had just hit the screens. I had seen the trailers and really wanted to see it, namely because of the trailer, and having just watched the trailer (though I suspect that it wasn't the original one that I saw on television all those years ago) I can sort of see why I was attracted to it. Mind you, what surprised me that night at the cinema was firstly that it was packed, and secondly when we left there was a huge line outside that snaked out of the cinema. This really surprised me considering that I didn't expect this film to be in the league of films where screenings would be packed out on opening night.Mind you, one thing that I have to say when I saw the film that first time was that I didn't get it. In fact, I get the feeling that most people who watched the film that night didn't get it either, and I suspect that was because of the comments that were coming from the people who were waiting to go and watch the film we, and the rest of the cinema, filed out.The thing is that Pulp Fiction is an experimental film, and it certainly follows on from Reservoir Dogs. It is a crime film dealing with criminals, but the discussions that the criminals have painted somewhat well rounded characters. In fact, it undermines the concept of the bad guy simply being one dimensional entities that simply exist for good guys to kill. Actually, the thing about this film is there isn't actually a character that would be termed as being good, at least none of the major characters. Each of them exists in the realm of the criminal underworld, yet many of them do things that are considered selfless. Not all of them, since Vincent acts from his own self interest, whereas Butch, despite being hunted by Marcellus, decides to head back and save him, though one could argue that he did this to extract a favour from Marcellus, which he eventually does.One interesting thing is the use of restrooms in the film. Whenever Vincent goes into a restroom something bad happens, but that is not always the case. For instance, when Marcellus' wife goes into the restroom, when she returns her food is on the table, and she makes the classic quote 'don't you love it when you come back from the restroom and your food is on the table'. This isn't the case with Vincent, because when he comes back from a restroom, Marcellus' wife is ODing, the diner he is in is being held up, and of course, he gets shot as well.Conversations are interesting as well, and Tarrantino actually weaves this idea into the conversation between Vincent and Marcellus' wife. This is the idea that when two people are together they have to always be talking, as there seems to be this idea that silence is uncomfortable. She is actually rebelling against that but suggesting that silence doesn't need to be uncomfortable, and that we should actually get used to just sitting in silence and appreciating each other's company.Of course, there is also the idea of the struggle between divine intervention and luck. Jules recognises his life as being divine intervention, and upon reaching that realisation decides that he will change his life according to this. Vincent, on the otherhand, rejects this, and as it turns out it is to his detriment. Most of the bad things that happen to Vincent, such as Marcellus' wife, and of course his death, happens after that conversation. Sure, there is the scene where he accidentally shoots the guy in the back of the car, but that goes to further demonstrate the differences between Marcellus and Jules - Jules follows The Wolf's instructions, while Vincent complains, such as when he asks The Wolf to say please.Finally I should mention the minutiae, namely because Tarrantino loves his minutiae. For instance, there is the coffee, where they have a discussion about the good coffee that Jimmy purchases, which sets up the scene where The Wolf makes a hand gesture to suggest that yes, the coffee is pretty good. There is also the bit at the beginning where Pumpkin addresses the waitress as 'garcon' to which she replied 'garcon means boy'. However, it was the heroin scene that was pointed out to me, because when he purchases it, the dealer says that he doesn't have any balloons, so he will have to package it another way, which Vincent agrees. Now, apparently, one of the reasons Marcellus' wife mistook it for cocaine is because heroin is packaged in balloons, and cocaine in bags, and because it was in a bag, she thought it was cocaine. Mind you, there are numerous discussions about this on the internet, so I'll leave it there.Anyway, this is a pretty awesome film, and ended up having a huge impact upon cinema since. It has also become a cult classic, and despite the fact that at first I didn't get it, and as such, didn't like it, over time I have really come to appreciate the artistry that this film represents."
9 May 2014,m-visker,1,2,9,Pulp Fiction,"With no doubt Pulp Fiction is a modern day classic, and there is good reason why there is so much hype around the movie. The story can be a little confusing at times to follow due to the fact that there is two stories happening at once, but when you get the flow of the movie down it is a very enjoyable to watch. The acting is phenomenal and the writing is amazing, it is no surprise that the movie won an Oscar for it's original screenplay. The dialogue is smart and witty through-out the movie, it also uses silences to make scenes more powerful and intense. The conversations feel real as if these people, even though ridiculous, could exist. The editing in this movie is also very strong, one scene in which I find it to be great is the overdose and adrenaline shot scene. Vincent is speeding down the highway with Mia who is having an overdose, he is frantically calling the drug dealer, the camera then switches to the drug dealer, the shot is slow and doesn't cut to anything, giving the effect that he is in no rush to pick up his phone, and is very unaware for what is about to happen. Once Vincent gets to the house we hear the car screech down the road, the camera follows the drug dealer out and the camera isn't quick or steady but instead shaky as if we are running behind following him outside. This adds to the chaos of the scene. Once they have Mia laying down the camera switches between the characters faces, really letting us the panic the two guys are having and the two girls don't seem nearly as worked up. Right before the shot is given we are given zoomed shots of Vincent's face and the drug dealers face again, there is almost no sound, all of this just intensifies the scene and builds up suspense. This scene is serious and yet entertaining because of the banter between the two men. Pulp Fiction is a great movie in many ways and isn't for the faint of hearts, Tarantino is very innovative and uses editing, cinematography and sound to really capture the mise-en-scene of this film."
21 July 2012,gwnightscream,0,4,8,"""One Of Tarantino's Best!""","John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stoltz, Roseanna Arquette, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and Christopher Walken star in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 crime thriller. This film takes place in the course of 2 days with 3 tales centering on 2 hit men, Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Jackson), Boxer, Butch Coolidge (Willis), Crime boss, Marcellus Wallace (Rhames) and his new wife, Mia (Thurman). Keitel plays Marcellus' associate, Winston Wolf, Stoltz plays Vincent's dope-dealing friend, Lance, Arquette plays Lance's wife, Jodi, Roth plays Pumpkin, Plummer plays his girl, Honeybunny, Walken plays a military captain, Koons and Tarantino also makes an appearance as Jules' friend, Jimmy. This is a great film that's definitely one of Tarantino's best with a cool cast I recommend."
13 October 2013,pettitt2,1,1,10,One of the Best,"Pulp Fiction is a great movie that can bring generations together. My Parents, grandparents, and even my younger siblings all enjoy getting to relax and enjoy this movie that will give you everything you want in a movie. For those who have a weak stomach or dislike movies with any blood at all, I do not recommend. However if you are willing to suck it up and watch a movie where witty remarks are constant throughout the movie and have the possibility of making you think just a bit to understand what was meant by the characters. This movie is one of my favorites because it does a fabulous job convincing and getting you to suspend your disbelief. I will never forget the first time I watched Pulp Fiction and listened to the logic of robbing a café. From that moment I knew that this was going to be a well done and fantastic movie that could compel me to believe what was going on and fear for the characters within this world of Pulp Fiction."

                        ",Crazy story about people living crazy lives,"There is nothing normal about this story. It's about gangsters, and life in their context.Familiar phrase sex drugs and rock n roll plus killing sums up the lives the thugs' lives in this movie. It's a very stylized life of gangs, and I guess that's why the movie's called pulp fiction.Travolta and Samuel Jackson plays the hit men. Uma Thurman is the wife of the gang boss, and Bruce Willis plays the boxer who's on the run. Four of them causes/gets into all sorts of mayhem, and in the end there seems to be no conclusion to the story.The story is bit schizophrenic, and is like conglomeration of short stories in no particular context. It's not an intelligent movie, but it's not dumb either. It glorifies some aspect of gang life. The whole movie has a bluesy feel to it, and maybe that's what the audience resonates to about this movie.Irresponsibility's of the characters makes you want to live a life like them if only for a moment. The whole movie is like a moving poster of life from the past."

11 August 2006,moviedude-72,1,2,10,"Complex and confronting, but still a masterpiece","In the minds of most people, Pulp Fiction is a collection of recycled movie scenes, punctuated by extreme violence, 70's music, and pop culture references. That's supposedly all it takes to make a Quentin Tarantino movie. Yet, how many movies have there been since which have copied this ""formula"" that are as fresh, energetic, alive and exciting? None. Pulp Fiction remains the best movie of the 1994, and perhaps the decade.Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. As in his previous ""Reservoir Dogs"", he and writer Roger Avary create a web of events and characters that ultimately all play parts of a larger story, they connect. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies.Every actor in Pulp Fiction gives a career-topping performance in every role (has Bruce Willis ever been better? Uma Thurman, she was great in Kill Bill though). Travolta especially shines, back in top form after years of bad movies. His smooth, underconfident junkie Vincent Vega is our link to all three stories. He ""plays"" a different character depending on who he's on screen with. He talks jivey when on screen with Jules, cool when with Mia Wallace, and tough in his brief scene with Butch. He doesn't have the confidence to be himself at any time. It's a great performance. When Vincent and Jules begin the movie by hassling the three young cons, they ""get into character"" before entering the room. Jackson is mesmerizing as Jules, fearsome and religious. Frank Whaley, Steve Buscemi, Peter Green, and Christopher Walken also appear in bit parts.Overall, not for the squeamish and light hearted, but not to be written off or underestimated, this is riveting and discomforting storytelling. It can be a difficult, rattling experience, but this reviewer has found its rewards to vastly outweigh its weaknesses, Pulp Fiction is a landmark film and the director has created a wonderfully, rich, diverse satire of violence and campy black humor...combined with a awesome soundtrack.See It If You Liked: Natural Born Killers, Go, Reservoir Dogs10/10-Luke Rowe"
26 September 2016,bmfinite-60218,1,1,10,Wonderful Film,Quentin Taratino always have something up his sleeve for the audience. He's not your ordinary director with a simple minded plot and some action here and there.He makes think about one thing but you come to figure out while watching that had nothing to do with movie but what was the main plot of the movie. he makes you describe your own ending and your own conclusion. The Film contains 3 perspectives of 3 characters and how there choices in the present could affect there future badly and what they can do to prevent that from happening. The film is unique and original and its never to late to see this mind blowing film.
21 August 2021,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,0,1,9,Pulp Fiction,"What is in the case? There isn't a word I can say that hasn't been said not only once, not only twice, but a hundred times before, and so I ask again: What is in the case? That too is a question asked many a time, I have no doubts in that department.The answer to the above question, at least the one most commonly cited on our dear internet. Is an interesting one. The Christian imagery of this film, namely Ezekiel 25:17 and then Jules' decision to go wherever the Lord does lead. If the theory is correct then this makes this the strangest film with a Christian message ever, what that message is, I have no idea. But the message is there to be deciphered."
7 August 2011,ShootingShark,0,2,8,The Path Of The Righteous Man Is Beset On All Sides By The Iniquities Of The Selfish And The Tyranny Of Evil Men,"Vincent and Jules are two hit men who work for bigshot Marsellus Wallace. In the space of a few days they must chaperon Mrs Wallace on a drug-fuelled night out, track down a boxer named Butch who's reneged on a promise to throw a fight, follow through on a hit which turns very messy, and thwart a hold up in a diner they're having breakfast at.Pulp Fiction is rightly hailed as a masterpiece of filmmaking, a movie which is almost jaw-dropping in its scope, intensity, originality and black humour. What impresses me most about it I think is not all the brilliant dialogue or bravura technique (although those are sensational), but just the balls it takes to make a film so daring. There are too many examples of this to mention, but to kill off your main character halfway through and then bring him back later for action which takes place previously, or to have a story which seems to be On The Waterfront but then abruptly turns into Deliverance requires real courage and vision. I can think of only a few big-budget pictures which take as many risks (say 2001). Tarantino is so confident in his storytelling abilities and so focused on every tiny element of his movie that his energy permeates on down through the cast and crew with the result that everyone does the very best work they can. The huge ensemble of players are all terrific, with Jackson stealing the show as the fiery gangster Jules, but everyone is superb, from Travolta and Thurman's goofy dance floor routine to the morbid cabbie played by Jones to Tarantino's own little turn as nervous Jimmie. There are many moments in the film which are ridiculous, but unlike many modern films which try to wink knowingly at the audience, Tarantino both pushes the absurdity to unheard of lengths but also crucially makes his actors play it as straight as they can. Hence, Butch is the most hackneyed of all stock characters - the washed-up fighter - but the way his situation is developed is utterly unique and we are riveted with his progress. A simple device like a glowing briefcase (which isn't even original, it comes from Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly) both entrances us and distracts us with Hitchcockian ingenuity whilst the director manipulates us into exactly where we should be, or floors us with another shock or razor-sharp slice of dialogue. If nothing else, Tarantino illustrates that too many directors are too timid, too conventional, too scared of doing something that will confuse or alienate an audience, instead of plundering cinema for all the artistic and entertainment value it has to offer. Trivia - the Travolta character is the brother of Mr Blonde / Vic Vega (Michael Madsen) in Reservoir Dogs. A rare example of a deserving winner of the Academy Award for Best Screenplay, and a great mad crime movie."
5 January 2015,Movie-ManDan,0,2,10,One of the Very Best Movies In History.,"Pulp Fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever. It continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it. It continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie Tarantino ever directed. People that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this. People with thorough knowledge of film love it even more. I would consider Pulp Fiction to be the best film of the 1990s, beating out other classic in that decade such as Schindler's List and Terminator 2. Like most Tarantino films, he does not put everything in chronological order. That is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end. Even those very, very, very few that don't like Pulp Fiction were obligated to stay till the end. That is also what made Tarantino's first movie, Reservoir Dogs, so thrilling. Also, Tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver. Pulp Fiction has three parallel story lines:The first deals with a couple called Ringo and Pumpkin (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) that are also thieves. They open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant. The scene is brief, but the characters and dialogue is memorable.Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), containing a golden object that is not shown nor told. Another genius movie on Tarantino's behalf. A few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs. This is probably the funniest story. Pulp Fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy. This is the story with most of its elements. This also has the one with the best and grittiest look.Soon after the incident, Vincent is asked to entertain Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), while he is out of town. They have a good time, until she overdoses on heroin that Vincent got from his drug dealer, Lance (Eric Stoltz). Although a small story, the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep. Although this is the only bit with Mia, she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films.The last is about club fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight, but after having a crazy dream, bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent. He goes on the run with his girlfriend (Maria De Medeiros) from Wallace. This is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy. Some bits are shocking, but all fit together. Bruce Willis as Butch is just as badass and heroic as John McClane. As I mentioned earlier, the all stories are done out of order, but are all tied in in a very intelligent way. Writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard, creating awesome characters is even harder, while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part. Pulp Fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved. Only Tarantino could do a movie this good."
9 May 2013,bmyze316,1,2,10,A true classic,"Pulp Fiction (1994) is the type of film you can see multiple times and still notice new things. The characters are deep and the story is enthralling. Tarantino uses discontinuity editing and the story is told out of order. Each story is told as its own movie and the details of the characters are deep. A movie about a crime boss and his hit men is sure to be filled with violence and Pulp Fiction is no exception. Scenes are murder, kidnapping, and even a homosexual rape appear in the film. Tarantino loves to push the limits and he does so in Pulp Fiction, arguably his best film."
23 February 2011,raulfaust,0,1,7,The original gratuitous violence,"I have to admit this movie has a great cast, a great cinematography, entertains and has some good conversation, but what's up? There is nothing more: just a bunch of people killing each other for no apparent reason. I now think that Michael Haneke may had been inspired by this film to make ""Funny Games"", the scene where L. Jackson kills some guys in the kitchen is very racking just like FG. Bruce Willis plot is the most interesting of them all; he steals the show with a great acting and a enviable self confidence. This is probably his best performance.So that's it, if you're looking for some free entertainment and some 150 minutes to spend, give it a try. I kind of liked but it's lack of point is a shame. Don't think you're alone if you found this movie pointless."
18 May 2006,bandw,0,1,7,A mixed bag,"A bunch of thugs, druggies, and other assorted low-lifes managed to keep my attention for most of this movie due to some sharp dialog, clever time sequencing, great acting, and a high-energy tension filled script. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) make a great pair of hit men philosophizing and quoting scripture as they go about their brutal business.Having said that, there are significant negatives. The tone is generally that of stylized movie-making fun that is not to be taken seriously. We have, for example, contrived dialog, Mia's (Uma Thurman) making gestures indicating a square that is outlined in white on the screen, references to other movies like the glowing briefcase a la ""Repo Man,"" Jack Rabbit Slim's 50s retro bar where Thurman and Travolta do a captivating twist, and so forth. But the violent scenes are disturbingly realistic and Mia's drug overdose is truly vile. I felt whip-lashed by the uneven tone. While most of the dialog is ingenious and engaging, on occasion it falls flat. I am sure that the scene where Butch's (Bruce Willis) girlfriend goes on for five minutes describing what she wants for breakfast is meant to be preciously humorous, but it had me looking at my watch. Then, for such a fast-paced movie, there are inexplicable dead zones like when Butch goes to retrieve his watch from his apartment and for several minutes we watch him park his car and walk through fences and fields before getting there. We know his destination, just jump to the apartment scene please. And would Vincent not hear Butch enter the apartment and would he not take his gun with him to the bathroom? In fact I found the Butch character uninteresting and unnecessary and the movie would have been better if he had been written out. This would have shortened the overly-long run time of 154 minutes to something more reasonable and we would have been spared the over-the-top scene with Zed, Maynard, and The Gimp as well as the homosexual rape. Perhaps the latter was an homage, in questionable taste, to ""Deliverance."" But this movie is not worried about taste. However, without Butch we might have been deprived of the hilarious scene with Christopher Walken, but for all of its significance that scene could have been tossed in almost anywhere.In summary I think this is an undisciplined, sometimes exhilarating, sometimes frustrating, original work of art. It employs a bit of a shotgun approach with more scenes hitting their targets than not."
2 October 2017,Rabical-91,0,1,9,''I'm gonna get medieval on your ass!'',"It would pointless for me to describe 'Pulp Fiction' in exact detail as the basis for the film as been extensively posted elsewhere on the net. It is probably the most popular of Quentin Tarantino's films, possibly due to the influence it had on not only other film creators but also on music groups, particularly Fun Lovin' Criminals, who used the opening sequence of the film as part of their 1996 chart hit 'Scooby Snacks'. Personally, I do not rate it as highly as Tarantino's later hit 'Kill Bill' but all the same I enjoyed it and compared to Tarantino's dreadful 'From Dusk Till Dawn', is a masterpiece.As someone far too young to have seen it on its initial release, I did not see it until I was in my teens when my family acquired a VHS copy of it. Admittedly, I found some of it too difficult to follow but I found it worth watching for the action and the presence of the stunningly beautiful Uma Thurman, who with her mid-length black hair and flexible dance moves made my heart throb ( amongst other things, pardon the expression ).Aside from the violent action, there is also a fair deal of humour on display, such as the dance sequence between John Travolta and Uma Thurman in the diner, the sight of Samuel L. Jackson's character's personalised wallet emblazoned with the slogan 'Badass Motherf**ker!' and the scene used both at the opening and closing of the film in which a couple of bandits' attempts to rob a diner are foiled.One or two scenes make for uncomfortable viewing such as Uma Thurman's character almost dying after overdosing on heroin or Ving Rhames being raped by a corrupt police officer.I have not seen 'Pulp Fiction' for some time so my review is based on my memories of it. I do remember enjoying it very much. Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis are among the best players in the film.I am not a fan of Quentin Tarantino on a personal level ( he strikes me as being something of a creep ) but one cannot deny that he is an excellent filmmaker. His next big hit came in 1997 with 'Jackie Brown' which also featured Samuel L. Jackson and in 2003 Thurman took on the lead role for the superb 'Kill Bill'.Just one thing that puzzles me about 'Pulp Fiction'. Just what was it exactly that was it in the briefcase that Travolta opened?"
3 February 2011,mligorio,1,2,9,A Facsinating Study in Human Character,"When I realized that more than 1500 reviews had been written, I thought that my own input would make little impact. Tarantino might prefer to say that it would be like 'pissing in the ocean'. But, after reading a dozen or so reviews, it became clear that many critics, even those who liked the film, don't actually understand the message of the movie. It's true that the story was well scripted, the dialog was witty and amusing, and the acting was good, but the essential theme of the film needs to be brought to light.Essentially, people are not all the same. We differ in terms of race, nationality, social status, education, and religious beliefs. These fundamental differences at times cause conflicts of interest, even wars. Nevertheless, having common ideals and sharing personal struggles serves to unite us. Tarantino tries to teach us this moral through the lives and personal experiences of his characters. In fact, each character in the story is a study of just that, character.Comparing Vincent and Jules, for example, we get the impression that Jules is the more educated of the two, nevertheless, Vincent seems knowledgeable and, moreover, he is perceptive logical thinker who can hold his own in a conversation. You may have been impressed by the simple fact that a white man and black man could be such good friends that they readily forgive one another for costly mistakes and other offenses. In fact, the two men treated each other in a manner that was almost entirely colorblind. The 'n' word didn't necessarily apply only to black people. It could apply to friend or foe and, depending on context, it could be either and insult or a compliment. But, perhaps even more impressive was the nonchalant attitude both these two men took toward their day to day job as hit men. Not only could they talk about breakfast, they could actually eat it after committing a bloody murder.It is quite remarkable how many characters in story were too interested in themselves to pause for a even moment to reflect on the many lives they destroyed. However, at least at some point, just about every important character in the story reveals to us that they indeed have a conscious. To our amusement, Vincent talks to himself in the bathroom as he tries to encourage himself to be on his best behavior with the boss's wife. Jules' actions are even more dramatic, when he risks his own life to save the man who tried to rob him.We are all searching for fulfillment in our lives. And, at times, it seems that we are desperately trying to maintain order in a world that is obviously corrupt and depraved. This common experience allows us to understand the many problems that others face, and it enables us to help one another to endure life's many hardships. This empathy is so powerful that on momentous occasions even bitter enemies can make peace. It may well be that this sense of compassion which transcends all law is what truly defines us as civilized human beings, allowing us to find meaning or purpose in our lives beyond the mundane existence of 'kill or be killed' in the so called neon jungle."
17 July 2002,rzajac,0,2,10,"Rare: A film that could, maybe, change lives. Then again, I guess not","It was a white-knuckler, for me. I don't normally go for action/suspense/suchlike, so this was a real roller-coaster. The scene where Willis returns from the ""Zed"" scene and finally has a moment of tenderness with his girlfriend before she hops on the motorcycle to split town was an incredible tension release.The most amazing thing about this movie was that I found it to have a powerful prophesy for America buried in it's dark, edgy depths. When fate (or something like fate) saves our collective ass one last time from our arguably justifiable comeuppance, are _we_ going to find ourselves reflecting upon our internalized national mythologies and searching for the truths hidden therein, as does Sam Jackson's character? Or will we blow it off and continue down the path of self-gratification at any cost and deferred self-examination, as does John Travolta's character?I think 9/11 gave us our answer; the latter, not the former, popular protestations of spiritual reevaluation and reflection notwithstanding.One arguable bit o' fat in the movie: The sequence with The Wolf and the car clean-up and all that. It either should have been left on the cutting room floor entirely or rendered down a little. This is the *only* bit that detracts from the otherwise gem-like perfection of the experience. Because of the *almost* essential segue (our Heroes escape bullets, but the hapless kid doesn't) and the time element (Jackson needing time to reflect and decide to change his life), perhaps shaving it down a bit might have been the way to go.Tarantino is a prophet and true visionary, cleverly disguised as a little American boy who never grew up; the kind that likes blowing up GI Joes in the driveway."
2 March 2018,mitsubishizero,0,2,8,Interesteing movie,"This movie is interesting due to its non-linear story telling and that's what makes it great. I like how experimental it is in how all of the stories tie into each other. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson have great chemistry and it's great to see them bounce off of each other. Jackson's monologue before carrying the hit was powerful, it was great to show how he thought of himself as a deliverer of justice. It's also cool to see Uma Thurman and Phil Lamarr too in this film. Great film, worth watching."
8 September 2004,TheNorthernMonkee,0,2,10,"Well thought out, stunning idea","SPOILERSIf a survey was to be carried out, of people's favourite directors, the odds are the list will include Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Bob Zemeckis, Alfred Hitchcock, Peter Jackson, Ron Howard and Francis Ford Coppola. If the survey was to be changed however so that people were asked to name the director they considered to define ""cool"", there's little doubt that Quentin Tarantino would be nominated for nine times out of ten. After working for a few years in a video store, Tarantino would go on to create some amazing films. Writing and directing ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), ""Jackie Brown"" (1997) and the ""Kill Bill"" films (2003 and 2004), Tarantino would become viewed as the ultimate film style guru. Whilst personally, his top film is the previously mentioned ""Reservoir Dogs"" however, to the majority of the world, his ultimate film is his 1994, Oscar Nominated, ""Pulp Fiction"".Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" tells a web of stories revolving two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson), their boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and their gangland associates. Showing this combination of stories in a different order to their chronological order, the film shows us the highs and lows as we experience a couple of days in their lives.The beauty of ""Pulp Fiction"" is simply this idea of it's order. Whilst most films are obviously designed to run in one straight story, an order where a character dies and that is the end of the actor's participation, ""Pulp Fiction"" works against the grain because the stories are connected in different ways to each other. We are shown conclusions to stories before the whole events play out (Travolta's outcome for example), and we are shown events from different points of view (Travolta and Jackson talking on one side of a restaurant whilst Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer plan their robbery across the room). This sense, almost of dramatic irony, is superb because at times we feel this awareness at events whilst at others we try to explain to ourselves why certain background surroundings happen as they do. The film, in effect, leaves us guessing until the end conclusion.Tarantino's films are always amazing because they are just so well written. In the opening scenes to ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino manages to get practically the entire films characterisation resolved through two brief arguments about Madonna and about tipping. By doing this, he gets us to know the characters before the plot even begins. In ""Pulp Fiction"" he repeats this process to a lesser effect with a random conversation between Travolta and Jackson. At the beginning of the film, these two are travelling to a job and as they go they discuss Europe and the Metric System. We learn about the characters whilst we listen to this amusing, if random, story of the French equivalent to the Quarter Pounder Burger.Finally, the other thing worth saying about ""Pulp Fiction"" is the way Tarantino manages to get such good acting performances. Whilst in ""Reservoir Dogs"" Tarantino gets superb performances out of Buscemi, Keitel, Roth and Madsen, in ""Pulp Fiction"", he manages the impossible act of rescuing John Travolta's career. In the build up to Tarantino's film, Travolta's career has practically disappeared into weak films about talking children. All this changes however when Tarantino hires him to play Vincent Vega. Putting a strong element of charisma and scepticism into Vega, Travolta puts in a career high performance and even receives an Oscar Nomination for his trouble. The film over all would receive seven Nominations in the 1995 Academy Awards, but put against some tough competition (Oscar friendly ""Forrest Gump"" and the amazing ""Shawshank Redemption""), the film comes away with only the one Oscar for the script. If the Oscar for director was given to the wrong man, there's little doubt that Travolta was worthy of the award which would end up in the hands of Tom Hanks. Travolta isn't alone however in the superb performances. Gathering a jaw dropping cast, Tarantino gets outstanding performances from fellow Oscar Nominees in the form of Uma Thurman and Samuel L Jackson, as well as Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth.Basically ""Pulp Fiction"" is a jaw dropping movie. Whilst on a personal note, Tarantino did a slightly better job on ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), any sort of major comparison between the two would be harsh. Both Fiction and Dogs deserve to be up there in a list of the all-time greats. If you've never seen either film, then you should make the time. Tarantino is a legend and in ""Pulp Fiction"" he has created a beauty."
23 October 2015,antonelos1997,4,6,10,Quentin Tarantino-pulp fiction,"Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie out of all the amazing films to come from director Quentin Tarantino. Everything about this film was brilliant an amazing cast of over 10+ well known actors. Amazing witty Dialog that has you cracking up a lot most of the conversations that go on in the movie are perfection. The gore and violence a Tarantino staple is toned done a bit from his other movies but what you get is great.The story is a trip with the plot being jumbled all over the place it makes you piece the movie together and have fun with it. The movie more or less revolves around a big time crime boss Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames) and from here we branch off into little story arcs with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson they are his hit men, Bruce Willis a guy on the run because we he was paid to throw a boxing match but didn't and Marsellus wife Uma Thurman she just wants to have a good time which ends up costing her. All the actors in this film do an amazing job even the actors with small roles they still sold it."
22 August 2015,ofpsmith,0,2,10,A clever narrative structure paired with unforgettable dialog and incredible acting make Pulp Fiction a force to be reckoned with.,"We start off Pulp Fiction seeing Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) discussing different ways that people have robbed banks and what to rob next over a meal. Shortly after wards the two stick up the café in which they are eating. Then the opening title screen appears. The first scene illustrates perfectly the tone of the movie. Interesting dialog followed by big moments. Sometimes the dialog isn't even about what happens in the next big part. There's a scene that follows the one I just talked about where hit men Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are on their way to retrieve a briefcase from four kids who stole it from Jules and Vincent's boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). There having one conversation in the car, followed by another conversation in the apartment building, followed by another conversation in the apartment building, followed by a conversation with one of the kids in the apartment itself, then we see the action. That's what makes this movie so great. The conversations followed by big moments. It also has a clever narrative structure and if you're not paying attention you could get lost because it doesn't follow time. If you haven't seen this movie yet then do it. It's worth all the effort."

                        ",The only movie I've paid to see twice. All-time classic! Spoilers,"It's tragic that Quentin Tarentino has some sort of phobia about trying to follow up Pulp Fiction with an equally brilliant film (Jackie Brown was good, though). Still, some directors only do a project every few years, but someone like Quentin needs to be more active in Hollywood considering the drek coming out every week.Pulp Fiction, which was the best film of 1994 no matter what Tom Hanks and his disciples think, stands as one of the best movies ever made. A brilliant study in the life of the lives of professional hitmen in L.A. as well as a segment of a boxer who is trying to avoid the hitmen after squelching on a deal with the hitmen's boss and then finds himself in a nightmarish situation when he bumps into the boss while trying to return to his hideout.The film goes back and forth in time (a period of a week, give or take a day), and some scenes shown earlier in the film will be played out again when other characters are in that scene. Tarentino's style of storytelling has been oft imitated.Everyone in the film delivers a superb performance, and even as despicable as some of them are, you can't help but be mesmerized by them. John Travolta and Sam Jackson shine as the hitmen; Travolta's Vinnie Vega is a heroin-addict who doesn't seem to have a code of ethics in his life, while Jackson's Jules Winnfield is a man with ethics and religious convictions who feel that he is doing good in the world. Uma Thurman is Mia Wallace, the boss' wife whose only married to him because he's money. Bruce Willis plays a boxer in the second act named Butch who was supposed to take a dive for the Boss, Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and not only didn't, but killed the man in their match, who discovers that his girlfriend didn't bring his heirloom watch to the hideout and has to get it from his apartment where Travolta is waiting to kill him. He catches Travolta in an embarrassing situation and kills him. Then when driving back, he sees the boss, who he tries to run over, but he misses and he crashes the car and the two chase and fight each other into a pawn shop where they end up being captives by two twisted homosexuals who want them for sex.In the third act, Vega and Winnfield are taking one of the small-potato criminals to have him punished by Wallace, and Vega accidentally shoots him in the head, ruining the car and bloodying their clothes. They end up having to see Harvey Keitel, who plays The Wolf to help them dispose of the body, clean the car, and get them clean clothes. Tarentino delivers a brief but explosive performance as the owner of the house where they will hide their dirty work.Finally, the first scene which features Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as Bonnie And Clyde wannabes who try to rob a diner and Winnfield, who has changed from an experience earlier in the day when they were not killed by a madman in the earlier hit, tells them that it's wrong for them to do so.With great dialogue, a superb soundtrack, and tons of memorable moments, this is a definite winner. A must see, it would take forever to talk about it's greatness. See it!"
18 November 2005,Merkin4pres64,1,2,10,"The Most Unique, Creative, and Masterful Work in the History of Cinema","""Pulp Fiction"" redefined cinema in the 20th Century and continues to do so to this day. Several films since ""Pulp Fiction"" have followed it's pattern- the inter-wining stories of several people, some films such as ""Crash,"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."" This film explores a variety of topics ranging from drugs, hit men, perverse dialog and language, and finally, one of the most intriguing topics of the entire film- the briefcase whose contents are never revealed.This film wouldn't have work if it hadn't been for the cast. The cast is absolutely perfect. All the actors fit the right part, they all do what they need to do and they all do it flawlessly. The only person I had a problem with was the character of Fabienne, but despite that setback in the film, the rest of the film makes up ten-fold for what she ruins.But when thinking of the cast, three names come to mind- John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman. All of these three were Oscar-nominated for their performances and unfortunately, didn't win.John Travolta plays hit man Vincent Vega, partner to Jules. He is a low rent for hire asked by his boss to ""take care"" of his wife which Jules mistakingly refers to as a job. Vega isn't an adventurous man, but yet his boss' wife shows him a good time when he is supposed to. But their evening together almost ends in tragedy.Uma Thurman give what is probably the strongest performance of her career, if not surpassed by The Bride in the ""Kill Bill"" movies. She is Mia Wallace, the failed television actress wife of Vince and Jules' boss, Marcellus. She is the adventurous personality that makes Vincent do stuff he normally wouldn't do. But this personality leads to almost fatal downfall.And what is there to say about Samuel L. Jackson? Much. He is Vincent's hit man partner. Jackson gives the otherwise nice Jules his sense of evil and the evil way in which he recites Ezekiel 25: 17- and for this, Jules is my favorite character in the entire movie. What Jules does is remarkable. He is able to express a temperament of sheer, vile, anger, but yet, under pressure, manages to keep his cool, even when a gun is pointed to his head. Even though many say Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were stiffed of their Oscars, in truth they were, but the greater outrage is that Martin Landau won over Samuel L. Jackson.This film is a masterpiece. You have no idea what you are missing if you don't watch this. Honestly, watch this movie and you'll see what I'm talking about."
8 August 2019,rachelrose-87356,0,0,7,Movie Review Profits,Play Pulp Fiction! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!
30 June 2000,nashcalefarms,1,2,10,last masterpiece of the millennium - ONE SPOILER,"not my favorite film of all time, but i think it is probably the last great movie of the decade. sure the movie is SUPER COOL, but it also happens to be fine filmmaking. some people cuddle up to brain candy movies like forrest gump because they think a feel good movie is the only kind of emotionally compelling type of film out there. there are other emotions to evoke besides sympathy or just plain ol' garden variety sob-fest. there are also movies which disturb you, incite you, etc. pulp fiction is such a movie. besides, it's got SUPER COOL dialogue and an ensemble cast that kicks @$$. everyone is at their best (and haven't topped those performances since, i might add, except for travolta in battlefield earth (that was supposed to be sarcastic, by the way)). bruce willis proves he can act to the world, and very well too (some of us already knew it!!). and how can you not like a movie with a scene in which a hit man slams a gigantic needle into the chest of the wife of a mob boss who has overdosed on heroine?? how can you beat that?? 10/10 all the way baby"
25 June 2005,domino1003,0,2,10,"Cheeseburgers, Foot Massages and A Mysterious Case","""Pulp Fiction"" is a incredible film by Quentin Tarantino, fresh from ""Resevior Dogs."" The film has several stories, but the common thread is Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta), hit men that work for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Jules is one cool s.o.b. Don't believe me? Catch the scene when he mentally tortures the guys that betrayed Wallace: He takes a bite out of one of the guy's burger and takes a sip of his soda, all the while getting ready to kill them! Later, Vincent takes out Mia, Wallace's wife (Uma Thurman). Vincent makes it clear that it is not a date, but you can tell that they have feelings for each other. The ""date"" ends on a low note when Mia OD's on Vincent's heroin (She being a coke head, thought it was coke). What follows is one of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Butch's story soon follows. A washed-out boxer, he earlier promised Wallace to take a dive in the ring. Butch betrays Wallace and decides to skip town with his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros). But she forgot his watch, which was an heirloom from his late father (And delivered to him when he was a boy by Christopher Walken, in one of the most not-funny-but-you-laugh-anyway scenes). Determined to get his watch Bruce ends up in a situation along with Wallace that has shades of ""Deliverance"" all over it.Other scenes throughout the film include Jules and Vincent racing the clock to clean out their car (Due to Vincent accidentally shooting a guy in the head) with the assistance of The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) before Bonnie, their friend's wife, comes home; 2 would be robbers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth)discussing the benefits of robbing a restaurant, and the mystery of the briefcase (What's in it is never revealed, but it is enough for it to glow!).Pure classic film, loaded with violence, but insightful (The discussion of cheeseburgers really is interesting, as well as the difference between particular types of foot massages!). Tarentino brings out the best work out of his cast, but it is Jackson as Jules who steals the film (His speech before he kills the guys in the apartment STILL sends shivers down my spine). Check it out!"
7 March 2012,jerrybrsc2,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction: An Exercise in Brilliance,"Before I knew what a cultural phenomenon Pulp was, I knew that this film was incredible. Seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time, I was awestruck. After seeing it, I can 100% say that it is deserving of every bit of praise it gets. Lets break this down: The acting is all top notch. Whether it's Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Eric Stoltz, Uma Thurman and even Quentin Tarantino himself, they're all perfect for their roles in every way. Whether the character the actor is portraying is loud and obnoxious or an exaggerated mousy caricature, all are on their A-Game. The story is realistic, but at the same time it's ridiculous and over the top. While this combination of seemingly incompatible story elements could be potentially disastrous in an average film, Pulp is well aware of it's absurdity and makes fun of itself to the nth degree. The fact that the film is so over the top, yet very dark at it's core is completely offset by the hilarity that comes with the situations that the characters find themselves in,(i.e. being caught and rapped by two redneck homosexuals in the Hollywood hills). The writing, in my own humble opinion, is some of the best ever produced. Period. Whether the dialog is an exchange between two characters talking about rats, milk, or a Royale With Cheese, every word spoken is genuine and real and horribly hilarious in it's nature. You, as an audience member know that you shouldn't be laughing at what's happening on screen, but the film's sly whit is infectious and it keeps you smiling and guessing until the end of the film. Some people call Pulp Fiction ""a movie about a movie"". I can't argue their point; Pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70's, as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. Some people see this as a weakness to Quentin Tarantino's direction, saying that he's limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. I don't think that's true, personally, but in my opinion it's one of his strengths. He takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. He did that with Pulp and he continues to do it today, with films like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. Boiling Pulp Fiction itself down however, the true lovers of cinema, the people who will know exactly what Tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. That is however not to say that casual viewers won't like the film. It has a little something for everybody and is, without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. I hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film."
11 June 2014,koldan-24-530508,4,6,10,Great,"Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La Joete. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic."
20 September 2016,tankace,0,1,10,Quentine Tarantino best story arc ever.,"Pulp Fiction is not doubt one of the most interesting film ever made and has a devout following from around the world that has memorized every quote, scene and insult in it. To be fair the film has only one flaw at times it is a little slow, there is the only flaw that I found, you d**less pieces of s**ts. No let's talk in a more civilized way and you to the bathroom the take away the pressure.As for the story, better call them stories we follow two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits as their activities are intertwine while they are doing their work, organize their crimes and generally continue their lives and then all goes to hell as they try to get out from their situations as quickly as possible. There is the summary in the movie for you.Now to the good stuff :The dialogues are funny, interesting, thought provoking and in a matter of minutes flesh out the character's ideals, philosophy and well character. This has become as stable of all Tarantino movie ever since Reservoir Dogs ,but here we see it become the awesomeness we all know and love.Secondary is the dark comedy in the film for we see murders, accidents and all kinds of criminal activities and yet we see it all played out as a day that work for out multiple protagonist. If you think about it, as plumier has got used to cleaning the excrement of our fellow humans and the smell has no affect on him ,it is the same thing.Last and not least is the time line of the events in the movie, which are like a broken puzzle and for decades fans have tried to put them in a chronological order. As for what Tarantino himself is thinking about the themes and time-line of the movie he said ""I will say nothing fan of the movie can theorize themselves what are them themes and ideals in the film ,why ruin their fun?"".In short every hypothesis (not theory of theories are confirmed by fault, sorry my science rand again(!)) about it are right so everyone can enjoy in his or her own way the flick.In summary Pulp Fiction is the film which together with L.A. Confidetial (1997), Leo the Professional (1994) and the Usual Suspects(1995),Seven (1005) and Fargo(1996) (always from my P.O.W.) brought the neo -noir sub-genre of cinema in the modern day audience. A much watch for every one in the end."
18 August 2009,Jackpollins,0,2,10,The greatest thing a human has ever done,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that works perfectly as a comedy, a crime movie, a thriller, a drama, a romance, an action film, and a mystery all mashed into one. It's four connecting tales of a hit-man named Vincent (John Travolta), a gangster's wife named Mia (Uma Thurman), a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis), a man named Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and diner bandits named Lance and Jody (Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette). It connects perfectly, Vincent falls for Mia, Butch knows Vincent, and Jules, Lance, and Jody- well see the end for yourself. The movie is a masterpiece, only a genius can think of this stuff. This movie is violent, brutal, sickening, and I love it. In fact, I can't see how anyone can hate this. Never has a movie been so perfectly done. Never has someone done such flawless work. It manages to be a great crime movie that is also funny and poignant (yes, it's extremely poignant). The movie has great potential, and uses it to its fullest extent. It's such a good movie, it's almost mind blowing how good it is. A movie of this caliber can only be summed up in four words: best movie ever made."
27 August 2007,Meven_Stoffat,0,3,10,"You hear that, hillbilly boy??? I""m gonna get Medieval on yo' ass!","Quentin Tarantino's second movie, Pulp Fiction is easily his best, without any question. It has Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, and many of Hollywood's most memorable names.Now there are 3 story lines, so here they are: 1. MARCELLUS WALLACE AND HIS WIFE: Centered around Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, Marcellus Wallace is away in Florida, leaving Vincent to take his sexy wife Mia out on a date. Mia and Vincent go out on a date, and a few minutes after arriving at home, Mia overdoses with hilarious results! 2. THE GOLD WATCH: After Butch Coolidge wakes up from dreaming about a gold watch that his dad's friend gave him, he is ready for a fight. After killing his opponent, Butch rides in a cab to a motel, where his beautiful French girlfriend Fabienne sleeps. The next day, he discovers that the gold watch is gone, and goes back to the apartment, but ends up killing someone we were introduced to in the process (he gets the watch, nonetheless). On his way back, he encounters a sticky situation with Marcellus...3. THE BONNIE SITUATION: Whilst at an apartment getting the briefcase, Vincent and Jules are shot at... but the bullets don't hit him! They call this as a ""Miracle"", and leave. But in the car, Vincent accidentally blows Marv's head off, with hilarious results! After getting yelled at by Jimmie Dimmick for bringing the body in, and having a problem solver named Winston Wolf come in, they clean the car, get rid of the body at a Monster truck place, and encounter a sticky situation at the Diner in the opening scene of the film, where two robbers will execute anyone if they move.Pulp Fiction is an unforgettable film. At 155 minutes running time, it keeps us entertained for the entire duration. If you haven't seen this, see it now!"
24 October 2011,kylehaines96,0,1,10,And You Will Kow My Name Is The Lord When I Lay My Vengeance Upon Thee!,"Director Quentin Tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film Pulp Fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what I think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next.The first story titled Vincent Vega And Marcellus Wallaces' Wife follows Vincent Vega played by John Travolta who is told by Marcellus Wallus played by Ving Rhames to take care of his wife Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman. They go to a 50's style restaurant titled Jack Rabbiit Slims where the famous twist contest happens. The story really escalates when Mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot. Fun Fact: the scene with Vincent sticking the needle in Mia was done by having John Travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in He would have broken Uma Thurmans Ribs.The Second Story titled The Gold Watch is about famous boxer Butch Coolidge played by Bruce Willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent. He and his girlfriend Fabienne played by Maria De Medeiors who are on the run by Marcellus Wallace. They eventually get kidnapped and get sexually assaulted by 2 psychos Zed played by Peter Greene and Maynard played by Duane Whitaker. Butch ends up stealing Zeds Chopper saying the famous line, Zeds Dead Baby, Zeds Dead. The Third And Final Story Titled The Bonnie Situation is about Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield played by Samuel L Jackson who end up killing their friend named Marvin played by Phil LaMarr and end up going to their friend Jimmies house played by Quenton Tarantino and get help from Winston Wolf played by Harvey Keitel to clean up the mess before Bonnie played by Pam Grier. They End up going to a diner which is being robbed by Pumpkin played by Tim Roth and Honey Bunny played by Amanda Plummer. This is my favorite of the 3 stories.Filled with crafty dialouge excellent story telling and great cast of characters this will always remain one of my all time favorite films. I definitely recommend this work of art.Rated R For Strong Graphic Violence And Drug Use, Pervasive Strong Language And Some Sexuality.2hrs 34min/154min.275 uses of the F-word.****/****"
1 October 2014,tkoeste,4,6,10,"Great Director, Great Movie","Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that Pulp Fiction, one of his most well recognized and known movies, is one of the best movies of all time. Between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that Tarantino used for the movie, it is inarguable otherwise. For many people, for instance some of my friends who have watched Pulp Fiction, the plot is a negative. These people have got to be Type A's who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. They usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. The movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name, background or insight into the character. These two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. In the beginning, when the ""Honey-Bunny"" scene is introduced for the first time, it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. The audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when Marsellus Wallace is talking to Butch. There are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. The audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is Marsellus Wallace and that Butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. It is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a Type A personality. To me, however, this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of Pulp Fiction. Movies are too predictable today. They present too many known and common variables. All of Quentin Tarantino's movies, or at least most are unpredictable. This unpredictability is refreshing. The randomness, especially in Pulp Fiction, is positive, new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. Much of the randomness factor in Pulp Fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. An example of this is when Vince and Mia are on the date and Mia calls Vince a square. But rather than saying square, she outlines a square with her fingers in the air, and lines follow her fingers on the screen. Another random yet comedic part of the movie is when Butch comes home to his girlfriend Fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. This is where the audience first learns that Fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. Besides these two scenes, there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. An excellent example of this is when Butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead father's comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. Of course the vocabulary Tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar, but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. The actors are also part of what makes Pulp Fiction as good a movie as it is. Tarantino usually uses many of the same actors, especially Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. Thurman plays Mia and Walken plays a more minor role. Besides Thurman and Walken, many acting greats including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson take major roles. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have seen Bruce Willis play in as he does not play some cheesy, cliché character with cliché lines like in all the Die Hard movies. John Travolta also plays his role very well, as he also does not take himself too seriously. Samuel L. Jackson, in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. His violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous ""Go the _____ to Sleep."" Pulp Fiction also leaves the audience with questions. The biggest question is what is in the suitcase. All that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that Marsellus Wallace is the owner and needs them back. The audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought that the content was gold bars, which may explain the orange glow that hits characters' faces when they opened up the suitcase. But, after investigation on the internet, unaware that the subject was of hot debate, I learned that Tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds, but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. It is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. Because of the actors, hilarity, and mystery in Pulp Fiction, it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. He intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies."
1 June 2015,luke-a-mcgowan,0,2,9,Who knew a bunch of hit men could stand around and talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages and still make for fascinating cinema?,"Pulp Fiction is apparently named for the low quality paper Tarantino wrote his screenplay on. All I can say is thank you low quality paper for providing one of the top 30 finest films of the 1990s and may this film's endurance pay eternal homage to you. Now lets dig into the good stuff.Pulp Fiction's non-linear story really boggled and irritated me the first time I watched it, but now I can't go without it. What on earth happened between the second scene, where Vince and Jules were so calmly in control, and third scene, where they rock up wearing loose fitting t shirts and boxer shorts. What on earth is the purpose of Ringo and Yolanda? Keep watching. Why was Vincent all alone in Butch's room? Keep watching. The strategic placement of The Bonnie Situation is pure gold, because when we watch Jules' decision to retire, we have already seen the trials, tribulations and ultimate tragedies that befall Vincent without him.You can look through IMDb's list of alternative casting choices for this movie, and whilst some may intrigue you, this movie would be completely different (and in my view worse) without Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Keitel, Plummer, Roth and even Tarantino himself in the lead roles. Every single one of them embodies their character and we could not go without them. John Travolta is a sleazy, drug-addicted hit-man who is one hell of a dancer. Uma Thurman is equally good in as the alluring and composed boss' wife as she is in her overdose scene (which I maintain is one of the best put to screen). For Samuel L. Jackson, this is his moment - every single line he puts to screen is a quotable moment, and everything form his sculpted facial hair to his costume design becomes part of one of the most iconic characters of the 90s. It is one of 1994's greatest crimes that Jackson lost the Oscar to Martin Landau. No one stands around quoting Bela Lugosi, but you bet your sweet ass they can quote Ezekial 25:17 in almost its entirety.But boy does this screenplay sound great. Who knew a bunch of hit men could stand around and talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages and still make for fascinating cinema. The banter between Travolta and Jackson is gold. The confrontation with Brett is cinematic platinum. Tarantino is just so good with words. The screenplay not only eventful, but packed full of non-traditional events that there never will be a film like Pulp Fiction again. Who'd have thought to throw in a pawn store rapist into the chase scene between Wallace and Butch? Tarantino, that's who.I will not profess Pulp Fiction to be a perfect film. Its not. The banter between Butch and his girlfriend isn't nearly as entertaining as the rest of the film and I think it about ten minutes of footage could've been cut from that story. I also never really understood the point of the Wolf, because he is called in to fix a problem that really shouldn't be that hard to fix. But they are small problems in a classic film and I won't dwell on them anymore.Pulp Fiction is special, its classic and if you haven't seen it, I'll buy you a DVD and send it to you so I can claim charity work. That this and the equally masterful Shawshank Redemption lost to Forrest Gump at the Oscars is so unjustifiable that its almost funny. Almost, but not quite."
12 February 2014,higherall7,0,0,7,A Study in Scatology,"President Regan once was quoted as saying you can't argue with success and the Honorable Elijah Muhammud was represented by Spike Lee as telling Malcolm X to keep his mouth shut about a man who has won the love of the people. This seems like sound advice to me, but the time has come at last to give my two cents about a film known as PULP FICTION. There are those who hate it and those who love it and those who shrug their shoulders not knowing quite what to make of it. I freely admit I belong to the third category. I don't revere it, I don't condemn it; and the way Quentin Tarantino bookends the movie with the beginning scene is kind of clever and interesting. But I sure don't see what all the hoopla is about. The stuff packed in between the two slices of narrative bread is not god awful or gems of shimmering brilliance, it's just standard shock-o-rama to me. I didn't mind watching it and would not mind watching it again except for all this undue emphasis on how important it is to Film Culture. I hope you will forgive me for not seeing it that way.PULP FICTION is a cultural curiosity to me. Sort of like the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. I can think of half a dozen films I can more easily and wholeheartedly embrace and which more naturally duplicate my thoughts and feelings and deeply felt ideas. When I first saw PULP FICTION, I was hoping at the end of the roundup there would be some kind of moral resonance to the whole thing, but it was simply too shallow to produce that kind of effect. It's more like a hodgepodge of cultural references, nearly all of which veer in the direction of the scatological. Some of the references hit an emotional chord and some don't in my mind.I remember seeing LET IT BE with my friend Scott in Black Lake, Michigan. This was a documentary about the Beatles. I found the picture exhilarating because of how it recorded the incubatory introversion of the creative process the band went through before experiencing the celebratory extroversion of live performance. Scott did not think there were enough exciting parts to hold his interest. I also remember seeing Fellini's AMARCORD with Louie Whitehead and realizing while mentally comparing it to about a hundred films in a few seconds how remarkable it was that it did not focus on Sex and Violence to carry the story forward. That being so, Louie was kind of dissatisfied with it and I confessed I did not think as highly of AMARCORD as I did of Fellini's THE CLOWNS. All I can say is that different people of necessity have different tastes and sensibilities.My dissatisfaction with PULP FICTION is that unlike Kurosawa's film HIGH AND LOW there is no 'high and low'! All the characters are lowlifes, but represented as strong and resourceful while the so-called 'straight types' like the college students are represented as ineffectual and weak. PULP FICTION completes the moral and cultural inversion first presented by Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER, but this time played even more for laughs. I just don't see much value in all of this.I suppose if Ned Beatty could be sodomized in DELIVERANCE, owing to equal opportunity Ving Rhames could be sodomized in PULP FICTION, but the truth is I would rather see him play someone like A.G. Gaston, than someone like Al Capone. I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis chose between a chain-saw and a katana before rescuing Rhames' character from the pommel horse, but even he comes across as a character of dubious honor.Perhaps, I should not quibble about the Whore with the Heart of Gold now being joined by the Hit-man with the Heart of Gold. It is just that Divine Intervention for hired killers is too perverse and cruel a Cosmic Joke for me.Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play fascinating characters as Jules and Vincent, but they seem more like supporting characters than leads. My problem with PULP FICTION is that there did not seem to be any character, except for a few moments with Bruce Willis, I could wholeheartedly relate to and embrace. All of them, one way or another, seemed to be stained with sleaze or wallowing in it. Uma Thurman gives a creditable performance as the wife of Marsellus Wallace and Christopher Walken's off-color story is hilarious, but it all comes across as a world you want to handle in a glove or a puzzle box so as not to get any of it on you. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer (bearing the name of a character in one of my three-act plays, by the way) depart a Mexican standoff against Jules and Vincent with their lives and all their ill-gotten gains, but are they really any the wiser? Leaving, they come across as an ersatz version of Adam and Eve exiting the Garden of Evil rather than Eden.Much has been made of the non-linearity of the narrative structure and no doubt something can be learned from Tarantino's musical handling of his scenes. This leads me to conclude you can get people to believe and accept anything just by making the images flow in harmony with the musical score. Once again, it seems to me I have seen non-linearity handled better in other pieces, most notably and recently in RUN, LOLA, RUN, but Tarantino does a good job with it here. It is just when it comes time to deliver the moral of the story, PULP FICTION seems to come up with insufficient funds."
8 March 2013,illbebackreviews,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction IMO- Best movie of 1990's and best movie of the century!,"To call 'Pulp Fiction' a great movie is simply said, not a fair judgment. Pulp Fiction is so much more than a movie and back in its release year, there had never really been a movie like 'Pulp Fiction' apart from perhaps Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that was his directorial debut 'Reservoir Dogs' To describe 'Pulp Fiction' is like truly describing why you love chocolate. The plot to the movie is not easy to explain but simplistic to watch and understand. Apart from such stylistic choices made by Quentin Tarantino that involves using music that adds to the tone of the movie, Quentin Tarantino's writing is far superior to any director working today. The dialogue in 'Pulp Fiction' is what I believe to be the greatest dialogue in cinematic history. It is easy for anyone to say, ""Wow! I could do that. It isn't hard!"" but reallyNo man on Earth could use such entertaining dialogue in what is basically a dialogue based movie. There was not a minute of dialogue that bored me in the morning. The dialogue was harsh, it was hilarious, it was brutal, it was classical and yet, it was so clever. 'Pulp Fiction', turning 18 years old this year still has people that love this movie and even to this day, people repeat quotes from the movie. That's how catchy the dialogue is. The story is that based around two mob men who come across a hard day whilst trying to deliver something to his boss, a boxer whose life becomes at stake after a boxing match, a story of the mob leader, a story where one of the two mob men must take out the gangster's wife on a date and a story based around the opening scene, which is the restaurant robbery. Pulp Fiction is NOT an action movie nor is it a comedy. It has elements of both but Tarantino is a master at blending elements from certain movies he particularly loves. The characters in this movie are all fantastic, with one of my favourite characters being the Wolf! I just love that guy and Harvey Keitel really is amazing in that role. However, without a doubt the scene stealer in the movie is Samuel L Jackson as the amazing Jules Winnfield who steals the last 30-45 minutes of the movie. Seriously, that part 'The Bonnie Situation' feels like a 10 minute scene. That isn't to say the rest of the acting is mediocre. That's just harsh. John Travolta as Jackson's sidekick in this movie is superb and is the other scene stealer, Bruce Willis as Butch is brilliant, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace is surprisingly perfect, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as the restaurant robbers are great as is every single member of the cast including director Quentin Tarantino in his cameo. The movie, at a run time of 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) did not at any moment bore me which is amazing considering that I must pause the film at a time to look at how much I've seen. This movie was not like that, I sat down and before I knew it, the film was over! That's how amazingly paced and how entertaining the movie is with only a few gunshots and minimal violence presented in the movie. If you're looking for a big bloody action movie, check out Tarantino's Kill Bill, but Pulp Fiction most certainly will disappointment those looking for big action movies To conclude this review here, it is almost factual and not opinion based in saying that 'Pulp Fiction' is easily one of the greatest movies ever made with almost no flaw at all with perhaps the greatest writing, one of the greatest stories and characters and brilliantly and flawlessly acted. The movie, at an immense 150 minutes kept me going through the whole movie staring in awe at how amazing this movie is- That is being said from a person who is watching this movie for his third time."
2 September 2016,PetarNeo,0,1,10,Brilliant movie,"Quentin showed the world his power and capability with Reservoir Dogs and lifted it up with Pulp Fiction. Brilliant and clever writing makes his movies one of the best in the world. Characters are deeply developed and dialogues that they spoke are just prefect. There is not a one part of movie that shouldn't be there, from simple car scenes and talk to some even more where he cites Bible or so better to say changes some part but keeps us in believe that it's real. Stories combining is just immaculately as he keeps plot flowing and adding every detail that we need. All people from Travolta to L Jackson to Willis are superb in their acting skills. Two most memorable scenes created by this movie are popular even today and will keep to be even in distant future no doubt. All talk and motion that movie created is so powerful that not even QT imagined that would happen. Briefcase and theories about it have changed everything about film making. So much movies are made but non of them keep the intensity as good as Tarantino movies, they move people to talk and discuss even things that are visually created on screen and shown to audience. Not a lot directors can say that about themselves. Every role in movie counts and has some kind of meaning and is put there because of something. Absolutely brilliant, intelligent and masterfully created movie. 4/4"
21 November 2008,pinkliz41,0,1,10,"Without a doubt, one of the most classic films ever made.","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review: Regarded as one of the greatest films in history, Pulp Fiction has redefined movie history forever. Quentin Tarantino, the master behind the epic has directed a film with a sounding beat and an uncompromising tempo. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samual L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette all give the greatest performances of their careers.Its hard to ever forget Pulp Fiction, every substance and detail are perfected to an over perfect film. The classic and timely epic acting play one of the biggest sectors in the film. Every scene is loaded with substance and coolness from beginning to end. The story though very simple throws elements and greatness to new levels.Verdict: An unforgettable masterpiece. Coolly directed and inch perfectly acted from all members. Tarantino has landed himself as a master of the modern epic"
13 May 2014,dpm12,1,2,9,One of the greatest films ever!,"Pulp Fiction is a classic and a masterpiece. I feel like it is a privilege to have been born one month after this wonderful film's release. I think the style of non-linear storytelling is genius, it just wouldn't be the same film if the stuff was in order. The story is awesome. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hit men who work for mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), who arrive at an apartment to pick up a briefcase that was stolen from their boss. They execute them and take one of the men named Marvin (Phil LaMarr) with them. As their driving down the road, they accidentally hit a bump, causing the gun to go off, and Vincent accidentally blows Marvin's head off. The two go to Jules' friend Jimmie's (Quentin Tarantino) house, who warns them to hurry up and clean, because his wife will return from work in 90 minutes. Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) helps them clean out the car, and the take the car to a junkyard to be disposed of. Jules and Vincent then decide to have breakfast, when the diner they are in is being robbed by Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). Jules foils the robbery, and he and Vincent leave to return Marsellus' briefcase to him.That night, Vincent takes out Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) for a good time, and they eat dinner at Jack rabbit Slim's, a restaurant. Later that night, she overdoses and Vincent takes her to the house of his drugdealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) where they give her an adrenaline shot and save her. They agree to keep this secret from Marsellus.Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) has been paid by Marsellus to lose his next fight, but he wins anyway, and now Marsellus is looking for him. He and his girlfriend hide in a hotel room, but Butch decides to go back to his apartment, knowing very well the gangsters could be there, to get his watch. He kills Vincent while there, and encounters Marsellus. The two end up fighting in a pawn shop, where Marsellus ends up getting raped, and Butch saves him. Marsellus agrees to let Butch go free, and Butch and his girlfriend leave Los Angeles.The script is amazing, some of the best writing I have ever heard in a film, the acting is great, the story is cool, and, most of all, the film is entertaining.One of the best films I have ever seen, and my 6th favorite film.4/4"
20 September 2013,samlynn12,1,2,10,Masterpiece,"There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same.The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!"
14 August 2014,tomerspector1,1,1,9,"A great movie, Tarantino's masterpiece","Clearly Tarantino has no border when it comes to violent, but in this movie he shows us that beside all the blood and gore, we stand before a director who can think of such colorful Characters, a wonderful writer, every scene is action-packed, with great phrases that will be embed in pop culture for a long, long time, a wonderful soundtrack.The plot is difficult to follow but after you watch the movie a few times, you will become a Tarantino addict. The actors are great, Travolta shows us that he is more than a pretty face and dancer, Samuel l. Jackson proves that he can do more than small parts like in Jurassic park, Bruce Willis show us that he is a real action movies god, and we see that Tim Roth, well is Tim Roth and in this movie he can do more than lie down the entire movie.One thing that i loved in the movie is the ""SUITCASE"", no one' not even Tarantino, knows what there is in the suitcase, i've heard many opinions about the content of this suitcase, and every opinion is crazier than the other, the only clues we have about the content of this black suitcase is a strange glow coming out of it and the combination for it ""666"" the devil's numberthis movie look, sound and feels great, this movie is recommended for every one who want a classic action movie"
9 December 2019,John0711,1,2,10,Analysis of Pulp Fiction,"I love the opening scene of this movie because the two robbers plot what they are gonna do for their next robbery and right then and there they start to rob the place. But what I like most about this scene is how casual they are and happy and then they go full robbers and pull out their guns. I like how when the women says ""Ill execute every motherf**cking last one of you"" then the shot freezes on her and then they start on the opening credits.
I like how in movies when the shot starts off dark then whatever it is that the characters are behind opens then you see the characters. In Pulp Fiction the shot starts dark then the trunk opens and you get a low angle shot. The camera is in the trunk shot up at the Vincent and Jules getting their guns out of the trunk.
Tracking shot is used when Vincent and Jules walk to the apartment.
When Jules and Vincent enter the apartment the movie uses close shots of the characters faces so the audience understands the atmosphere of the conversation.
Mia calls Vincent a square without actually saying it. She moves her hand to make a square and the effects of movie makes a square. I like this editing technique, it different and something you don't see in most movies.
One of the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is because Quentin Tarantino did a very good job at making me confused. Throughout the movie I had no idea what was really going on but as the movie went on you understood how the scenes connected to eachother."
1 December 2019,Svenstadt,0,1,7,"Too much of Tarantino's humor, and short on substance.","It would be hard to call this a bad movie because it isn't. I find it to be much overrated, just on account of all the trendy, popular sentiment the film contains, which are plentiful in Tarantino movies, from his silly lines he wrote for Crimson Tide, to other things. The movie is chock full of cliches and recurrent motifs: from Marcellus Wallace always getting raped constantly, to Butch's good luck, to Vincent Vega (John Travolta) always being in the bathroom when something important happens, to Jules Winfield's (Samuel L. Jackson) moving sermons which seemingly summons supernatural deliverance for him. Even still, the pacing is uneven. The movie ends where it began, in the diner. This is effective, but I felt in watching it that they do certain things merely for the shock value. People know that naughty things sell well. It is done so well, however, that you quickly realize how good the movie was. The downside is that you are unsure whom to sympathize with. These are all very bad people, and none of them really grow into characters to either villify or root for. For example, when Vincent Vega dies, you want to laugh, since he dies on the toilet, being knocked back by the recoil of the gun. It's pretty funny when the toaster pops, then he gets blasted! But you don't know what to think or feel anywhere in this movie. This movie contains just a series of victims on an on-again, off-again roller coaster. I don't see the need to ever see this again, because it simply tells a story and doesn't elicit any sympathy at all. If anything, the person you should feel sorry for, Marcellus, isn't given enough screen time and isn't the main character. The main plot is the briefcase, which, some have said, contains Marcellus's very soul. This seems pretty silly as a plot point since this is a guy ordering hits constantly and getting raped repeatedly.
The title pretty much says it all in the beginning definition of the word: it is Pulp Fiction."

14 November 2016,tiskec,0,1,9,The Best Cluster **** To Date!,"This has to be the best movie about a cluster f*ck chain of events involving a kingpin multimillionaire Marcelous Wallace, and his ""employees."" Each one of the employee's stupid actions gets them in some kind of jam. For instance Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is expected my Mr. Wallace to take his wife out for a good time, while he's away on business, rigging a boxing match with Butch the boxer (Bruce Willis). After they get back from dancing at a weird 1950's style restaurant, she finds what she thinks is cocaine in Vincent's coat pocket while he's using their bathroom. She makes lines up and snorts it. Little does she know is grade ""A"" heroin. So, obviously she O.D.s. So he rushes her drugged up body over to his dealers house and they give her a shot of adrenaline into her heart, bringing her back to normal instantly. It is just crazy. Something you'd have to watch.While Marcelous and Butch are at the boxing match, Butch kills the opponent boxer, when he was supposed to go down in the fourth. Now Butch has all this money and is running from Marcelous and his mobsters now. I'll just say they ""shake and make up"" after Butch rescues him from this male rapist cop, while he was getting abused in the basement of this weapons shop. Yeah...this is just the minimum of the crazy sh*t in this movie.I would definitely recommend this movie to any audience. It supplies a little bit of everything. All the acting is good, and the dialog is outstanding. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again."
9 May 2012,rebecca-ry,0,1,9,A Modern Classic,"'Pulp Fiction' is seen as a modern classic. It scores 9/10 here because it really is a great film, it makes you laugh on more than one occasion and can become extremely violent within seconds.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the best characters in the plot, their dialogue with each other is hilarious. Jackson's monologues can be really frightening and he proves just how great an actor he is. Their part in the film is also probably the most violent. Bruce Willis' part is very brief but, again it can be quite funny and extremely graphic. It's difficult to tell whether he is good at acting in this film because he's pretty much playing Bruce Willis, he can play a different character in other films but his 'tough-guy' approach is also effective, it particularly suits this role well. Travolta and Uma Thurman's section is also very short but is incredibly well done, not just by the actors but by Tarantino's direction too. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth's short screen appearances are also very well written, their almost comic performances work great in this film.Overall, the plot can be confusing, you see characters die and then a few chapters later they're alive. Tarantino sets it out in a random order but at the end it will all make sense, this can put off some people and can make the film less enjoyable but the content of each 'chapter' keep you entertained and are genuinely interesting. The dialogue is, as is usually the case with Tarantino's work, very life-like. How he manages to get conversations in film so realistic and natural is amazing. The soundtrack is also really good, in some scenes it really adds either humour or dramatic effect.Overall, I would strongly recommend this film, it is a classic. If you've never seen a Tarantino film this would be a good place to start."
5 June 2017,scyyoung,2,3,10,10/10 Stars,"Pulp Fiction is a pop cultural icon that deserves 5/5 stars. Tarantino is so good at the techniques he utilizes which include non chronological events, dialogue, and a Macguffin throughout the course of the film. These techniques add an effect not many other films add which divulge the viewer and graphs them close to the plot and story line throughout the film.Pulp Fiction utilizes a Macguffin throughout the film which is a briefcase that heavily drives the plot and the respective characters and becomes so sought after but we never get the luxury as to see what it is that drives everyone and everything around them. We know this is a macguffin as it drives the plot and is crucial to the overall story line and drives all motives but we never understand exactly what it is.Pulp Fiction carefully constructs a non-chronological story line that is essential to the plot but seems unusual at first. This is a cool and creative directorial technique but there seems to be a method behind the madness. Tarantino utilizes a non-chronological sequence of events to tell a story using a vastly different method. Tarantino utilizes this technique to tell the story in a more entertaining way and makes the taste after the film that much better due to the fact that the end is pretty much in the middle of the film and we have no idea and so key events in the film are told at an immaculate time such as Vincent's death. Pulp Fiction uses various techniques of dialogue to convey the meaning of something, foreshadow something, and set a tone throughout Pulp Fiction not used in many other films. Dialogue is a very important factor utilized vigorously throughout the entirety of the the film. Dialogue used throughout isn't used to drive the story rather than to establish a mood and set the scene. Sometimes at first listen some conversations such as the fast food conversation between Jules & Vincent, but nothing throughout the movie is said for no reason behind every word/sentence is a meaning, such as relating back to the fast food conversations gets followed by a foot massage conversation which During their interrogation is brought up as Marcellus had a man throw out of a window for giving his wife a for massage establishes the following scene where Vincent takes Marcellus's wife out on a date, so while the conversations are happening they might seem meaningless but later or maybe prior knowledge will explain what that conversation meant and why it was said. The theme of Pulp Fiction is as simple as these things happens and all characters that are so different and wouldn't expect anything more than a passing glance happen to all intertwine with one another and all of the core characters either get 'saved' or 'save' someone which is ironic due to the fact all of them are somehow involved with criminal activity. Marcellus is saved from getting raped, Vincent saves the gangster's wife. Furthermore the use of various film techniques Tarantino utilizes throughout the course of Pulp Fiction seemingly make 'main' characters turn into an 'extra' or non essential character and he makes the transformation seeming less. The macguffin, non chronological sequence of events, and camera angle/lens create an entire modern day atmospheric presence that indulges you into the story, which is told out of order, and forces you the viewer to really immerse yourself into the film which is why I would say Pulp Fiction deserves a 5/5 and commend Quentin Tarantino on this film."
27 November 2011,unklechunkle,1,2,10,"Really cannot praise this film enough in words, but i'll try!","Breathtaking. Mesmerising. Shocking. Brilliant. These are just a handful of words you can use to describe Pulp Fiction, without doubt one of the best movies of modern cinema.Describing its non-linear plot is tricky, it has to be seen to be fully comprehended. Basically, Pulp Fiction is really three different stories, two hit men and an eventful morning trying to deliver a mysterious briefcase to their boss, another is one of these hit men (Vincent Vega played by John Travolta) taking the boss' wife out to dinner to keep her company while he is out of town, and the third is an experiences boxer trying to earn some big bucks before retiring with his girlfriend.The brilliant thing about the plot is the fact that it is presented out of chronological sequence and at times, from different perspectives. Dramatic biblical monologues are repeated threefold and we see characters who have died in a previous scene reappearing in the next scene. Combined with this is the sublime screenplay written by Tarantino is perhaps the best ever committed to film. With defining performances from John Travolta, Samueal L Jackson and Uma Thurman as well as Bruce Willis only add to the film's brilliance."
12 March 2020,Mnemosyne15,0,0,8,"Everyone is the protagonist of their own lives, and also the supporting role of others' lives. You will never know what happens in the next moment.","The film uses five separate segments to show us the story in a non-narrative manner from multiple angles. At first glance, the five segments seem to have no connection. This is not the case.Each story is closely linked to each story. And each story has the protagonist of each story. In other people's stories, you can only be a trivial passer-by by chance. In your world, you are your own protagonist, but you cannot do whatever you want, because you cannot leave the big world. In the big world, everyone is a small role, and no one is the real protagonist.At the beginning of the film, the couple intends to rob the restaurant as if everything is under their control.At the end of the film, he returned to the restaurant, but at this time the protagonist has become Jules, and the little couple has become a stepping stone for the self-redemption of the gang member Jules.For another example, when the killer Vinson was with Martha's wife Mia, they danced and twisted to get the trophy, as if the world were revolving around them.But in a blink of an eye, the gold medal killer Vinson was shot by the most familiar gun in Boxer's Butch chapter.The film uses the restaurant story as the beginning and the end, not only because the restaurant fragment is at the center of all the fragments, but also because Jules and Vinson have different views on not being shot at close range, which ultimately leads to their fate. Different.In the restaurant, Jules thought that this miracle was God's guide to him, and he decided to wash his hands in a golden basin. Vinson only thought it was a weird coincidence. When Vinson went to the toilet, a little couple in the restaurant robbed the restaurant with a gun, but they met a killer who often killed someone with a gun. The little couple was quickly controlled by Jules. But Jules did not kill them. He had decided to rehabilitate, so he let the little couple away and even gave them his money.After the timeline after the luggage was delivered, we did not see the group Jules again. When delivering the luggage, the arrogant Vinson annoyed the boxer Butch. Butch missed the fake punch and was chased by the gangster. To kill, Vincent was sent to monitor Butch's home, but he was shot dead when Butch returned home to collect his gold watch.Although they are all killers, one likes the Bible, one loves vulgar novels, one believes in the miracles of God, one thinks weird coincidence, one is humble, one is arrogant, and two attitudes determine two destinies. In the end one wandered around to help others, and one died of arrogance in the grab of someone else and went to extinction.The accidental factor, the attitude to life, and the living environment determine the inevitable fate of a person. Maybe you think that small things that are not important often involve or even determine your fate."
26 July 2021,HollisWoods,0,0,9,Iconic & fun,"This is such a fun movie to not just watch, but to break down given how layered the film is. I'm not promising this to be a full on analysis of Pulp Fiction, but I will share any thoughts I have had after watching this movie a few times.The movie starts of with a dictionary definition of 'Pulp Fiction,' saying a pulp fiction is ""characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper."" Knowing the characters, the title now seems quite fitting. The pace and irony is set up brilliantly in the opening dining scene. You have a lovely young couple having a casual conversation about crime, and the scene ends with them starting a crime with upbeat music leading into the credits. That's pretty much the tone of the entire movie. You become attached to these nice people who are actually very horrible criminals and everything is so energetic and fun but with a serious undertone beneath.As this movie is told in clear cut story segments, the 2nd segment is probably the most iconic as we're introduced to Vincent & Jules, played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Again with the irony, we follow their casual and light hearted conversation as they are on their way to massacre a bunch of people for their boss. This segment gave us the greatest SLJ moment of all time. Jackson's performance is so captivating here as he plays the hardcore hitman. But when he looks into the camera reciting that bible verse, that was just magic.The next segment was all about Uma Thurman and her role as Mia. Her and Vincent had great chemistry on screen. There's a lot that can be broken down about their talk at the restaurant and the characters themselves, but I won't get into it. I really just want to talk about the performances because that's what stuck out to me the most in this part. Uma was really captivating as Mia and Travolta's performance when Mia overdosed really added to the intensity. Once again. There's a bit of irony for Vincent as he feared what Marcellus would do if he found out what happened. He thought once Mia was okay, it would all be fine and dandy, but he ends of dying literally the next day.Now Butch's big segment was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in a movie. I mean I get it, but what the heck, you know? My big take away here is the story of the Watch. We're given a traumatic story via a five minute close up of Christopher Walken, and then we see Butch's own journey as he retrieves the watch from his apartment. The tales of the watch surrounds the idea of two men going through a harrowing experience to get the Watch from point A to point B. So there was a great parallel between generations. Also love Bruce Willis here, always fun watching him in any movie.The final sequence is such a creative choice for so many reasons. First of all, after the rest of the film being very linear, for some reason we go back a couple days and return to Vincent & Jules. After my first watch, I spent days thinking of why they would do this, especially since we just saw Vincent get shot to death. Knowing Vincent is dead, you appreciate his comedic relationship with Jules a bit more, especially as they deal with the ""Bonnie incident."" I ultimately think the nonlinear order here has everything to do with Jules's verse, however. The segment kicks off with the same ""look into the camera"" moment from the beginning and goes from there.They also end up in the diner that the couple form the beginning are in and are present when the couple robs it. This is where Jules himself breaks down the verse he's recited, giving his own interpretation. After my 2nd watch, this was the moment I believed to be the whole point of Pulp Fiction. - Not just a reason for nonlinearity, but the whole purpose of the film. I won't articulate my analysis completely, but I basically think that all the characters we've seen are trying to be the shepherds in their own story, that they, in their own way, are on the ""path of the righteous man,"" trying to help those around them ""through the valley of darkness."" Your interpretation can be different than mine, but I do believe that this verse means everything to the story, which is why it was part of the last sequence, as well as a scene from the beginning.Overall thoughts? This is a great movie. It's enjoyable for a casual viewer and can totally be ripped a part for analysis. The filmography was every great. There a 3 big one shot steady cam scenes that I love to watch - in the apartment, at the restaurant, and following Butch. The music was so fun and energetic and helped bring life to the film. The way the entire film was written is so unique and after 30 years is unlike anything we've seen in film. I just want to get into Tarantino's head for the creative vision. Like what was the purpose of the close ups with the piercing girl? Why have that 10 minute close up with Butch when he's introduced? What's the purpose of not revealing what was in the case?So many little details, so much to enjoy. Pulp Fiction can viewed over and over again and a single person will notice something new every time. It's timeless, fun, well written, well acted, well filmed, and a true icon in film history."

                        ",My review,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations."

19 April 2006,matlefebvre20,0,1,10,The Tarantino Revolution,"Three stories into one. This is ""Pulp Fiction"", one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.Just after seeing the first story, which stars John Travolta and Uma Thurman, I was satisfied with the movie. The second (and the best) story, with Bruce Willis, made me understand that the movie deserved a 5/5. Add another story, with Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, and you know that ""Pulp Fiction"" is simply perfect and a revolution into the film industry.What impressed me the most is the structure of the movie. Even before the opening credits appear, you assist to a conversation between a young man and his girlfriend who decide to rob the restaurant in which they eat, because it would be an easy job. They both shout ""Hands up!"", just when director Quentin Tarantino cuts the scene starts the credits and then shifts elsewhere. Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) are about to meet their boss Marcellus (Ving Rhames), but they meet other guys and the scene (that I baptized scene A) ends tragically, but not for everybody.The first story begins. Vincent and Mia(Thurman), Marcellus' wife meet each other for a drug trade. They go to a 50's drive-in and they participate into a dance competition, which they win. It shouldn't be surprising, when the dance man is John Travolta. It's clearly visible that he hasn't buried the Grease and Saturday Night Fever days. But the story ends less happily as Mia overdoses herself and Vincent brings her to the dealer who sold him the drug. In order to re-animate Mia, Vincent has to perform into the most shocking scene I've ever seen.Cut to the second story. Young Butch is given his deceased father's gold watch by Capt. Koons(Christopher Walken). Actual Butch(Willis), a boxer, wakes up from this dream and goes to the ring. We never see a single scene from the combat, but the radio announcer tells that Butch fought his adversary so hard that he killed him. Unaware that he actually killed his opponent, Butch flees to the motel where his wife Fabienne waits for him. Fabienne forgot Butch's watch and the boxer goes back to his home to get it. But he discovers a gun on his oven and at the same moment, Vincent goes out from the bathroom. Instinctly, Butch takes the gun and shoots Vincent to death. Butch flees in his car and Marsellus appears in front of him. Butch runs over Marsellus, but the boss wants Butch's head and he pursuits him to an electronic store. Both men are taken hostages by the salesman and the sexual-obsessed policeman on the scene. They're able to free themselves. Butch kills the salesman with a Japanese sabre, while Marcellus shoots the policeman into the genitals.My God, this is something entirely new for the violence genre! This is some kind of depiction and exaggeration of today's everyday violence and it's absolutely awesome. The aggressiveness and the violent instinct, as well as the sexual needs make the characters intriguing and fascinating, if not frightening. In their minds, violence is neither funny, nor dramatic. Violence has just lost its signification and it becomes the only employable language into their world. This world has lost of its logic and moral working, turning itself into a savage jungle filled of barbaric people.The third story begins with the scene A and its followings. Vincent and Jules bring a friend into their car. During the ride, Vincent inadvertently shoots him and the vehicle is filled of blood and a corpse lays on the back seat. Vincent and Jules visit a friend, Jimmy(Tarantino), and try to find a solution. Soon, Winston Wolf(Harvey Keitel) arrives and tells them what to do. The following scenes are filled with drama, as well as extreme-black humor. Vincent and Jules decide to take breakfast in a restaurant, but the place they chose is about to be taken over by robbers. So, the first scene of all superimposes itself. What follows is images of drama, as well as this ultra-violence and that taste for anarchy and robbery.""Pulp Fiction"" is simply a classic. Its revolutionary structure and stories make it twisting and intriguing and the characters that we see here are only superficial, especially the main ones. Jules takes violence as a simple aspect of life and his religious chats are somehow special. Butch is a soul-tortured boxer who acts like violence was as normal as breathing. The drug use and the sexual situations into the movie may be controversial, but they're just other elements from a mad world, in which violence, absurdity and foolishness are the order of the day."
15 June 2018,oTHATchrissmith,1,1,10,Brilliant,"The characters are genuine, the intertwining plot is entertaining and fantastically put together, but the back-story we pull from each character through their naturally cool, everyday dialogue and the stylish and scene-fitting soundtrack is what truly sets Tarantino's films apart from any other. For instance, I will forever think of Butch Coolidge taking out Maynard and Zed (only after having knocked out the Gimp) with a sword every time I hear ""Comanche"" by The Revels. Same goes for Mrs. Mia Wallace overdosing to Urge Overkill's ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon."" And as far as the dialogue goes, there are too many solid lines to even try to pull out a favourite exchange. This film is incredible from beginning to end, and leaves you wanting more of the same."
9 January 2014,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,0,1,10,You don't know the facts; just the fiction,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a movie about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect.It is one of the most influential film of the decade; its circular timeline can be sensed in films as different as ""The Usual Suspects,'' ""Zero Effect'' and ""Memento,'' not that they copied it, but that they were aware of the pleasures of toying with chronology.But it isn't the structure that makes ""Pulp Fiction'' a great film. Its greatness comes from its marriage of vividly original characters with a series of vivid and half-fanciful events and from the dialogue. The dialogue is the foundation of everything else.If the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. The people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. It also means that the characters don't all sound the same: Travolta is laconic, Jackson is exact, Plummer and Roth are dopey lovey-doveys, Keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, Thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas.While watching this movie, I realize that all of the dialogue is entirely devoted to explaining or furthering the plot, and no joy is taken in the style of language and idiom for its own sake. The characters in ""Pulp Fiction'' are always talking, and always interesting, funny, scary or audacious. This movie would work as an audio book."
5 April 2011,Jetset971,0,2,10,"This IS the best film of 1994, no of the 90s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I am not ashamed to say it. This may very well be Quentin Tarentino's very own Citizen Kane. This is LEGENDARY film making of the highest caliber. I have sat through this movie countless times and never have gotten board by it. In fact, I always seem to find and appreciate a new aspect when i watch it. I don't even know where to begin when it comes to praising this film. Directing, writing, acting, cinematography, are all flawless and beyond reproach. I really dig the style and mood this film generates and absolutely love the dialog. Tarentino and Roger Avery wrote a script so insightful and intriguing that even mundane topics like ""Fast food in Europe"" or ""The merits of bacon"" are impossible to ignore. These guys could make reading a tax audit engrossing! Along with the script, i have to re-credit Tarentino's direction. I am convinced that in anybody Else's hand this would not have been nearly as great a film. They camera angles the scene shots and oh yes, the editing, are so innovative that they are beyond words. The cast. John Travolta gave, i think, his best performance ever as the drug addict hit-man Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson, who is brilliant in any performance, brings out new dimensions in acting excellence here as Jules Winfield. Uma Thurman is breathtaking as Mia Wallace, the coke head who does drugs because her life is so superficial she thinks she cant feel anything without them. Bruce Willis, as boxer Butch Coolage, commands the screen with a reserved but seething intensity. Havey Keitel has a great scene stealing moment as the problem solving expert Mr. Wolf. I could go on and on but you will not find one week performance from anyone in this movie.How this movie did not win best picture in 1994, instead losing to ""Forrest Gump"" is way beyond me. Don't get me wrong, Gump was a good movie but to me, it couldn't hold a candle to Fiction."
13 December 2006,marctol,4,7,10,QT at his very best,"QT has the ability to shock his audience with every movie he has made so far. Also this QT blockbuster contains colourful characters, brilliant dialogues and a dynamic, original storyline. I understand that not everyone will enjoy the movie because of its excessive violence and hard-to-believe scenes added to the plot. However, Pulp Fiction is one of the most original movies ever. Not a scene goes by without superb acting, un4seen twists, and some of the darkest humor you'll ever see. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are unbelievably cool as the evil duo, and Bruce Willis ""brings out the best out of"" Ving Rhames.. Besides this star ensemble, the most equally enjoyable as horrific role is probably for QT's muse Uma Thurman. Even when you don't like QT, Pulp Fiction is a MUST-SEE for everyone who is looking for a sensational, dynamic and most of all original peace of film."
10 November 2002,Runinrider,2,5,9,A strange twist of tales.,"~ SpoilersPulp Fiction is an anomaly; it's a story of different things, different characters, et cetera. It's a movie based on the life of various people -- whether criminals, boxers, or male-rapists -- who meet their change of life, their fates, within the course of two days. The movie in itself is hard to describe, and I'm sure director/screenplay writer Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) simply wanted it that way.The movie begins in a small cafe, which gets customers high in numbers and whose wallets contain big bucks. Then it shows you two robbers, thieves, who go over why they shouldn't rob a place like this as simply no one believes that coffee shops do get hold up -- and if they do no one will really give too much of a ****. Then they take out their guns and open their mouths where finally the theme of ""Miserlou"" plays and Pulp Fiction begins.
You then are introduced to two hitmen, Vincent Vega (John Travolta--Broken Arrow, Grease) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson--Shaft, XXX). They go over their plans, visit a commoner and then question him, he apparently got into something with a crimeboss's wife. They ask for the ""666"" coded briefase and then kill him after a faithful reading of the bible by none other then Jules himself. After this you'll then see the movie enter a section, which simply brings up a new part to the ongoing story of this movie. And aside from the hitmen you would also get in touch with boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), Crimeboss Marsellus (Ving Rhames), and the crimeboss's wife Mia (Uma Thurman).The performances are simply top-notch in here. John Travolta gives a powerful interpretation of a hitman who really doesn't care much and doesn't show as much respect for anybody, whether it be his friends or enemies. Samuel L. Jackson also fits his role as Jules by being as badass as possible, though never trying to harm anybody as he is getting tired of this ""killing"" business. Bruce Willis' performance is also astounding, as he goes into brawls with Rhames, kills a hillbilly rapist, and shows his schlong on screen alongside his heartwarming girlfriend. Uma Thurman's role is also great and Harvey Keitel (the Wolf) and Ving Rhames bring power and ""bang"" to their performances which make them an even bigger asset to the movie. Hell, Tarantino himself co-stars.Finally, Pulp Fiction is a must-see. It's not a classic, no Godfather or Scarface, but it was never intended to be that in the first place. It is simply an innovative piece of action that almost no one should miss out (I still think this movie was robbed of an Oscar back in 95 -- Tom Hanks and his portrayal of Forrest Gump won the award).*** 1/2"
26 August 2012,filmfan1991,0,1,10,Tarantino's best film,"Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. The plot is aired out of sequence and chronicles the lives of criminals over a period of a few days. The humor is dark but incredibly funny especially Samuel Jackon's infamous ""what"" scene or ""I Just Shot Marvin In the Face"". A star studded ensemble cast with great performances all around. This is definitely an art house film which means that this film wont be for the casual viewer like his previous film. Like ""Resevior Dogs"" this film has strong graphic violence and constant strong language enough to make this an NC-17 instead of an R but still one of my favorites. Little trivia: This movie got John Travolta's movie career back on track after its popularity. 10 out of 10 stars"
18 February 2007,dj_xand325,0,2,10,A Paragon Picture...,"Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' continues to inspire, shock and intrigue an entire audience of film watchers since its release in 1994. The story consists of three sagas of drugs, deceit and sleaze inter-linking in a vastly unconventional and unchronological style leading to a simply astonishing end sequence. Tarantino builds a strong plethora of almost archetypal characters that resembles pulp material. The scenarios are almost generic situations that we always see, yet Tarantino and Avary add another zest to these stories that lead on a tangent resulting in a complex inter-mingling of transition and unbelievable acts of fate.Interpreting this movie is almost impossible; it's become the subject of many film studies courses. Responses to the mysterious contents of the briefcase is a hotly fought debate. Some say it's the soul of Marsellus, others the jewels from Reservoir Dogs or others simply say it's a golden light bulb! Tarantino has made the film stick with you, caused debate amongst its fan and accomplished a medium of mysteriousness towards the film that somewhat mirrors the incomprehensible nature of 2001: A Space Odyssey.An overall interpretation of this film is equally impossible. It is often called a 'masterpiece with no message', this is true but a fan can at least delve deeper into the subject matter of this film, what's happening? and what really binds this set of sleazy characters. Tarantino's script tends to look at the importance of transition and the repercussions of not acknowledging this transition. Butch and Marsellus' experience with Zed leads to an immense change in their relationship, their blind hate leads to a mutual sense of acceptance that Butch takes into account and leaves town as soon as he can. Then you have Jules' 'moment of clarity'. His divine experience makes him change his ways and acknowledge a sign of transition away from gangster activities. Interestingly, Vincent's disregardance of this 'divine intervention' leads to a cruel fate of death. Then finally, you have Yolandi and Ringo's frightening thought that they would lose each other therefore seem as if to alter their villainous ways. Their transition is captured by Jules' final speech speaking of his desire to be the shepard and guide them through a tyranny of evil (which he ultimately does!). In a way, 'Pulp Fiction' tracks a range of characters going through a huge change governed by the perplexing actions of fate or even of a form of divinity.One thing that is extraordinary about Tarantino's script is its flawless ability to enthral and entertain. The speech is memorable and expertly crafted, the banter is thought-provoking and lifts these characters from their almost archetypal interpretations.Jules: Let's get into character The script is almost a critical expose of what goes on behind the scenes of these typical gangster situations that we've seen so many times. That is why the script is so dynamic. Never have I comprehended a screenplay where almost every scene has quotable lines and I probably never will again! The film was garnished with 7 Oscar nominations and 1 win (for the screenplay). Perhaps Pulp Fiction should have snatched best picture and some acting Oscars yet the important thing is, the film didn't need the awards and Tarantino didn't want it! He just made a movie he wanted to make and like so many other films shunned by the Academy, it has become as memorable if not more memorable as the film that won best picture (Forrest Gump) PulpFiction is a cinematic marvel, a tour-de-force of magnificent proportions. Beautifully directed by Tarantino and the awesome performances of Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta elevate the film to a cult pedestal that is almost unrivalled. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece may be one of the greatest films of all time.10/10"
16 May 2021,ashwinkulkarni-92227,1,2,10,Best movie ever made. A true masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is hands down, the best movie ever made. I'm still surprised how Quentin Tarantino could connect 5 different scenes which seem to be so independent of each other. Pulp Fiction dives into the lives of 2 hitmen, a boxer, a gangster and 2 robbers. All of these lives have been depicted just like any normal person, but who know what they are doing.I love the vagueness of the movie. As these 5 different stories have not been shown in the correct sequence, the director has left us to think about how the events took place chronologically. The vagueness of the movie has resulted in countless different theories like what was in the briefcase, why did Marcellus throw Antwan down 4 stories, and many more. Just by watching this film once, you may or may not capture its true essence but believe me, watch it at least twice and after doing some thinking about the events, you would realize how amazing the movie is. Out of all the scenes, my favorite one is ""The Bonnie Situation"" where ""Winston Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) appears in the movie. This scene just shows how would you solve a tough situation under tremendous pressure and time constraints. The coolness of Winston Wolf in spite of the pressure has made this scene shine out.So overall, according to me, Pulp Fiction is the best Hollywood movie ever made. You have to watch this classic and I'm 100% sure, you won't regret it."
28 March 2006,gino-d,7,18,6,overrated but nice,"Ther are three story's involved that come together in some sort of way, there is Vincent Vega the man who has to look out for his boss girlfriend, 2 people robbing a dinner place and the boxer butch.In my eyes pulp fiction is a nice movie nothing more and nothing less. It starts out very slow and the first hour is a bit boring the conversations are just too long and not even that good. Luckily it gets better half way through. Thr characters are all nice, no one is boring or annoying and the actors play them very well, but the biggest pro is how the story's come together, this is done very well in my opinion. watch this movie if you are a Tarantino fan else you might be disappointed because it's not as good as everyone claims."
11 October 2005,bulleetz37235,0,3,10,Excellent,"Has there ever been a more stylish film? Pulp Fiction, from the mighty intellect of Quentin Tarantino. A feast for the delights of a young man like myself. Constructed with prowess and supremacy.It tells a weaving tale in 3 main parts, with a little cunning introduction to boot. **First, it's a couple aptly named Pumpkin and Honeybun robbing a diner. (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) **Then it's two hit men (one being Samuel L Jackson stealing the show)on a job to retrieve some merchandise for their gang boss. **Then it's the other hit-man, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) being assigned to take the gang boss' wife out for a good time. Yet she ODs and it's up to him to get her to his drug dealers house for quick adrenaline. **Then it's Butch Coolidge's turn (played by Bruce Willis) as a boxer who betrays his boss (the gang boss) and does a runner, only to leave his gold watch which he must get back, exposing himself to the gang after him. **Then we revert back to the hit men after they have retrieved the boss' stuff, and who accidentally happen to shoot their passenger on the way home. And in comes the lovely stash him in the garage routine. Clean up and go, with the help of The Wolf (Harvey Kietel) and disgruntled Jimmy (Tarantino himself) who is the owner of said garage, in which he needs to clear before his wife gets home. **Finally the hit men go to breakfast after the clean up, and get caught up in the diner robbery, only to confront them in a dramatic climax of cool talk and muffins...That's a hell of a lot of film packed into 2hrs 20mins, and it is apt to assume that this is quite amazing. It sounds confusing and imaginative, and it sort of is. But Tarantino seems to add enough realism to the picture so you can watch it comfortably never once getting ahead of yourself, or lost in the plot. It's a cool look at gang life, with fun stories and a great soundtrack to back up that this film is not only hip to the beat, but a genuine cinematic triumph... Enjoy!"

                        ",Brilliant & one-of-a-kind,"Come on, how often do the critics & public agree?  This film knocks your socks off.  Just when you think it's heading for the fast lane, it slows down.  When you think it's going to drag, it speeds up.  Dread Travolta about to whiz around on the dance floor, relax.(SPOILER:  Assuming Bonnie's going to be white?  Nope you'd be wrong.)  Full of action, irony, intrigue, twists, turns, humor, cynicism, raunchiness, tenderness, lightness, darkness, heaviness, this film has it all.  I have watched this movie no less than 20 times and never fail to see something new or ""get"" another aspect of it (except the friggin time sequence & whatever the hell is in that briefcase!).  And look closely, all its ""extremely graphic"" physical violence is ALL IN YOUR OWN HEAD!!!  One of the all-time Best."
2 October 2017,andrewnmiller,0,0,10,A solid accomplishment of filmmaking.,"For a long time, Pulp Fiction was always a movie that never appealed to me as given it's gore and blatant language, I stayed away from it but after a friend had recommend it to me, I decided to finally watch it and let me tell you, it certainly deserves all the praise it's gotten. From it's graphic violence and slick directing to it's talented cast and kick-ass soundtrack, Pulp Fiction is one of the crown jewels of cinema history.As the movie's story isn't told in chronological order, the three main stories continually interconnect with each other starting with two hit-men named Vincent and Julies appearing at an apartment complex to commandeer a briefcase for their boss Marcellus Wallace and murder a man named Brett and one of his assistants. They then deliver the case to Marcellus only to be kept waiting while Wallace brides a boxer named Butch to be intentionally knocked out during his upcoming match. What follows is a series of events from Vincent taking Marcellus's wife on a date to Marcellus and Butch being held hostage by a pawnshop owner.One of the first scenes of the movie are Vincent and Julies taking about what a Big Mac in France is called, the scene is humorous and has a certain charm to it but it also makes these two hit-men look a bit too ordinary. If the viewer didn't realize, they would think that these two are just talking on their way to work, but what's interesting is that their discussion has no importance to the outcome of the movie and yet without scenes like this, Pulp Fiction would never have been the movie that it is today. One gets the sense that Tarantino threw whatever he wanted into the film and yet in some way, the finished movie isn't just consistent but amazingly rough around the edges.As the movie doesn't follow a single narrative, some people will have problems keeping up with the story and who's backstabbing who, but the movie works a lot better if you pay close attention to what is happening and see it as a dark comedy disguised as a crime drama. Each of the stories in the movie start with a circumstance that could have been developed for any run-of the-mill crime movie, but something always manages to go awry, some tiny sudden calamity which effects the entire case and causes it to crumble, driving the frenzied characters to bizarre methods. Tarantino's creativeness comes from a capability to focus on insignificant details and accompany them wherever they might go, even if they divert the story away from predictable story changes.It's no surprise that fans of the movie have spent arguing about what's in the suitcase, which leads to them delving deeper into the film more than Tarantino anticipated. The movie is so wonderfully arranged with a lot of amazing details, many of them you won't even see on your first viewing so the film seems to be bawling for deep analysis, but there isn't anything to really analyze, as the name of the film implies, it's an accomplishment in craft and method and a distinguished and arranged one at that. Perhaps no other movie script will ever find a superior role for detours as the entire movie seems to involve them at every turn. No character speaks a line of dialog in a sincere way as Julies does in one of the final scenes of the movie where he could just tell the couple robbing a restaurant that they should just stay clam and no one will be injured which would be a typical line of dialog from your standard action or crime movie, but rather than do that, Jules goes out on a limb about what Fonzie is then asks the robber to get his wallet. Tarantino relishes every phrase uttered by his characters, discovering a promising joke in every conversation and fortifying it with crafty mainstream culture mentions, but the dialog isn't just funny; it's packed with insightful reflections on human conduct or people's religious views. Mia Wallace's comment to Vincent about reveling in the silence or Julies reciting Ezekiel 25.17 are the best examples of this and out of all the scripts to come out of Hollywood, Pulp Fiction is truly one of the best.The film is also shot wonderfully with no shortage of bright colors, amazing camcorder shots and fantastic camera angles, the soundtrack is also amazing with a great mix of classic songs ranging from Dusty Springfield's ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" to Neil Diamond's ""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon"" which help to make it a truly unique movie but also makes it more fun to watch.for a film of this magnitude to work, the cast had to be perfect for the roles and they certainly deliver on that. Uma Thurman is wonderful as Mia Wallace nailing the sharp dialog with ease, Bruce Willis provides a dynamic performance as the boxer Butch as does Maria De Mederios as Butch's girlfriend. Ving Rhams plays mob boss Marcellus Wallace in true style. Eric Scholtz is great as the drug dealer Lance, Christopher Waken pops up in a flash from the past scene and gives a fine performance even if his time on screen isn't very much and even director Quentin Tarantino shows up in a short cameo. John Travolta's performance as Vincent Vega is truly a sight to see as he puts a new coat of paint on the role of the hit-man and makes it his own with just the right amount of elegance and charm, while Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Jules with his undercurrent of evilness, showing an attitude of vicious anger and is still to maintain his cool even when facing death.There isn't much else I can say about Pulp Faction except to go watch it if you haven't already."
14 February 2007,Roger_Sterling,0,1,10,Friggin blew me away,"I saw Pulp Fiction one week ago today, and I should have written this review earlier. I heard this movie was good, but damn! I had no idea what I was in for. Quentin Tarantino does one hell of a job directing this movie (and his cameo was decent too), and practically everyone in the movie gives a good performance.My favorite character is easily Jules Winnfield, played by the one and only Samuel L. Jackson. He is indeed one BMF in this movie, and absolutely OWNED the final scene in the diner.Another thing I noticed is how many things I have seen on TV and in other movies that payed homage to this movie. Not that I'm surprised, this is probably Tarantino's best (I haven't seen all his movies), and is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen."

                        ",Pulp,"An intertwined set of stories.The acting was great in this movie and the scenes and situations unique and exciting. While there was no main driving plot, I felt that the dialogue was very well written and performed great. I don't know why I feel like some of the lines are so memorable, but they just are.In addition, I thought some parts were very funny, helped add to how memorable the movie was.The scenes also not being in complete chronological order helped shape how well the movie turned out. Lastly, I felt the movie maintained the right amount of tension throughout."

I love it. Each person (actor/actress) played their part perfectly.If you love great acting, great scenes then i would recommend this film. Such a great film for adults. Well worth a 9 / 10."

                        ","Disjointed, still made sense though!","Never had the chance to watch this movie the first time around, the movie that catapulted John Travolta's acting career back into orbit after many repeated failures since Saturday Night Fever. As in other Quentin Tarantino's films, the layout of the movie is different and is full of gore, violence and flowery explicit language. Bruce Willis career too had a kick-start here. I kind of liked it with its unique brand of humour, the right chemistry between the main hitmen, Samuel L Jackson and Travolta and the witty dialogue.
The story is basically disjointed and is told in non-linear fashion but they all make sense in the end. You would be wondering why Travolta gets shot death in the middle of the show but reappears later.
It starts with two novice robbers chitchatting and decide to rob a diner. When they (one of them is Tim Roth of 'Lie to me') hold a gun to hold up, the credits roll in. The story stops there and continues at the tail end of the movie. But then the tail end is not sequentially the end of the story as the end is told in the middle! New concept, a breakthrough that was earth shattering and earned many accolades.
Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) are hitmen for Wallace. They are mean killers who collect some merchandise from double crossers. Then there is a scene where Vincent has to baby-sit Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman). She overdoses herself with heroin and creates a heart stopping scene for Vincent.
Another plot is the story of Butch, a boxer, who is suppose to lose a fight on Wallace's orders but defeats his opponent instead! The mob is hot on his heels while he makes a dash. He has, however, to return to his apartment to retrieve an old wrist which he inherited from his great grandfather! Vincent is waiting for him there but is shot by Butch instead.
In a twist, Wallace and Butch get entangled with a shop owner who apprehend them.
In another scene, Wallace accidentally shoots a victim and calls upon Jimmie (Tarantino) to clear up his mess.
The scene finally returns to the diner where the two robbers are. Coincidentally, Vincent and Jules are there. Because of what Jules perceived as a miracle and a message from God, he gives his money to the robber and leaves his profession.
An entertaining flick..."
6 April 2020,Emre-kyncu68,1,2,8,A Cult Movie,"One of the masterpieces made by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction is a movie that makes a difference with its style. First of all, the movie has a mixed chronological order and I have never complained about it while watching the movie. Tarantino's character choices are very successful. Vincent and Jules character is very harmonious. Slang is used a lot in the movie, but it does not bother at all. On the contrary it makes you laugh. If the movie has a good end or a bad end, you can't understand at first. In fact, the movie ends in a place called ""The movie is excited."" And at first I thought that the movie had no end, but the script of the movie gets better when you think about it in chronological order. Tarantino tried to confuse a simple scenario in Pulp Fiction and was successful. There are many theories about the movie, and they all come to beautiful conclusions. Music is almost as great as the movie.Coming to the minuses of the movie, it doesn't have a big mistake, but it's not in a movie that everyone will love. You just need to think about the movie a bit. The script is beautiful to implement but simple. I think something more impressive could be added to the script. In addition, the character Pumpkin is somewhat calmer than his wife (Actually, we only see about 15 minutes in the movie.). He would have been better if he was a bit freak-like too.The movie is already rated, if you haven't watched it definitely watch.And my score is 85/100."
6 March 2016,joeravioli,0,1,8,Pulp Fiction is pulp. Who knew?,"Pulp Fiction is just the sort of film that will change the way that you think, although that remains to be seen whether or not that's a good thing. Ask yourself: would you rather live out your life thinking eloquent, civil thoughts or gleefully profane, borderline blasphemous mental rants (most of which having to do with fast food) that would send Mike Tyson running into a corner with both hands over his ears, screaming ""I can't hear yooooou!!"".Okay, it's not that bad. The f-bomb count, according to the IMDb parents guide, is 272 (with 40 in the maternal form), but unless you're a fat, doe-eyed little boy with one hand on the TV remote and the other on the Bible, you won't be offended.Anyway, I'll stop before this turns into a full blown parent's guide. I mean, if you want a parent's guide, go to the parent's guide.Pulp Fiction reminded me of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (or any of her works, for that matter) in that it prioritizes character exposition rather than narrative. In truth, the narrative -- much like an Austen novel -- is there, yes, but it's not really what we're in for. Rather, we dip into Tarantino's perverted thoughts to see his characters unfold, live, breathe, and die in front of us as they float through a world subject to Tarantino's gleeful aggressions. Tarantino, a master of dialogue (although I'm sure Austen would object), creates and develops such beautifully rich psychological profiles that he allows you to sympathize with even the most depraved of human beings. For me, being highly concerned with values and morals and all other sentimental detritus that modern society condemns, this proved slightly difficult to stomach. For example, in the first scene, we witness two murders. There's a bit of buildup, sure, but you're never quite given the reason why you have to sit through an execution.To his credit, Tarantino makes his depravity an afterthought. The film pulsates with a beautiful energy absent from modern screen writing. And the acting is sublime. Never will I forget Hoffman's slick, cool, and hilariously restrained twist with Uma Thurman, or even good ol' Sam Jackson's ""English motherf- (and you know the rest)"", or EVEN Ving Rhames' wise comments on pride. The character's passionately delivered lines brim with quotable dialogue, the real, crazy stuff that sends delightful shivers down your spine.As I previously mentioned, the plot really doesn't matter in this film. Tarantino's use of the nonlinear narrative (which has since become famous) ends up making the order of the story very difficult to follow. In fact, after finishing it, I couldn't for the life of me remember the order of what happened. I knew that some things happened: people talked, did drugs, killed people, got raped, etc, but the order in which all these things happened escaped me. But once you realize who died, who got raped, who talked, and who did drugs, you'll realize that the story is a great deal more complicated than you give it credit for being. Not only did the characters interact, they grew, progressed, and even died. This I loved. It's Pulp Fiction in its purest form, a mess of bullets, blood, and dialogue that is at once unexceptional and utterly unforgettable."
19 March 2020,t-81966-84968,0,0,8,a brief evaluation,"The director put the end of this incident, the death of Vincent, in the penultimate part. What is more, Jules's change becomes the last part of this film, although it happens before Vincent died. In my view, it helps to connect the end with the beginning of the film, which means crimes circulate unceasingly. Except that, I suppose this detail is designed to show that criminals should be redeemed from evil, no matter by Christ or themselves."

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"...Wow...what is there to say? No, I'm being serious; what is there to say which hasn't by now? 'Pulp Fiction''; there is nothing that has not been said about it. The film was released during the same year and lost the academy award for best picture to 'Forest Gump'.'Pulp Fiction' is a black comedy which focuses on several people who have a sort of affiliation with the man Marsellus Wallace (a mob boss of sorts). The two central characters of Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are hit-men who work for Wallace (though I would say that they're actually paid to do whatever random chore is asked of them). The film is divided into several chapters (none of which are shown chronologically) and these chapters all depict a period of three or so days. The prologue is of the first day, and the first chapter is of the first day also (some time earlier); the second chapter is of after the prologue, and the third chapter is of the second two days; the fourth chapter is of the time between the prologue and the first chapter. Most every bit of these chapters are full with black comedy; I did not know this all when I first watched the movie, and so I was pleasantly shocked to find that the (very un-over-the-top) deaths and detailed speeches caused for me to laugh some.I'm not going to say much because whoever is reading this and has never seen the full movie should; I won't spoil anything for you. 10/10"
27 November 2019,Naushad07,0,0,10,Great film with hidden message.,"There are many characters in the movie with their own arcs and the movie is about how they affect each other.
Everyone is good but it is Samuel L Jackson who steals the show with his performance in the last scene.
If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading now because I am talking about the hidden messages in the movie.
Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta are two hitmen who work for a big gangster. Both of them are doing their routine job one day and have a near death experience.
Samuel thinks it's divine intervention and God wants him to leave this job.
He leaves the job and is saved but John doesn't.
John accidentally kills a boy after this because of his carelessness. His boss's wife ends up in a near death situation because of his mistake. He saves her but still doesn't leave the job and is killed.
Bruce Willis is a boxer who cheats the boss of Samuel and John by promising to lose a fight and winning it instead. He kills his opponent and has no regret. He kills John also because John was hired to kill him. He finally has a change of heart and saves that gangster from two people. The gangster forgives him and asks him to leave the town. This is how he is saved.
John (before getting killed) and Samuel go to a restaurant where a couple tries to rob everyone but Samuel takes his gun out and gives them all the money. He asks them to leave without fighting and they do. They are saved.
Quentin Tarantino wanted to show us that God gives us second chance and we shouldn't waste it. Otherwise we should be ready for punishment."
9 December 2018,agostino-dallas,0,1,8,"Original, shocking good!!","You read the title of my review, you saw this movie, no need to write all the stuff critics and amateur reviewers like me have already wrote. OK, having said that, what is left to write? I will give it a try. I watched this movie in 1995, in Brazil movies used to get a little later. Some movies still come here 6 or 9 months after released in the US. And this movie was a total cult-to-be right away. The thing people talked over and over was how Tarantino was able to make the actors -- Travolta and Jackson -- really sound like two ordinary bad guys having a true bad guy conversation. A crude, hardcore type of conversation. It was like he had the power to put us there. No regular artificial type of dialogue. On top of it, the fact that the movie was not made to run a typical chronological order of facts. I think it is still good day but of course it would not make the same impact it did back in 1994."
27 June 2017,adam111111,0,0,9,Intense iconic fun.,"There have been few movies that I have enjoyed more than Pulp Fiction. It combines intense action, dark comedy, brooding humanity, and for lack of a better word, some really, really fun scenes. It is graphic, but it is done well. For one small example, I know no other movie that combines tender family connections in the face of war and the fact that people hide stuff where the sun don't shine as flatly or as well as Pulp Fiction.Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and John Travolta all do a tremendous job, as one would expect. The different story-lines are executed well both individually and as a single story. I'm searching my mind to find any faults, but I can't think of any. It's a great movie. Enough said.(I saw this on June 27, 2017.)"
16 August 2006,PorridgeBird,1,3,7,"I don't know why, but I liked it.","I'll say this straight off: Pulp Fiction, unlike Tarantino's previous film Reservoir Dogs, is appropriately titled. Pulp is a publication which, according to dictionary.com, contains ""lurid subject matter."" This film is, put simply, trash.And I can easily see why this film may be a low point in American cinema. I can see how there can be a large amount of people who see the horrendous things this movie may or may not promote and call it the end of civilization. And I can easily see myself fitting into that crowd very well.So why do I like PULP FICTION? I keep looking for reasons to hate it, but I can't find them.Gratuitous violence? Can't people see that this sort of pointless bloodshed isn't entertaining? And yet I've seen worse: KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS (1949) is about a man who is able to kill seven men and one woman (all played by Alec Guinness) to become the Duke of Chalfont. And how about Titus Andronicus? That Shakespeare was one sick mother-- Profanity? Isn't this level of f-word usage unreasonable? And yet only yesterday I encountered two men who had never seen the movie before and were dropping f-bombs like a WWII blitzkrieg. It's not unreasonable; it's a reflection of society. It's not pretty, but then I didn't expect the Muppet Movie on this one. The other forms of deviance in this film? One word: DELIVERANCE. Aesthetic self-indulgence? Hey, I sort of liked CITIZEN KANE as well. It uses a camera trick every second, and not one of them helps the plot itself. But I felt it worked. Some films are good because they have a great story. Some films are good because they look nice on the mantelpiece. (The best films, of course, are both.)I don't know why I should hate PULP FICTION.But if that's the case, then why should I like it?Good acting? I've seen less wooden characterizations in children's nativity plays. Samuel L. Jackson does a good job, and Bruce Willis has my favorite performance, but everyone else seems a bit held back by their foppery. Stylish camera-work? Some angles were nice, creating some good opportunities for my laptop wallpaper, but nothing spectacular. Dancing? You call that dancing? Music? Well, yes, I suppose I do like it. But at two hours and more, the soundtrack isn't enough to like a film. Well, here goes everything:Maybe I enjoy this film because it can show that, beneath the violence and the cocaine snorting, there truly is a humanity of some sort. That's why the film opens with such a loving couple robbing a restaurant. That's why two killers can talk so much about foreign fast food. That's why Bruce Willis can go back to save the man who previously was trying to kill him. That's why the film ends with the return to the restaurant scene, with one final act of redemption. That's why the good people get off the hook and the bad ones are killed by toasters.Maybe I like this film because it shows that even the lowest scum has a sense of humanity.Maybe I like it because it proves that it's never too late to do right.Maybe I like it because it has a (BLEEP)in' adrenaline-injected heart.Maybe.While I can't give it the full marks some believe it deserves (in my mind, Tarantino's other masterwork RESERVOIR DOGS was better), I do think this is something worth watching. Just remember, as mentioned before, that this truly is Pulp Fiction. But it's Pulp like you've never seen before."
14 May 2006,ctrout,0,1,10,"""This IS A Tasty Burger!""","Pulp Fiction is a movie with many interweaving stories about corruption, redemption, and honor. It is set in Los Angeles and gives us a different look at the world of crime. In Quentin Tarantino's world, the bad guys are fast talkers with a stylized vocabulary. There's really only one hero in the film, but that doesn't stop you from liking most of the characters, especially the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson. There's nothing this guy can act poorly in. He's great in everything.As for everyone else, well John Travolta sky rocketed back into the public eye thanks to Tarantino. He was never better as the devoted hit-man to Jackson's one who has second thoughts about the profession. Uma Thurman can also thank Quentin for making her a household name, twice. She plays Mia Wallace, a very intriguing and different character that we don't get to see in many movies. Bruce Willis is the tough guy who's on the run from Mr. Wallace (Ving Rhames) after he doesn't do what he's told. As I said before, there's really only one hero in the picture and Willis pretty much fits that bill.All of the other members of the supporting cast do very well with the few scenes they have. Each one is equally memorable and even our director, Quentin Tarantino, gets bitten by the acting bug. It's Samuel L. Jackson who steals the show and that's what I remember most about this excellent movie. Of course, there is gratuitous violence and graphic language, but nothing that we don't say in everyday life. As long as you have a pleasure for dark humor, you'll enjoy this movie. It really is more of a comedy than any other genre.All in all Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of originality. Some say Tarantino rips off from those low budget movies of the '70s, but he's really just putting all of what he learned from his childhood and creating something that comes off as nothing we've seen before. And that's all I need to enjoy a movie: something that I haven't seen before and that comes off as entirely original and creative. It's one of the best movies of the '90s."
3 November 2019,ShitizSays,0,0,10,There is only one word that can describe this film - BRILLIANT,"Once in a while comes a film that changes the rules of film making and coincidentally Tarantino has been doing that for quite some time.
The First best part of the film is its non linear structure which is highly incoherent and yet makes sense.
The second best part of the film is the dialogues which are so unique and so out of the way of that is happening on screen that is amuses you. Sometimes you just want that dialogue ranting to run for few more minutes.
The third best thing is that characters come and go as they please and sometimes even die and then reappear and you won't mind it because that is all part of the film structure.
There is an urban legend that Tarantino wrote the entire screenplay on cards and then reshuffled them and whichever order the card stabilized became the sequence of scenes in the film.
You can measure the greatness of the film from the fact that the film written from a hotel room in hastiness later won the biggest prize that a film can get at Cannes Film Festival called ""Palm D'Or"".
It is not just a must watch film, this film is a case study on films and is taught in schools and will be done so because ""Pulp Fiction"" cannot be characterized in one genre. It has its own genre and it is the only member there.
Kudos to Great cinema."

Or is it the characters??? Tough to say which one, but Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough film is one hell of a ride. It is bold, unique, and at the same time interesting. Tarantino's script, the dialouges are ICONIC!!!!.period.And then there are those memorable characters, those scenes, which you keep going back to. Travolta, Willis are a revelation in their performances. Uma Thurman is outstanding as Mia Wallace. But I don't know why whenever I remember pulp fiction, Samuel Jackson's face comes to my mind. His bible reading hit-man was one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema.....Pulp fiction also has this innumerable pop culture references almost there throughout the movie, it is irreverence at it's best....its unique storytelling technique ( Tarantino uses chapters to divide tracks) was so praised that he used it for his future films too.Pulp fiction did a lot of good things...it gave us a new exciting filmmaker Qt, it revived travolta and Willis' s careers. It kick started Jackson's career. There were a lot of films like this after it's success but none matched up to this madcap, quirky classic."
17 January 2019,trminator-35198,0,1,8,Confusing,"This film, although really enjoyable, is confusing for two primary reasons. The first, the genre of the film seems to be an action film that would much rather be a comedy. Second, the story continuity makes little to no sense randomly throwing the viewer into different character perspectives with overlapping scenes and at one point what seems like an unexplained revival. The story would have to be spliced and refitted to make a consistant flow but was still a highly entertaining movie."
29 July 2007,jb-448,0,2,10,best movie ever,"Quentin Tarantino made his best film in 1994 with pulp fiction. The best cast in a movie i have ever seen. Sammy l Jackson, john travolta, Bruce Willis, uma Thurman Eric stoltz i mean come on. The plot absolutely rocks. Some people said that the sequence is a bit confusing but i kept up with it. But (spolier space ahead) Travolta dieing is a shame because he rocks. Sam rules as Jules. He's funny as hell but can scare the heck out of you when the bible scene comes on. That's the only reason i've ever picked up a bible to find that passage. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are sweet as well. Tim Roth was funny as hell at the start. Bruce was also good too. Too bad we didn't see the boxing match. Ving and Bruce in the basement scene though. Creepy as. Anyway great movie must see for everybody 10 out of 10"

16 September 2015,goreilly40,0,0,10,A cinematic masterpiece,"When you think of crime classics my generation would think of this movie, and its easy to see why. The three stories which make up the movie's composition although different are all very compelling and keep the viewer gripped to the very end. Tarantino discovered an acting gem in John Travolta whose acting career at that point was in limbo and thanks to his brilliant performance in the role of Vincent Vega has enjoyed a resurgence, in fact this movie has the rarity of having all the cast turning in memorable performances, particularly Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson were all unforgettable and some of the most memorable dialogue of the decade, especially the bible quotation from Jules. This movie has been described as graphically violent and while violence is present, most of the violence actually occurs off-screen and its not as graphic as other movies of a similar genre, but what is depicted in the movie is the consequences of living the kind of lifestyle that the main characters choose to live, which in some cases prove to be dire, so I don't think the movie in any way glamorizes the criminal lifestyle. What do I think is in the brief case well that debate will rage on and on so I'm not going to say. To summarize, the acting is great, the dialogue is some of the most memorable in recent history, the pacing is spot on, the action and violence is not as graphic or as over the top as some would think. All in all this movie is unforgettable and a must own for all movie fans."
2 May 2020,j_arq,1,1,10,the best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
1 February 2015,Arun145,1,2,10,The Greatest Film Ever Made,"This is a Masterpiece. Tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters, it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however, from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by John Travolta and Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction is perfection. I went into this film with high expectations, I had recently been introuduced to Tarantino through his previous feature, Reservoir Dogs (which was also very good) and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of Hollywoods best, Willis, Jackson, Travolta but there was no need to be as I was delivered a masterclass in film. A very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase, a risky move by Tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it. My belief is it contained his soul. The way in which Tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the least."
3 June 2006,houndtang75,0,2,10,Contender for best film of all time,"It's up there. One of those rare, rare films that you can re-watch many times without boredom, and that you can discover new things in on each viewing, Tarantino came up with something special when he wrote the screenplay for this one. The casting was mostly excellent, with Travolta, Jackson and Willis ideal in their roles. There are some flaws; 'The Bonnie Situation' is a little weaker than the other stories but the diner scene packs a punch; Maria De Medeiros was incredibly annoying as Bruce Willis' girlfriend and Tarantino shows that he's a better writer/director than he is an actor but most of the film is brilliant. The sheer lunacy of the pawnshop S&M kidnap/rape and Christopher Walken's monologue are amongst the highlights. Unsurprisingly Tarantino has found it difficult to follow 'Pulp Fiction'; 'Jackie Brown' was a solid, if overlong thriller but 'Kill Bill' was self-indulgent to say the least."
11 February 2006,movielover1989,0,2,10,"Fast Pace, Great story, Excellent Movie",----------THis has spoilers-----------------Pulp fiction is an awesome movie. it is long but you can't even tell it seems to be only about an hour and forty Five minutes. when in reality its closer to two and a half hours. this movie was great i well every way possible. Jackson and Travolta are great together. Willis pulls off another believable role. and Thurman plays drugged up really well.First this is a segmented movie. the first segment Vincent Vega AKA. Travolta has to take out Marcellises wife (Thurman). this leads to the dance off followed by Thurman OD'ing and then Vincent has to give her an adrenalin shot in the heart.In the second segment entitled the Gold Watch Butch (Willis) needs to get his gold watch back from his apartment and along the way he runs into a hit man Marcellus himself and some gay rapists. this is a great section with a good share of violence.In the third and final section it picks off where the movie began where Jules (Jackson) and Vincent (Travolta) have to get a suitcase of what you can only assume is gold to there boss. Along the way they accidentally blow off some guys head then Wolf (Keitel) helps them get out of that one then they get caught up in a restaurant robbery which Jules decides to take into his own hands.This movie is just great it is a perfect 10 from beginning to end. this is most definitely not to be missed. This is 100% excellent. Watch it.
13 November 2005,rupture10,1,3,10,Best movie ever!,"This movie is my favorite movie because it has amazing writing, excellent acting, the director is the best of his generation, and the cooperation and wit is spectacular!!!!! everyone can relate to these people and the situational irony and suspense ties in perfectly. i like how these people that have never met, cross paths, and connect. Quentin Terentino at his finest with this script and his directing skills, John Travolta's career is reborn with this film, Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for his role, Uma Thurman great as always, Bruce Willis plays the tough all American as usual, and Ving Rahmes is as always the ruthless boss, one other great thing about this film is that is is one of the last things to come out of Hollywood that wasn't work-shopped and commercially exploited till the point that there is no personality or originality to the story this is definitely one of the best films ever, without a doubt, and my personal favorite of all time... enjoy!"
7 September 2021,cwkenreich,0,0,10,Unique,"One of the weirdest movies of all time. Somehow I like it more every time a rewatch it. There are countless monologues and dialogues to keep revisiting. Endlessly quotable and contains a blend of sporadic dark humor and nail-biting scenes of suspense. The morning murder towards the beginning has to be the most memorable gun-to-the-face confrontation I've ever watched. Samuel L Jackson obtains an aura of holiness as he preached Ezekiel 25:17. A major theme in the film is karma; your decisions will come back to reward or punish you, exemplified most clearly with Vincent's anticlimactic death and butch's well-deserved escape from Zed and Marcellus. There were plenty of clues scattered throughout regarding Vincent's demise. One can't help but cringe when he acts impulsively, displays little to no charm around Mia Wallace, downplays Jules encounter with god and carelessly kills Marvin. You realize that his character is selfish and incompetent, which justifies his death. The screenplay did a great job of creating high stakes to keep you invested in the characters: for example, Vincent has to keep Mia alive otherwise Marcellus will kill him, butch has to find his watch otherwise he will lose a family heirloom, Jules and Vincent must clean up Marvin before Jimmy's wife Bonnie comes home. All of it is so well-constructed and pays off."
23 August 2004,ev_snyder,1,3,10,Tarantino at his best! (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),"I, like many others, consider Pulp Fiction to be Tarantino's best film. Pulp Fiction has an excellent story and good directing.  The acting is excellent all around and Travolta gives his finest performance.  What makes this movie really fun to watch, however, is how it's set up.  Pulp Fiction doesn't play like a regular movie; the scenes are all out of order.  There are a few stories going on that have little to do with each other and you get to see where all the stories meet.  At the end you see just how each story affected the other and where they all cross, and how each story point fits in with the next (similar to Kill Bill, in which Tarantino didn't mess up, but just didn't do as good of a job).  But the end of the movie isn't really the end, because you've already seen scenes that take place after the last scene.  The real end of the story is the end of Butch's story, after he already killed Vega, and you might not have realized this until fifteen minutes after the movie was over.  This movie isn't really artistic, but more so clever.  And Tarantino denies any truth about the whole band-aid thing and soul-redemption suitcase, for those of you who can't enjoy a good movie for what it is, or maybe just can't get enough out of this one.  Ving Rhames just has a big ugly scar on the back of his head.Pulp Fiction is easily Tarantino's best work, and possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  All of the acting was excellent, including Tarantino's bit, and Bruce Willis, as little of him as we saw, was a treat.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.  Five stars out of five."
26 May 2013,Sonic_Ocean,0,1,10,Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character,"Funny, philosophical, stylish, violent, and vulgar are some the words I would use to describe Pulp Fiction, along with idiosyncratic due to its unique nonlinear style of telling its story. What I also love about Pulp Fiction is the amount of interesting characters and their witty dialogue. Although this is a crime movie, what makes this stand out from other films in the crime genre is having these characters being placed in the most absurd situations and how they deal with it. This isn't some regular shoot 'em up movie just about people killing other people, it's pretty much its own movie about crime where each situation goes wrong in the most random and strangest way.What I love about Pulp Fiction is that it does not try to make a point about anything, choosing not to take itself seriously. It really comes off as a movie about regular people who talk like regular people talking about some of the most random stuff, but with crime involved. This is especially evident with interactions between Vincent and Jules, which comes off pretty hilarious, since you can tell they're so use to the routine of their job that their having the most random conversations you would expect from two dudes and that's pretty much their way of passing the time before they blow a guy's head off.And the events that follow continue this tone of humor in the most weird or disturbing way. Although this is a crime film, with a lot of dark comedy, I feel Tarantino made a film that feels like a genre of its own and one that feels very post-modern. Although this is not my favorite movie, nor would I consider it the greatest of all time, Pulp Fiction is a film so unique that I don't think I have even seen any other movie that similar to it and because of this, I think everyone should watch Pulp Fiction."
24 December 2005,seventhsamurai1954,1,8,4,Pulp Fiction...Too Good for Words,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that is too hard to categorize or explain simply to somebody who has not seen it. It simply has to be experienced. There are very few movies out there that can be called masterpieces, but I believe that this is the single masterpiece of the 90's (along with Goodfellas). Everything about it speaks brilliance from the music, to the acting, to the dialog and much more. If you see this film and just think that it is overblown action and violence, then obviously you did not understand it. It is actually in the quieter scenes that the profundity of the movie comes out.If you not have seen this epic film, please do so, it will blow your mind and challenge your intellect as well."
12 March 2005,selfparody,0,1,7,The single most uneven movie I've ever seen,"This movie's Decalogue lives up to its reputation for the most part, and the script has some nice little twists that are really entertaining. But dear God, there were several scenes that you just want to skip on the DVD and forget exist.Good Stuff: anything with Roth, Samuel L. Jakcson, and Ving Rhames, whoever played the Heroin dealer.Bad Stuff: the stuff with Thurman/Travolta, the scene with Christopher Walken (which is a real shame: Walken's great)and the stuff with Willis in the Taxi, and Keitel's tragic cameo, where he explains the obvious(this scene is way too long and boring.) I guess you got to expect this with an indie."
20 September 2008,shortround8391,0,1,10,Best movie of the 20th Century,"This is one of those rare movies that will never be forgotten, regardless of what age we will be in the future. I can guarantee that when the time comes when we'll be having flying cars, a vaccine that will obliterate every disease known to man and when the contiential drift makes the world strangely different than it is now, the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" will still be in the public conscious and everyone will still know what it is and what it's about.The best part of the movie for me is the dialogue, and it is without a doubt the best screenplay ever written. Everything that comes out of the characters mouth is so effing cool and that's precisely what makes the characters stand out so well. These guys here are just normal people having normal everyday conversations about what cheeseburgers are called in Paris and how foot massages and having sex are totally different. It also makes some reference to pop-culture that no other film has. And what they always say is a thrill to listen to even though they don't contribute anything to the story.Also, the movie's unusual structure is another high point, it isn't as straight-forward as the other movies are which is why they're boring to watch because you find out what everything is about almost right away. But for this, you're gonna have to watch the whole thing to get the answers to your questions that you think earlier in the movie. Like why did Jules and Vincent have the beach clothes on instead of the business suits they just had on? Or, why was Vincent alone in Butch's apartment and Jules wasn't around? Another purpose for this structure is to clearly describe each characters story like Butch with his watch, Mia Wallace going out with another guy to get a break from her violent crime lord of a husband or Vincent's stupidity and Jules with his odd biblical beliefs.Quentin Tarantino made a masterpiece that surpasses all the Godfather films and the Shawshank Redemption. He basically takes what he did with Reservoir Dogs but made it longer, improved the dialogue and made the characters more deeper. Because of his film-making genius, this WILL stand the test of time forever."

9 December 2014,dana_archer-180-381255,1,2,10,Amazing,"From start to finish this is a true masterpiece. Tarantino is a genius and it comes out in this film. one of the most inspirational films going. Plus the only film that i seen which can make Bruce Willis into more of a bad ass. this has some iconic scenes including when Mia takes Vincent to jack rabbit slim. As well as amazing music. Vincent is funny and the only Q i have is , is Vincent dead or not. EPIC. this lead onto some other great films such as Inglorious bastard's , DJANGO AND many other iconic Tarantino Films. If you want a laugh then this film is for you , if you want a life changing experience this is for you. an all star cast including , Walken . Plummer , Roth , Thurman , Travolta and of course SAMUEL l Jackson"
14 October 2012,MildInconvenienceMan,0,1,9,"This film was all in all something of either pot luck, or sheer genius, but I don't think I'll ever know which one, but all I know is that enjoyed it somehow!","At first after watching this film I thought it was absurdly pointless, and wasn't really too sure why I'd spent the last two and a half hours watching just some peoples lives, but then I realised that, that is the point, the fact that these groups of peoples lives were all interwoven in such a seemingly mundane yet chance like way that it made actually for an interesting film.I'd attempted to watch this film before about, two years ago, but got bored about half way through, although now having finished it, I actually really enjoyed it, but have no idea why... It had all of the classic Tarantino methods woven into it to make it interesting, the stories all inter-locked at different points so that it did not seen too synthetic, just the right amount that it was .... good.Highlights included the role of Samuel L. Jackson, with his amazing speech and ability to stay calm, in hectic situation made his role fundamental for me in the storyline. I also enjoyed Bruce Willis's storyline and how he managed to get out of trouble in the most imaginative way possible, how all of these things happened by chance yet were so random that they could only be by chance is why this film for me was so good.The general feel of the film, of really setting the scene as well as showing the culture of this particular kind of mob, was really interesting to see and helped to make the film such an outstanding thing to behold. Especially its stop start kind of nature, and its kind of chapters or acts which split it up between story lines.This film was all in all something of either pot luck, or sheer genius, but I don't think I'll ever know which one, but all I know is that enjoyed it somehow!"
18 September 2019,khaabd,0,1,8,A symbolic movie par excellence,"This is my first time watching this movie, and I think I'm too late as a Quentin Tarantino fan, For a number of reasons, but after watching the film and despite the length of its duration, I did not feel it at all for the beauty of dialogue and high-end comedy, The film also requires a great focus, and contains many symbols and lack of sequence in the story and the audacity of the dialogues, Also, I can not fail to talk about the fine performance of all the actors and good director, What is wrong with the film is the persistence of a lot in the use of symbols and the presence of scenes have no importance."
19 January 2022,ssvkv,1,1,9,Impossible not to watch,"In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece.Tarantino makes amazing films. Movies that are known to everyone and everyone loves them. Pulp fiction did not differ here.Amazing picture, great emphasis and a good cast of actors. Look and please the eye.What other film boasts so many catchphrases, memorable images and music. Despite the decent bloodiness, everyone should see this picture, and better - in the original. Of course, the most memorable episode is Mia's animation and dancing, but there are a mountain of other funny moments. The same episode with washing the car of blood, where everyone saw the cool Travolta and curly-haired Jackson in some shabby T-shirts and shorts.All the films of Quentin Tarantino make you admire his talent."
31 July 2008,bubbathom,0,1,10,Hard to describe. Great anyhow.,"Pulp Fiction is one of the few timeless movies that I have ever seen. Many people argue about the main message, I think you should just enjoy the movie how it is.Pulp Fiction's about two gangster partners who are retrieving an extremely special suitcase for their boss. In the process, a man shoots 3 bullets at them, but they all miss. One of the gangsters recalls this as a miracle, or work of god, which later makes him decide to retire and simply ""Walk the Earth"". His partner, however, thinks this is a bit dumb and later gets killed by a boxer.This boxer had been payed by the gangster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to lose his fight the night before. He has a dream about the day he received a watch that had been passed down in his family for a long time, and accidentally killed the other boxer. His girlfriend forgot to get his watch from his old apartment, which he knew Wallace was going to inspect, but he knew his watch was important enough to die for. So he got it back, killing one of Wallace's gangsters in the process. He soon meets Wallace himself as they are trapped by a pawn shop owner. The pawn shop owner and his friend start to rape Wallace, and the boxer escapes, but before he does, he kills the rapists with a sword, freeing Wallace, who forgives him a little bit.Two robbers are robbing a restaurant that the two gangsters are eating at. One of the gangsters gives them $1500 and talks to one of them for a long time about a section of the bible. They then proceed to deliver the case to Wallace.The plot weaves together(as the page says) these unrelated people in 4 stories of violence, humor, and guidance.All in all, a wonderful movie never to be forgotten."
15 November 2005,stephen_thanabalan_fans,0,1,8,Its not the greatest film of all time- it is what it is: merely pulp fiction,"Quentin Tarantino's noir-ish and unconventional (contextualising it at its time) postmodern masterpiece did launch the Independent Film industry and put Miramax on the map (spanning a slew of ensuing films in 'Trainspotting' and 'Lock Stock' and circular time-line film structure duplicates in 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Memento') and I agree on all counts that this film is movie-making genius in most ways- from its sheer originality, stylized offbeat nature, slick camera-work, catchy soundtrack (who can forget the Miserlou track) and considering it fathered a genre and was way ahead of its time in 1994 all the way to the fact that it contains a celebration of nuances shared in terms of countless film references ranging Francois Truffaut (Jules et Jim- Samuel L.Jackson's character), Robert Wise (Boxing as the sport of choice for film noir), Robert Aldrich or Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (the hilariously dark 'action' scene between Bruce Willis' character and Ving Rhames' character). I agree that it shaped culture from the 1990s and beyond because it shed light on film-making's ability to function as an underground Americana social commentary, dealing with taboo themes and gritty content but twisting it with a dose of black humor in its eclectic dialogue of rough poetry that plays on ironic wit and borders on poker faced matter-of-fact cynically irreverent pretentiousness. Now, my qualm essentially is that with such a quality film, we can raise critique of it to the level of thematic analyses and subsequently, the broader sense mass pop culture influence that the film through no fault of its own, but given its impact and critical acclaim, invariably glosses over. Whilst 'Redemption' and intervention may be the themes central to the film as evidenced by th story where each character has to make an error, face judgement and then redeems themselves, inasmuch as that helps Pulp Fiction get dubbed as one of the greatest films of all time, and the quintessential nouveaux independent film industry's kick-starter, what I disagree with is that the film's cult status takes it to the point where the film is seen as redemptive in itself as an entity. True the film may deal with all issues from the oddball and in a very rambunctious way make dark humor acceptable, but it does not change the fact that there is an issue not so much with social responsibility (screw that) but more so with a question I have about: purpose. I personally cannot (not that anyone cares about my opinion anyway) in my view give this film top billing because on top of the fact that it deliberately misquotes biblical scripture to prove Samuel Jackson's character was basically a pseudo philosophical inanity designed to flatter to deceive, I actually start to wonder whether that element was a synonymous microcosm of what the film was doing in general- flattering to deceive? And more so because I concomitantly wonder, just what is the point of Pulp Fiction anyway? It carries no greater lacing, no greater meaning, and other than being new and refreshing as compared to the commercial fare grinded out at its time and in the wake of its immediate predecessors, by those tokens could only possibly be a revolutionary film, and not a great film, certainly not as lofty as its accolades thus far have deemed it. Then again, perhaps that too is a rhetorical question given that the quote at the start goes, to deal with ""lurid subject matter"" characteristically put on rough, unfinished paper. Maybe we can substitute paper for film? The problem with this is that I find it serves itself more as an anti-mainstream film (speculating that until 1994 all or most films including the cult classics that it references) proud to linger over its ostensibly 'classic' small stories. It pompously celebrates itself with every element of itself (that I've listed at the start of this review) carrying a touch of over-rated pretentiousness to the film such that it assumes just assembling references to great film styles (now we know Tarantino paid lots of homage to all the great films he watched whilst still a video store clerk) makes it capable of being a top film. In my opinion, this is no fault of the film per se but more so the expectations raised by such an over-rated film. For me, it lacks the heart or element of tragedy that comes with the nature of the content it displays- some say that its very strength- because it has no clear heroes/villains/right/wrongs, but for me that is its weakness - an emotionless diatribe that masks itself very well. Black Masks itself, and that is it- Pulp Fiction- pulp content that fictionally sells more and I accept its critical acclaimed role in modern indie cinema, but it must not be overrated and esteemed more than that.I give it: 8/10"

17 August 2006,rob_gareau,1,2,10,Movies don't get much better than this,"My personal favorite of QT's movies is definitely one of the best movies of the decade. Not only does it have an all-star cast with John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis but the dialogue in the movie made me feel as though it had happened to me just the other day. ""The Royale with Cheese"". Quentin Tarantino obviously knows reality more than any other film maker I can think of.By the expressions and things I have heard from people who have seen this movie I have found out that you either love or hate this movie. You love it because of the reality and bluntness that this movie portrays. You hate it because you can't handle all the drugs and cursing or the dialogue does not appeal to you. This is a movie with no middle opinion.Samuel L. Jackson's character is my favorite character in the movie. He may be a hit-man but he is wise and he knows what he's talking about. If you just listen to the things he says in the movie, you will become a more intelligent person. John Travolta does an awesome job along with Uma Thurman in the restaurant and the O.D. scene. Bruce Willis comes off as a real tough guy but we see his other side in the second chapter of the movie.My personal favorite chapter is The Bonnie Situation for several reasons. Harvey Keitel does an amazing job of portraying the role of Winston Wolfe. The only part I didn't really like in this chapter was QT playing the part. It's my personal opinion that he should stick to film making and not acting.Of course it all comes back to the restaurant robbery which is one of the greatest scenes that Samuel L. Jackson has ever made in his life. Again, listen to everything he says in that scene and you will become a more intelligent person.This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made and everyone that has watched it or will watch it is now a more a intelligent person. Thank You Quentin Tarantino"

I gave it 6 out of 10 and I think it doesn't deserve more than this . Pulp Fiction has 4 connected stories that sometimes it's considered to be 3 ! All of them are good but the Boxer story (Butch) and the Zed scene are really annoying because of ultra violence and rape scene . Tarantino has got a formalistic style of his own . Note these scenes : Hamburger scene , dancing' scene and ... that are really beautiful but some of them are really annoying' for example the scene in which that pierced gal is talking' . Pulp Fiction's message is really beautiful : Returning of the mankind drowned in dirt to what is called God , an almighty power ... . But for me Pulp Fiction is just a good film and not more than this & I'm still wondering' why people like it that much and it's been this much high-rated and if someone has a reasonable answer to this question I beg to send it to me as a message .

                        ",Theories for what is in the briefcase (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER),"A totally amazing film - my favourite, and I've seen it about 10 times because I have it on video. Amazing acting, direction, and the dialogue is the best in any film I've ever seen. But what I'm posting the comment about, is what is in the briefcase that Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is willing to risk his life to protect. There are many theories, but here is my favourite: Marcellus Wallace (the big black guy) has a plaster on the back of his head. This is because he has had his soul removed and he has sold it to the Devil. The soul is in the briefcase (the code for which is 666). The guys who eat the Tasty Kahuna Burgers are Hell's Angels, transporting the soul in the briefcase to the Devil. Jules and Vincent (Jackson and Travolta) are angels, and are out to intercept the soul and return it to Marcellus Wallace. The theory is more intricate, and I do not know where Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel etc. fit in, but that is the bare bones. I advise you to watch the film again, bearing this in mind."
30 May 2020,st_scott-64920,0,0,8,The Quentin-est for sure.,"Of all his movies, this one is the Quentin-est. I'm not gonna tell you what that means exactly because I can't explain either. Call it a genre, a style, a methodology or a spiritual blast if you want.I can't say I love this movie, in fact I felt like I had to sit through the first hour. The build-up is kinda dull and plain for my taste. But then all of a sudden it got good, I think it was around the part where Butch ran into Wallace on the street. The scripture Jule quoted repeatedly is the soul of the movie. It can be simple or philosophical however you choose. That's the beauty.Basically it's about little guys in an ambiguous world painted by aesthetic violence and crude jokes, trying to make a living and search for meaning of life. It's the kind of work that allows you to tap into a more poignant and profound level if you dig hard enough. And if not, you can still enjoy the rush and the deliberate black-and-white pleasure."
29 May 2020,huahongdou,0,0,10,As exciting as a roller coaster ride!,"Demon, charm, madness, unparalleled, When the hair grows black, it is necessary to cut the same hairstyle of a woman, It is wonderful to fall into the soundtrack and close-up, all the excitement, ask who can listen to me in the world. I like you best in all the scenery where things are different."
6 October 2009,moviestar26,0,1,8,LA's Crime Characters,"When this movie released in 1994 it totally redefined the gangster movie genre forever. They can't be a single soul had not seen this movie. By far it became a classic and received cult status and was given many academy awards at the Oscars. Quentin Tarantino became a popular director and the youth were inspired from his movies. However with this movie in particular he caught everyone's attention. Many movies later became inspired from this. Doug Liman's GO and SEVEN DAYS IN THE VALEEY were speculated with pulp fiction style. Hence why many directors were influenced by this movie and attempted to copy its style. Guy Rithie was very inspired by this movie. This was very evident in 'SNATCH'. This movie was a lot like a homage to the gangster genre. Influances of french and Asian cinema are clearly seem in the visuals. It also contained many moments that leads the viewer to watch on in anticipation as to what will happen next. It is an intriguing adventure none the less. This is the genre that I had wished Tarantino had stayed with. 'Reservoir dogs' and 'Jackie brown' were also were also some of his finest works. However his association with Robert Rodriguez led him on to the path of making vampire and zombie movies, which was not really to my taste. Im sure most of his fans may have adored them.**************************CONTAINS SPOILERS*********************** Many of Tarantino's movies have been shot in LA. So there has been no better way to portray the underworld realistically. We are given an insight in to a group of characters, some which are directly and indirectly related to the crime world. The movie is more like a collection of 6 stories collaborated in to one movie. One segment moves to the next. They have a linear pattern but they are shown in a non chronological order. Two hit men 'jackson and travolta' recover a suitcase and kill a boy accidentally in their car. They require quick assistance to to deal with the situation. Later on they go to a diner where the place will be robbed by a couple. We are then introduced to a black gangster's white wife that one of the hit men has to spend an evening with. He saves her life from a drug overdose. Afterwards a boxer turns his back on the gangster he had taken payment from but enters in to a situation whereby he is forgiven. These stories all sum up a 2 day period in LA. *************END OF Spoilers******************************* Upon viewing the movie one will notice that there is not really a plot to bite on. Instead we are witnesses to a number of situations that arise in coincidently and how the characters will pull themselves out of it. We are shown how members of the underworld operate and that they are very organised people. The movie is filled with witty dialogues and scenes of a violent nature. However I have seen korean movies that have depicted more. The movie is high on style and substance but is very character driven. I know LA is a very frightening city to live in and even innocent people can be hurt in gang wars. The movie clearly shows this. A lot of concentration and patience is require in some of scenes, diner scenes especially. Due to the fact they are very conversational. Many scenes are long stretched whereby a little editing would of helped the film. There is no background music in the movie at all. Tarantino instead incorporated music tracks in to many of the scenes to add to the atmosphere. It did not take away any quality what so ever surprisingly. A good example of this was when Butch was going to his apartment. Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, and Samuel L Jackson without a doubt give one of their best performances. However I could not understand what led Rosanna Arquette to do this role. I felt she was wasted.All is said this can surely be an exciting and enjoyable ride for anyone who understands and is a fan of gangster movies. It is nearly on line with 'the godfather'."
25 June 2004,theplanetsmasher1,1,2,10,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"*SPOILERS LIE HERIN* Pulp Fiction is a strait up great movie. The dialogue is witty, the acting fits with the rolls very well, and the connection is genius.Pulp FIction has about 4 stories that all intertwine into one tale. The following is a very vague summary of the events in Pulp Fiction.The First centers on two hit men of Marcellus Wallace going to a drug dealers apartment to take care of some business. It ends as Vinvent Vega and Jules Winfield (the two mob hit men played by Travolta and Jackson) shoot the s*it out of one of the men. It then goes right into another story after a short ""interlude"" type thing. This time, Vega has to take Mia Wallace (Marcellus Wallace's wife played by Uma Thurman) out to dinner. After dinner and winning a twist contest, mia overdoses which evolves into another substory where they must get adrenaline to her before she dies. The following story is called the Gold Watch. This is where one of Wallace's men who is a boxer is paid to throw in a fight. He, however wins and is on the run from Marcellus when he runs into him. This then goes into another subplot where Marcellus and Butch have been taken in by a S&M store owner and Marcellus is raped while Butch escapes only to later come down and save Marcellus. The next story is called the Bonnie Situation where we are back with Vincent and Jules and as they take one of the drug dealers in their car and he is accidentally shot in the face by Vincent. This evolves into the story of how they have to clean up the car and dispose of the body before they get caught. After this they go to a diner where a holdup (the beginning we see in the start of the movie)takes place. This description was very vague and left a lot out but it is hard to fit everything into one paragraph.Anyway, what makes this movie great is the non-linear storytelling combined with the round-about way that the characters are indirectly characterized. Many argue that the ""hip"" conversations do nothing to further their personality, but they fail to see how it actually does. Vincent and Jules' conversation in the beginning about the ""royale with cheese"" seems pointless. But it shows how desensitized to the violent acts they commit. They don't really care at all. There are other examples however i am too lazy to write them all. The movie is reasonably mature in it's content. Upwards of 300 f*cks are used and many sexually implied. There is a lot of sexual content where they talk about oral sex and other things. The violence is not that bad. Not what you see anyway. Someone gets shot in the face and all we see is the blood spatter in the rear window and the blood/brain all over Jules and Vincent. Don't let that, however, turn you off. It is a very good movie that should not be missed. Final Grade: 9.5/10"
19 August 2016,michaeldinan,1,2,9,Pretty amazing...,"My dad went to see Pulp fiction when it came out in theaters. He saw it four more times after that. I had the honor of watching it with him when I finally turned 18 this May. What can I say about it? The screenplay is brilliant, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson , and even Bruce Willis knocked it out of the ballpark, and Quentin Tarantino directing is magnificent! Another draw for me was the fact the movie is not told chronologically, making the viewer focus their attention on what's happening down to the minor details. Often I can watch a film and wait a little bit before watching it again, however Pulp Fiction is a rare exception, since I wanna find out what I believe is in the briefcase. Also you can't go wrong if Christopher Walken makes one amazing cameo. Overall, I think this is a wonderful film. As a product of my generation, and loving this movie, it tells me this movie has aged well, and may continue to get better."
12 November 2006,booyatom,1,4,10,Nu Comedy,"I don't think I've ever laughed so hard during a movie. The brilliant thing about Pulp Fiction, the reason it is so highly regarded, is because it isn't cheap comedy. It's black comedy. Personally, it took me about 2 or 3 seconds after the punchline to actually laugh. I had to think about it. I could picture people seeing it for the first time in 1994, a time when most moviegoers weren't used to as raw, violent and graphic movies as we see today. Not many films leading up to Tarantino's made use of free violence for no moral reason at all but just to laugh. This type of comedy generally makes us ask of Tarantino : ""Can he do that? Is he allowed?"" A perfect example of this is when Jules and Vincent are coming back from a whack ordered by crime boss Marsellus Wallace. They've brought back with them their snitch Marvin. In the car, both hit men are having a lively (and utterly comical) discussion, as is typical of Tarantino characters. Then, Vincent turns around, gun still in hand from the job, and asks Marvin his opinion. All of a sudden, his gun goes off and blasts Marvin's head off. ""Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face,"" says Vincent, to which Jules replies ""Man, I've seen some ****** up **** in my day but this is really ****** up!"" There is no moral reason for this to have happened; it's just a hilarious lead up to the introduction of another hilarious character. Oh and by the way, I almost died of laughter, I'm not joking.All the characters are so original yet so real. Just look at the dialogue. Most of it is unimportant to the plot of the stories in the movie, yet that's what makes Pulp Fiction... Pulp Fiction. The thing is, it's so damn funny. The very first scene we see with Vincent and Jules, a few minutes after the beginning, their dialogue seems quite irrelevant : they talk about the little differences between America and Europe. For example, what we know as a quarter pounder with cheese at McDonalds is called a ""Royale with Cheese"" in Paris. Oh, and they dip their fries in mayonnaise. At first glance, this dialogue is just killing time until something big happens, but with a skillful writer-director like Tarantino, no time is wasted. The said conversation keeps coming back and is useful to understand Jules and Vincent's relationship. This is not the only instance in which there are conversations like these; the whole movie is a goldmine of one-liners and witty conversations that seem irrelevant, but always come backTarantino green-lighted a movement in cinema that was to follow. Of course, the nineties and the eighties before them had their share of violent films : Scarface, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Natural Born Killers and many others. But never had there been a movie that poked fun of people getting killed. Tarantino allowed filmmakers to have fun. Movies like Platoon and Natural Born Killers used violence in an attempt to criticize the behavior. But Tarantino uses it as comedy. There's nothing wrong with that; we can handle it. Bringing his ideas to film, Tarantino touched a sweet spot in film audiences. Nowadays, there are plenty shoot-em-up movies, and we thank our pal Tarantino for it."

                        ",Pulp Fiction break down,"Made with an All-Star cast of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Eric Stoltz, Maria de Medeiros and Bruce Willis, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) is quite unlike any movie I've ever seen before. Focusing on the lives of two hit-men, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a mission to get back s stolen suitcase for their boss, mobster Marsellus Wallace. In the process, Marseuuls asks Vincent to take out his wife, Mia, while he is out of town. Unfortunately, like everything in this movie, things get a little out of hand when it comes to Mia. Pulp Fiction everything from sex to drug overdoses to ketchup jokes"
5 December 2014,tabbyharwood,0,1,9,Pulp Revolution,"This brilliant film directed by Quentin Tarantino gives us a unbalanced cast of intertwined criminals that all eventually cross paths.The mixture of some of my favorite actors include John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman.You have Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Ringo (Tim Roth) robbing a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) in a car discussing burgers, to walking in hallways talking about rubbing feet and having sex. Then Vincent and Jules enter a room and kill men in regards for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). This is when Jules starts resiting bible versus before he kills.Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is seen sitting while you hear off screen speaking which you learn is Marsellus Wallace. Vega is hired to take Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) out while her husband is out of town. The go back to the house where Mia snorts cocaine and passes out. She is later found just about dead by Vega who takes her to a friend to help. Chaos erupts as they try to help her from dying from an overdose.Butch and Maria spend a night together in a hotel making love and then he realizes his watch is missing and he has a fit. He leaves to go get his watch. He arrives at his apartment to the the watch and Vega is waiting for him. Butch kills Vega. Butch leaves his apartment and sees Wallace at an intersection and he hits him but gets into a car accident. Wallace chases Butch and shoots at him and tries to kill him. The fit in a pawn shop. The owner saves Wallace as Butch is about to kill him. He knocks Butch out and makes a call. Wallace and Butch are kidnapped. They are brought downstairs to some underground sex fetish spot. Butch escapes but before he leaves he goes back down for Wallace. Butch walks in and Wallace is getting raped. Due to Butch saving Wallace they makes amends by Butch being told he needs to leave town.The scene goes back to the hotel where Vincent and Jules commits their first kill and it shows them being shot at. They kill the man that comes out of the other room. They take Marvin for a ride and kills him.The get rid of the body of Marvin and end up at a restaurant.The turn of events of end back in the same place where the movie started. All the events leading back to the ending is the beginning of the film. Scene switches back to the beginning of the restaurant robbery. Ringo wants Jules to open the case. He opens the case. Jules turns it around and takes Ringo hostage and then calms down the situation and lets him go. Jules doesn't kill Ringo but rather gives him money to leave the other wallets. He recites a bible verse but doesn't kill him, he breaks the cycle of murder. The ending shows them leaving the restaurant in their shorts, showing you that it is after they were hosed down of blood. Bringing you to the conclusion that the beginning of the movie was the end of the movie."
8 May 2015,Patti-Gaston,0,0,8,Jaw dropping,"Quentin Tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50's themed diner! The overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. This movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. This is a modern classic that should not be missed."
13 May 2015,codymontanye,0,0,8,Great Movie,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is an obvious classic and Tarantino's breakout hit. I felt like it was an odd movie with some scenes that were out of the ordinary and rather questionable. I believe that the way the movie was filmed you could tell that it was a Quentin Tarantino film. The shots used were not just straightforward angles, which made it very visually interesting throughout. I also loved the look of many of the sets that were used throughout the film with my favorite being to 50's diner that John Travolta and Uma Thurman were in. Overall, I found this movie to be very great and I would definitely recommend it to film lovers."
28 September 2005,hatefk,4,7,9,A connection between Kill Bill and Pulpfiction,"I have seen Pulpficion (same as the rest of Tarantino's films) for several times and I liked it a lot. like other Tarantino films , pulp fiction have some signatures of QT and also some mysteries to find. I don't know if anyone has noticed the one I think I've found or , not. when Vincent Vega and Mia are in the restaurant , Vincent asks Mia about her pilot role in a TV show. Mia answers that we were five assassins, I was specialist in swords , a blond was our team leader , a black girl was a professional in explosives , a Japanese girl was a karate expert and a french girl was sex expert.( I don't remember the words exactly but I'm sure about the content and the profession of each girl)we can link this sentence to kill bill where Budd and bill are talking about Kiddo's skill in swords. In kill bill 1 we saw that copper head attacked kiddo with a gun , and also kiddo says that the French girl Sophie was one of bills assassins. if we assume that Elle was the leader of the assassin girls, we can easily conclude that Mia was talking about the "" DEADLY VIPER ASSASSINATION BAND"" in kill bill. because we can assume that the french girl who was the Sex expert(mentioned in pulp fiction) was Sophie Fatale in Kill bill.I hope this one was exciting and useful to you."
3 February 2007,anchorman360,0,2,10,Very Good But somewhat Overrated,"When Pulp Fiction came out in 1994 it was nominated for best picture but lost to ""Forrest Gump"". It put John Travolta's career back together, made Samuel L. Jackson a big star and made director Quinten Tarintino even more famous. This movie is currently on #8 on the top 250 list which is too high for a movie like this. Bruce Willis is also in this but he was already well known for the ""Die Hard"" series. It follows three different stories in a 24 hour period in LA. There are some parts that are really good. My favorite one is Travolta and Jackson's conversation in the car right before it is revealed that they are both hit men who work for a man named Marcellus played by Ving Rhames. Another part that I really enjoyed was after Travolta's character accidentally shoots a guy in the head and both of them must get rid of the body with the help of the wolf(Harvey Keitel) and Jimmie (Tarintino). So this is a movie that you will most likely enjoy even though it does get boring at times."
8 May 2014,ctladybird,0,1,10,Do not fall asleep during this movie! You will miss a lot!,"I fell asleep the first time I saw this film (It was 3am when we started watching) and I woke up confused as hell. However this film is one of Tarantino's best. A sort-of prequel to ""Reservoir Dogs"" This film is one of pop culture's immortal beings in the world of film. The setup of the film reminds me a lot of Guy Ritchie, and perhaps the two directors were influenced by the other. An awesome action packed bloodbath that is Tarantino's trademark, Pulp fiction is a must-see for any movie buff. This is the film that launched Uma Thurman to stardom, and the only film where you will see Bruce Willis fight a gimp. You cannot go wrong with this movie at all in the slightest."
9 May 2014,Dollardave86,0,1,9,Star studded,"This is truly one of the greatest crime/drama films of all time. When I was going up I never saw the movie, just some of the action clips. The Pulp Fiction poster might be more famous then the actual movie. This film has to be hands down Tarantino's master piece, it had everything from action, humor,and originality. We must not forget about how great the performances were from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta,Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis. I would definitely recommend this too all my friends.The many stories of this film, Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order, not to leave confusion but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialog between characters."

                        ",Pulp Fiction (1994),"Pulp Fiction (1994) was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. This film is both comedic and also has violent scenes as well. I love the cast that was chosen for the movie. The leading characters are some of my favorite. The movie stars, John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson.There are many twist and turns to this movie. First you have two hit men who are on patrol to retrieve a stolen briefcase (who run into a few mishaps along the search). A fighter, Butch Coolidge, who is suppose to lose his fight, however that doesn't go as planned either...He ends up killing his opponent. And is now on the run from the crime boss...I am not a huge fan of Quentin Taratino. I just don't understand his style of directing. However I would recommend this film to others, just so they can have their own opinion."
7 December 2014,jferraro3,0,0,9,Pulp Fiction,"This is hands down one of the most interesting films you will ever watch. It earns an easy spot on almost all top movie lists. There is never a dull moment in a Tarantino film and this movie comes through with a crazy amount of plot twist as he has done in so many other great films. This movie will filled with power packed cast that all really delivered. This film is witty,gory, and yet still can warm your heart at times. This movie has so many memorable quotes mainly due tot the superb acting job by the always great Samuel L. Jackson. The action is off the charts and this film is full of Tarantino's typical gory and dramatic cinematic effects. Tarantino is truly one of the masters of expressing realistic violence on film. This movie is a bit confusing the first time through but after you grasp whats going on and how this story is being haphazardly told to you it is one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences. This mish-moshed story telling is common for a Tarantino. It would not even be fair to label this movie in a genre because this movie does so much. It takes you on a ride through every emotion and movie genre you can imagine. A true masterpiece."
7 September 2014,luisgomt,1,1,10,About Pulp Fiction,"Probably the most bizarre movie I've seen.Too real. I stayed focused the whole movie. A movie different from the others, if you have not seen ... do not expect a movie convectional. His actors are great.Great deal, Samuel L. Jackson, Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and others. P. D. Tarantino did not really like him, but his irreverence breaking the mold in the way we produce is a genius. Strong, Real Scenes, Some Comedy. I do not want to launch any spoiler. Only recommend as movie icon of the 90's I remember one afternoon I saw by chance among to her. No plan to see it. The result? Excellent. Screen somewhat opaque. Something retrograde. Very long so if. Not for minors. Disfruntela."
19 December 2012,kendraocon,0,1,7,I thought this movie was pretty good,"This movie I couldn't really tell what lighting they used, I think it was low key. There weren't intense shadows, so maybe some of the scenes used high key lighting. The lighting seemed like natural window light, not artificial lighting. They use interesting angles and perspectives in their scenes. The hamburger scene for example, the the angles and perspective are switched to the black man to the white man, to the burger to many more. The low angle of the black man I think was done to show the power and control he has over the white man and that he is much stronger and larger then the small white man sitting down. The car shot of John and the black man, the camera angle switches back and forth to both men talking it doesn't show both of them in the same shot together until the scene is almost over and even then one is not in the focus."

                        ",Mind Boggling,"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of all time. Whenever I watch a movie that keeps me thinking about meaning for weeks, I know its a good one. I have watched it several times and really attempted to embrace all the aspects of the film. What is most noticeable and significant about the film is its extremely unorthodox presentation of the story. Different parts of the plot are shown out of order during the screen duration. There are essentially three different stories being told that are all in some way connected. Furthermore, there is such a vast amount of symbolism, indirect implications, and metaphors the meaning of the film is very ambiguous. To try review all the different thoughts I have regarding the films significance and meaning would take several pages. In a basic sense I think there is a lot of redemption going on in the film. Jules redeems himself by not killing the restaurant their, Butch redeems himself by saving Marsellus, and Marsellus redeems himself by allowing Butch to live and escape L.A. like he planned. Note that all these characters are alive when we pursue the plot duration is over. Vincent is a key character behind the theory the movie could be about redemption. At no point in the film does Vincent indicate he wishes to make more constructive or morally conscious decisions. We know that Vincent is later killed when he is sent to assassinate Butch. Perhaps his lack of enlightenment is the reason his character does not live and the other who make decisions that defy there stereotypical self remain alive. Regardless the most significant aspect of the film is the fact the meaning is so ambiguous and the story is told in such a scrambled manner."
16 January 2008,Gameboy2007,1,4,5,Not a bad movie but it's completely overrated.,"A lot of people claim it's one of the best movies made. I for one may be blind to that. It might not be the movie for me. I'm not saying it's bad since I know a bad movie when I see one; it's just that I found many parts of the movie completely dull and boring. The storyline is complexed and I'll admit, I didn't understand all of it simply because it didn't keep me interested. If a movie's story does not capture my interest, I will take some points off for that because that's what movies are suppose to do.One thing I did like about the film is that it mixed the storyline up. As an example, the beginning scene in the movie was actually near the end in the real time line. It basically mixed all the story lines up. They didn't go in the right order. Pulp Fiction is structured around three distinct but interrelated story lines in Tarantino's conception. However I had mixed feelings about each of the main three story lines. The main story that involved Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife was extremely boring in my opinion. I'm not into watching people do drugs and talk because that's what most of that scene was. Only the end of that story was a little interesting. That whole scene overall dragged on for nearly a half hour which really killed some of my interest.The Gold Watch scene gave me mixed feelings. The beginning where Butch was with his girlfriend at the hotel was again very dull and boring. Once he left the apartment and you see the mess he gets into, it gets a little more interesting. The crazy scene that follows almost made the movie worth watching. Finally, the very end of the movie, which actually started at the beginning(yes it maybe a little confusing)was probably the most interesting scene in the movie. Overall, the plot is very complexed. Many people may like the story's setup and content. I for one am not exactly crazy about watching people do drugs for 20 minutes; then watch people talk in a hotel for another 20. While the storyline has good writing and the ideas behind it are very good, there are too many scenes that drag on for too long. There were only a few interesting scenes that really kept my interest. However, this was a well casted movie that had very good acting.Overall the movie had good production value and it will be enjoyed by some people. People who like mobster and drug content will probably enjoy it. However, there were just simply too many scenes that dragged on. This movie is definitely not for everyone. However it is very overrated because it does not stand above other movies as one of the best like the way critics in the past made it sound."
29 July 2019,leobrodin,4,21,1,Pointless violence with excessive swearing for what.,"I just watched this for the first time. It's just extremely pointless and plotless, except for 30 minutes. It does not build up to any big finale in any way, it just exists. It's like a diary, simple documentation of what happens with no existing reason.It has four different plotlines in it, wowen together by including some of the same characters. Each could be a tv episode of some show. These plotlines would be equally ""good"" if they had completely different characters. One of them might be worth seeing. The other ones are diaries.Tarantino plays around with chronology ... so what? It made it neither better, nor worse. Just pointless.It has an extreme amount of swearing -most sentences, literally- and violence. Not necessarily a bad thing but definitely not a good one by default either. Just tedious in this case. If the violence was exciting like some shootout this movie could have been worth seeing as braindead action. However it is almost only executions with no drama.Bruce Willis character Butch has a decent plotline and was a bit exciting as it wasn't obvious how everything was going to end. With some improvement it could be a decent short movie on its own. With a lot of improvement perhaps a decent longer movie.There is one more scene where a character has a moral decision to make that might be worth seeing. There is no point in seeing the remaining 100 minutes.This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. It is nothing like The Room, for example. As it is currently the 8th highest rated movie on imdb it is however by far the most overrated one that I have ever seen. I would give it two or three stars for the Butch storyline if I didn't feel like the average has to be lowered as much as possible due to the current absurd 8.9.One last thing: The hit man that John Travolta plays is sometimes just more of a braindead a**hole (the only word I can come up with to describe) than what is possible.Everything in this review is of course opinions but I almost dare say most of it is opinions that are common sense."

                        ",Pulp Fiction?,"""Does he look like a bitch?"" proclaims Jules, the character played by Samuel Jackson. Holding a gun in one hand and a suitcase in the other, he repeatedly berates and interrogates his victim. The victim stutters in response. ""English, motherf*cker, do you speak it?"" Jules yells again. Vincent (the character played by John Travolta) rests easily on the wall as if this was nothing new to him. Before inevitably killing the poor man, he lashes out another series of vulgar yet shockingly hilarious slur of swears, punch lines, and bible quotes before pulling out his gun and shooting him to death. These quotes are not merely for shock value, and they are spoken in the climax of the movie. They appear within the first 20 minutes of the movie, and are some of the most quotable lines in movie history.This movie isn't intended for children. If the R-rated warning didn't already give that much away. The movie contains many instances of drug use and profanity. Although it is a movie about hit-men and the drug business, the central themes of the movie do not completely center around it. There is a deeper meaning to the movie itself. Not just every violent, gangster drug related movie can make it to top-ten movie lists (IMDB rates it number 5). While this movie is for adults, it's also for the more intellectual audience. Morons will be attracted to the movie through its violence and profanity, but intelligent people will walk away with much more. The time line of the movie itself is jumbled and isn't portrayed in the way everything happened, and that alone takes time to figure out. The symbolism of Bruce Willis's struggle to get his golden watch is not many will pick up on. Not to mention the symbolic right vs. wrong roles played by Jules and Vincent that inevitably lead to their separate fates. The characters, despite their rash language and dangerous professions all have redeeming qualities and are constructed individually and interestingly. Samuel Jackson, or ""Jules"" is more or less the main character who travels around with his companion Vincent doing various tasks for Marsellus Wallace(Played by Ving Rhames). Though all characters carry the same profession, all of them are different in their morals, attitudes, and composure. It doesn't come up until later in the movie, but what separates Jules and Vincent are their decisions whether to stay in the business or leave. This ultimately leads to Vincents death as he chooses to continue his involvement with Marsellus. Jules, being the more superstitious of the two, reaches a ""moment"" of clarity early in the time line of the story which enacts him to change his ways as he believes that a ""higher power"" is telling him to quit. Vincent and Jules contrast with each other, which in turn makes them the perfect combination. Vincent, more reserved. Jules, more sporadic. Vincent, a heroin addict. Jules, a clean man. Vincent, calm, cool and collected. Jules, loud and controlling. All characters intertwine themselves and hold various attitudes to each other that amount to gore, violence, death, and even rape. No character is looked down up on.The movie itself carries many references to pop culture and the movie is constructed around such. Vincent keeps his hair long and in a pony tail and Jules keeps his in a jerry curl – two styles relevant to earlier times (not to mention these hair styles somewhat reflect their characters). The movie for the most part is fairly present, if not a decade earlier than the year it was produced (1994). The music is mostly older music – from the 1960s and 1970s – and no real original score exists as any music played is from these periods in time. At one point in the movie, Vincent takes Marsellus's wife on a date (not a real date, just ""good company"" as he puts it) to a 1950's diner where many famous celebrities can be pointed out, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. The music is mostly American rock music, and it is fitting to a story that is very much American."
10 November 2009,Amym-24,0,2,5,Most Confusing Film to Date,"American culture has changed significantly throughout the decades.What was once a peaceful society where families were living in nice houses and a clean, safe neighborhood where drug overdoses, robberies,gangs, and murders weren't a concern.Today,in times of recession or desire,people will find other ways of obtaining money and valuable items,and giving illegal drugs to obsessive users through the use of robbery,trading, and murder. It is not necessary to harm other people for no reason, as a result of greed or desire. It's important to redeem yourself from a life of crime and focus on turning yourself around into a whole new good direction into doing the right things in life.Although the acting was portrayed well throughout the film by Willis, Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman,and the use of the cinematography and lighting was excellent,the screenplay written for this movie was horrible!! The plot duration and the screen time dragged on and on throughout the movie,giving the film the feeling that it's never going to end in most scenes. The juxtaposition of the present and past alternative plot twists were confusing to follow and it would have been better if the plot flowed through smoothly through one storyline. The offensive language in the film was overused too much in every scene.The use of the cinematography was excellent. The cinematographer's use of natural and non-naturalistic lighting, contrast, and shadows were used well in the indoor scenes. The cinematographer's use of the close ups, crane shots, long takes, dolly shots were all used to create suspense, and make the viewers wonder what's going to happen to the major characters in the film."
22 October 2008,nilesrules1980,1,2,10,Yes QT,"This is how to make a film. Quentin Tarantino, whatever you think of him, is a genius. With Pulp Fiction, he single handedly changed how films would be made for years to come. QT was the first person to do the whole cross referencing story arch's right. This film essentially is three stories that all come together at several points and it works OH so well.This film has everything - incredible acting, great black humour, great plot lines, decent action and lots of gore. Everyone in this film delivers an incredible performance, all worthy of Oscars (Samuel L. Jackson being my favourite).Comedy. In this film, you almost feel guilty for laughing. Whilst there are some genuinely hilarious lines, most of the humour is VERY dark and not for the light hearted. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta's breakfast scene is easily one of the funniest moments in cinema history, whilst at the same time creating a great atmosphere of suspense and unease.Overall, this film is incredible - it truly is. Pulp Fiction should be seen by ANYONE who wants to go down the route of writer/director, as QT puts on an absolute master class.If you want to see why Mr Tarantino is as famous as he is, watch this film. You'll see he deserves his credit.*****"
27 April 2009,loukosrotten,1,2,10,One of the best of it's kind,"First of all one must understand from the very beginning the kind of this film or else he may be disappointed... This film is in no account to be taken seriously as it has no opinion in important social or personal matters and it's primary goal is to be a lot of fun. And it achieves this goal. It is stunningly fun, using violence but also stupid meaningless dialogs! The discussions about the proper way to ask for a quarter pounder with cheese or a big-mac in France are brilliant in their stupidity as well as samuel jackson's simplistic approach on god and travolta's also simplistic arguments show lots of intelligence from quentin. Also the brilliant and original way the director made this film show that he has a rather deep knowledge of cinema, art and more specifically directing. On the whole it was a wonderful violent comedy making a must-see for one who likes the kind. And remember in case you go to France: LE BIG MAC."
15 September 2004,ROSS4152K,1,2,10,Excellence accompanied with scathing originality,"SPOILERS in this summaryThis film is arguably the most well-written of all time. Quentin Tarantino's screenplay includes everyday conversation that enhances character development. There are no lulls since every piece of dialogue has a certain significance to the entire film.Pulp Fiction is also not as violent as some critics think. Take for instance the scene at Lance's house when Mia is suffering from a heroin overdose. Vincent stabs Mia with an adrenaline needle to jump start her heart. However, (thanks to brilliant directing from Tarantino) the viewer never actually sees the needle penetrate Mia's chest. The best scene in Pulp Fiction has to be the end scene in which Jules (played by Samuel L. Jackson in his career role) negotiates with Pumpkin and Hunnybunny with regards to saving their lives. His last lines interpreting Ezekiel 25:17 are powerful and spine-tingling, especially his last sentence.""You're the weak, and I am the tyranny of evil men, but I'm trying', Ringo, I'm trying real hard to be a shepherd."" This speech makes Pulp Fiction one of the greatest and most unique stories of redemption.Pulp Fiction is personally my favorite film. The movie earned its Oscar for Tarantino's screenplay, but was denied Oscars it should have won, especially best picture, best director (Tarantino), and best supporting actor (Samuel L. Jackson). Regardless, this film is extremely important with blazing originality similar to Citizen Kane. It is a film that will continue to thrive for many decades to come."
21 April 2013,teacher-katiano,1,2,10,A 20th century masterpiece,"The intelligent cut from the editor Sally Menke working with the master Quentin Tarantino, has just made a movie worth watching over and over to enjoy each particular scene, a tribute to everyone who likes movies and good music, a puzzle just possible to be done by watching more than once in order to memorize those amazing quotes, quotes like ""I do believe Marsellus Wallace, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted. Now I want to dance, I want to win. I want that trophy, so dance good."" A scene that makes us travel in time to gold Ed Sullivan's time or to Grease, great lines that just Tarantino's at his best could deliver, tomato joke, hamburgers, 5 dollar shake, watch hidden in the ass, sword and memorable characters, surely my top 10 best movies ever made."

                        ",Great Tarantino film,"This was a very unique film. Tarantino's work is told in a series of flashbacks that are not in chronological order, which causes some confusion, but not enough to ruin the experience of the film. The story is interesting in that it follows the ""bad guys"", a group of men who work for a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace. The film is also divided into sub parts, which are indicated by a break in the filming. These sub parts tell the individual stories of those who are connected to Wallace and how they connect to one another. The acting throughout the film is also top notch. While Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play the most prominent roles in the film; some of the best acting comes from the side characters in the film such as Uma Thurman. I would highly recommend this film to all movie lovers, as it combines several film elements such as violence and comedy and ties them together in unconventional ways."
8 May 2014,Bcrosier1674,0,1,10,This Film is Royal... With Cheese,"Where do I start with this film? Quentin Tarantino made me a fan for life with this film, and the way the story is told hearkens back to ""The Killing"" by Stanley Kubrick, with all of the broken up episodes, all leading to a Mexican stand-off in a diner. This film has created so many memorable moments in my mind, and some of which have been ingrained in pop culture as well. This film can be seen as the revitalization of one John Travolta, which he won Best Actor with his role of Vincent Vega. Samuel l. Jackson, however, is absolutely gold in this film, from quoting biblical verse to asking for his wallet, he delivers in the film non-stop. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and for good reason. You don't want to see this film, you NEED to."
7 September 2014,dnamyt,1,1,10,no to bad,"Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic."
17 January 2007,gfourmil,0,1,7,hardly Tarantino's best,"there's one reason i love this flawed film---marsellus---his portrayal of a true 'fundamentalist preacher' hidden away as a hit-man keeps my 'fast-forward' or 'rewind' digits sore. my beefs, with what so many feel is such a classic? first, one could edit much out---the dance scene, the overdose scene---and absolutely re-edit walken's 'bit-part'---truly tasteless, totally predictable---but i guess 'work-is-work', not to be passed on---but to see him, myself a true lover of his great 'the dogs of war' just wasted on a brief 'walk-in' bit of scatology? ridiculous.and unlike 'natural born killers', where-to-hell is any 'message'---other than a simple mess? none---as 'kill bill'. to me, mr. Tarantino's best was 'jackie brown'---a flawless work nobody seems to notice vs. this.if were not for marsellus as a splendid crazed black preacher, with a big gun? i wouldn't bother. he steals the show---makes it worth the bunk, and blister on my index-finger."
11 December 2012,ninowalsh,0,1,9,Awesome,"It's difficult to point out exactly what makes Pulp Fiction one of the best motion pictures in existence. It just is. The brilliant writing, the spot-on cast, the simple plot with the unpredictable turns - all combined with the calm and contrasting atmosphere that characterizes Tarantino's work - all adds up to nothing less than one of the most flawless drama of all time. In particular, the scene at Jack Rabbit Slims is my favorite. It's just a fun scene Steve Buscemi plays a laughable Buddy Holly server, and John Travolta can't get over how there could be a five dollar shake. Also before Uma Thurman and John Travolta enter the restaurant, Uma say, ""Don't be a square."" I don't think many viewers understand what that means because the term was popular in the 60s. It means don't be un-hip or uncool."
13 May 2015,h-macherone,0,1,6,Pulp Fiction,"Very strange film but one to be expected form Quentin Tarantino. I am typically a fan of the majority of QT's films but the film proved to be a little too much for me. It may have been that I was not expecting such content from of film that was this old. Usually when I see a film closer to ""my time"" I am pretty confident in what to expect in general terms of filming but also the extent of the content.The collaboration of actors was nice and the on screen chemistry was entertaining. These are all actors I think that work well together.This film to me really interested me in terms of color usage. Not entire why this but I feel that many of these colors were intentional within certain scenes.I enjoyed being taken into 4 different stories of violence and vengeance. Not sure if this is a film id like to see again, at least not for a while."
19 March 2014,alessio-bertotti,1,1,10,The best example of narration,"It is a great movie because you can see it in two ways: as a normal spectator, enjoying the scenes, the story and the sketches and as a really accurate spectator, trying to keep in mind all the little details, understanding all the connections between facts, words and characters. If you watch it this way at the end of the movie, when you realize the correct time order of the scenes, you notice that you missed so many details and you want to start the movie again, watching it with another point of view. It does not matter how many times you watch the entire film, there are always new details and links you may discover. The characters are great, with a good balance between action, fun, serious moments and drama. A really must see film that defines a cinematographic style."
30 May 2006,StayPuft003,0,3,10,No doubt.,"Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made. It is perfect in almost every way. It's dialogue is the best ever to hit the screen: witty, charming, and it has ""MEMORIZE ME"" written all over it. It is wacky and original. From Jules and Vincent in their rants about McDonald's to the completely different Butch dealing with a group of rapists, every second of this movie is meant to be there. Tarantino, the brilliant movie maker that he is, does not waste one line, one action, or one of anything else you can think of. This movie is the only movie that I can watch over, and over, and over again, and it never loses steam, no matter how many times I see it."
22 August 2006,PresFos2007,1,2,10,Quentin is a GENIUS!!!,"In reality, Pulp Fiction is one of the most disorganized movies of all-time, but it was brilliant. To show all of those characters stories of a period of days and how they were connected was cool. Jules is the most dynamic character of all of the them and he makes the movie. I would have nominated him for the best actor Oscar. This movie showed Samuel L. Jackson at his best and funniest. Jules was dynamic by incorporating violence with religion. Vince resurrected John Travolta back on top. Vince was the cool junkie. Vincent Vega showed us that eating someone out can be just as sensual as giving a foot massage. Stroke of Genius. Butch was also a one of a kind character. Butch has major problems to go through because he's on the run from Marcellus Wallace and his men and the irony of it is that he beat the mess out of him and saved him from more humiliation by the pawn shop owner and the cop Zed. His girlfriend even had a moment of shine by talking about blueberry pancakes, and losing Butch precious watch that was his father's. Quentin Taratino is a genius for creating a movie this versatile and probably one of the greatest crime films ever. This is a must-buy movie and a movie you will never forget."
18 November 2008,sucks-9,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino is well known for his graphic violence, his 70s soundtracks, his pop culture references, his ensemble casting, and his non-linear story telling. Pulp Fiction is by far the best example of all of these Tarantino trademarks to be rolled into one amazing film. From the opening scene in the Restauraunt between Honey Bunny and Pumpkin to the ending where we once again meet up with Honey Bunny and Pumpkin again in the restauraunt through the characters of Vincent and Jules. The music is superbly chosen by Quentin Tarantino and the dialogue is incredibly original (my favourite line of course being: ""Do you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?""). Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made by Quentin Tarantino."
19 December 2012,hollywoodjohnny,0,1,10,One of the best,"Pulp Fiction, 1994Another amazing film. Tarantino's style really formed off of this as well as his previous ""Reservoir Dogs"" and has stuck ever since. This film was so mesmerizing to me in so many different ways. The dialogue is so amazing in this movie, in the sense that the characters have so many ""regular"" conversations throughout the film that really have nothing to do with the movie sometimes but Tarantino does it in such a way that makes it so interesting. For example, when they're talking about the Big Mac in Europe in the beginning, it really has nothing to do with the movie, but then we see Jules taunt his victim with this little tid bit before killing him. So many different aspects of this movie have been parodied, duplicated, or replicated and that makes it even more hyped. I really loved this movie and have shown it to so many people who have also enjoyed it. I recommend this to all mature audiences."
21 February 2015,masterandoverlord,1,10,4,One word describes this movie...,"...and that word is ""overrated."" As with the other Tarantino movies, Pulp Fiction is a douchey movie made for 20-something douche-bags. Like the rest of Tarantino's films this is pure Pop Culture garbage. The opening scene features two of the worst actors in the history of cinema: John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Several of the cast members do a respectable job despite the drivel they were given to spout. The story is just ridiculous and seems like it was written by a twelve-year-old. There are many, many mistakes in the filming of this garbage excuse for a movie, just check the ""mistakes"" and ""goofs"" section of the movies main IMDb page."
19 June 2022,jfrakes-52265,1,2,10,Innovative and Unique; A Tarantino Staple,"No one was ready for the genius of Pulp Fiction but it revolutionized filmmaking. Quentin's use of nonlinear storytelling was absolutely phenomenal. There are many times where the timeline goes back and forth and there are even different stories in general (even though they all somewhat connect together). Pulp Fiction has different stories and it is still a masterpiece. That is crazy.This entire film was absolutely amazing from the beginning to the very end. The way that it cut from the two robbers starting their act to the opening credits was astounding. Tarantino always picks great music, but this may have been his best selection yet because from that very song, I knew exactly what type of film it was going to be.Also, the dialog is great. Even though I feel that dialog is one of the least important aspects in a film, Pulp Fiction's dialog is extremely respectful and the deliveries from the actors make it so much better. Every single word that Jules, who was played by Samuel L. Jackson, said was genius.Then there were iconic moments left and right. There was the dance sequence between Vincent and Marsellus Wallace's wife, Jules with his speech early in the film, the robbery, and so much more.Before Tarantino made this masterpiece, the world had not seen anything like it. Since Tarantino made this masterpiece, the world has seen nothing else like it."

16 June 2020,l-59417,0,1,8,a brief evaluation,"A masterpiece of non-linear narrative cinema. The structure is clever and full of deep meaning, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but are hopeless toward darkness and confusion. Each paragraph is not divided into ends and ends, complementary structure, beginning and end connected, suggesting that in reality similar to the movie plot always happen, never stop."
2 February 2022,TheUnholyPeanut,0,0,9,Tarantino's ultimate masterpiece.,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the last 25 years. With an impeccable filmography with masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, and Kill Bill, he has had a very illustrious career. But it was not until Pulp Fiction, his magnum opus, that we get to see his true skill.First, we will start out with the script. Pulp Fiction is widely considered to have one of the greatest and most unique scripts of all time. One of the reasons for this is because of the non-linear narrative, which rarely a director tries (However, Memento and Reservoir Dogs, his first film, both succeeded in this technique as well.) Mostly, only literature does this, such as Catch-22, so it was very unique for a film to do this so impeccably. The reason this film has a non linear narrative is so the audience can slowly pick up the pieces and find all the deeper nuances of the characters and multiple plots, yes, the script also has very compelling interweaving plots as well, although it mostly focuses on two hitmen, Vincent and Jules. Another reason the script is so great is because of the dialogue, which feels extremely natural and realistic, and not forced, making you feel like these events actually happened. The script also has various interpretations, which I will not get into, and complex symbolism like the golden briefcase, which can be interpreted in so many different ways.The impeccable script is also further improved upon by the spectacular performances in this film. Samuel L. Jackson gives his best performance as Jules, in which he shows his true skill. He seems extremely realistic in this movie, and some of his line deliveries for the dialogue are superb, especially the Bible quote, which is a superb scene. His screen presence and charisma in this film is also great as he really makes the entire film so great, and makes Jules such an amazing character. John Travolta, whose career was dying out before this film, also gives a great performance as Vincent. He also seems extremely realistic and has really great line deliveries, such as his blasé delivery of the ""I shot Marvin"" scene to him talking to himself in the mirror. He is great in every scene he is in. Everybody else such as Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kristen, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames also gave a phenomenal. Every actor in this film arguably gave off their greatest performance ever.This film also shows Quentin's skill as a director, even when he was young. Quentin masterfully directs a lot of scenes like the Dance scene for example which is one of my favorite scenes in the entire film. There are also some incredibly beautiful and interesting shots, such as the shot of the opening of the golden briefcase, or the dance scene (which is such a greatly directed scene improved upon by the script.) Tarantino also uses his aesthetic of violence, seen in his first film, in his directing in the movie a lot. He does this because it's not just for violence, because violence is the voice and force upon the narrative, he uses it to bring out very different emotions. This film mostly fortified Quentin's skill as a director, and it really does show in this movie. The soundtrack is also great and really fits the tone and feel of the film.Overall, Pulp Fiction does indeed deserve all the praise it gets, because of its almost flawless script, with a non linear narrative and various interpretations, superb performances and great characters, and great direction and cinematography. The film really does deserve all of its praise. 9/10."
17 January 2022,swmoncur,0,0,8,Royale with cheeeeeese,"This movie ages better the longer I think about it (it's been three days now since I watched). Wildly entertaining from start to finish. The unpredictability that we have come to associate with Tarantino is present throughout and give it that unique flavor of satisfaction. It reminded me of a loose hybrid between Fargo and The Big Lebowski. Dark comedy with a more-than-healthy dose of violence.As with most, if not all, Tarantino films, the plot is out of left field and is filled with unexpected twists and turns. This is compounded by the fact that you're following three unique storylines (not in chronological order!) whose common thread is largely unclear until the end of the movie. It does come together in the end, which showed the genius of the plot and helps to fully appreciate the bizarre, yet crafty, storyline.Samuel L Jackson especially stood out in his role, accompanied by strong performances by Travolta, and Willis. The character interplay was amusing throughout and really kept you glued to the screen. There are several iconic scenes that I can tell will always stick out in my mind: the hamburger / apartment interrogation scene, the date night dinner and dancing scenes with Travolta and Uma Thurman, the ""Royale with cheese"" dialogue, and the epic diner showdown at the end with Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Some awesome lines throughout.The piecing together of the film was among the best aspects IMO. The shattered start, followed by a winding journey that makes the viewer wonder if there is any cohesion at all, ending with a bang. The rollercoaster experience is what makes it so enjoyable, and creating such a well-designed rollercoaster is no easy feat-so kudos to Tarantino and company for such an entertaining ride."
8 April 2007,kmillervir,0,2,10,"Truly a movie, that can never be surpassed","Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movie ever created. Tarantinos abilities as a movie director and writer reach their climax in this intense emotional epic. The movie uses dialogue and emotion that leaves you breathless afterwards. And after you have watched it several times, you can go back and realize. There is nothing fancy about it, ill use the drug overdose scene as an example. There is no music, barely any sound effects, no highly technical camera operations, and yet, its one of the most exciting and energetic scenes in all of cinema. The realness of every scene is amazing. Its hard to imagine what it would be like to have an overdosed dieing girl in your house, and trying to give her an adrenaline shot before she croaks, but after watching this movie, you realize what it would be like. Samuel L. Jackson gives his best performance by far, and Travolta is also perfect for his role. it seems like everything that directors and movie makers try to accomplish and put together, are in this movie. everything thing fits in perfectly, creating a visual masterpiece. If you don't like this movie, you don't like movies at all."
22 September 2006,Deefabb,1,4,10,I love this movie!,"This picture changed my life! I saw Pulp fiction first in 1996. I was laughing. I fell in love to this picture at once. After survey i changed stiles in my clothes, my outlook. After Pulp fiction many good movies were destroyed for me. And the soundtrack... It's incredible! Development of characters are very very nice. Especially outstanding acts Samuel L. Jackson. His role is cult for generation were born 70-80s. Outstanding execution of character Mia Walles by Uma Thurman. Great execution character Lance by Eric Stolz. Oh-Oh-Oh...editing by Sally Menke... It without words...without!!! Academy took only seven nominations... It's too little. I remember Oscar ceremony 1995-th year. How battled three outstanding pictures: Forrest Gump, Pulp fiction, The Shawshank Redemption...I was thirteen years old. I root for Forrest Gump in honor. I saw couple of Jhon Travolta and Samuel Jackson and talked for myself: What are idiots? Who they are? Nomination for Oscar... No! It's impossible!!! But it was reactions of little boy... I take for Pulp fiction first place in my personal rating now. See this movie...it's fantastic!"
2 August 2010,lorenzo-marconi,1,2,8,Black humor shines in dialogue-heavy pastiche,"A lot of people have heard about ""Pulp Fiction"", but what about it has made it so endlessly popular? The main attribute, I believe, is that there are few cinematic experiences like it. It is in the nether land between drama and comedy, and defies genre. Crime thriller? Not serious enough. Comedy? No, those are made solely for you to laugh. You want a comedy, get Steve Martin. After Travolta and Jackson exit that diner and the credits roll, you feel like you've seen something truly different. On top of the unique style, highly creative threads run non-chronologically through the movie, punctuated by irony. Examples? The diner thieves declare restaurants would be easy to rob, but are stopped dead by a religious hit man. A man has to take his boss's wife out, and if he so much touches her feet, he'll be killed. This turns to crisis when he almost kills her, which would be much worse. And finally, one hit-man admits that God intervened in his life and survives; the man who scoffed at this is killed. Those these stories may seem dry on paper, Tarantino peppers them with idiosyncratic moments: Gangsters dressed in t-shirts and bathing suits, a mysterious briefcase, and an escalating series of unfortunate events after returning from the bathroom. It's not perfect, however. The homosexual rape scene is in bad taste and does not have the artful spark the other stories do. This by itself knocked my rating down to an 8. Also, and this is an observation, not a criticism: the characters and plot are not as deep or involved as some other films. They have no purpose or weight. There is little change in characters that is delved into deeper than a conversation. Whether this is because the narrative only spans two days are because the ""epitome of cool"" style doesn't want emotional change is unknown. Overall, this is an interesting divergence from regular hero-villain-what have we learned cinema that combines clever story lines with cinematic homage."
5 July 2005,bryan_nixon79,0,1,10,Tarantino beats the competition to a bloody pulp,"I agree with many other citizens that Pulp Fiction is the best movie of the 1990s. It definitely ranks in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. What is so great about this movie is how Tarantino managed to steel from so many other films that he actually created something completely original. He also did this with Kill Bill. He deserved his Oscar for the screenplay. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction should have been awarded the Oscar for the best film of the year, but that honor went to Forrest Gump. It's a shame that Samuel L. Jackson was not awarded for his role as Jules. It is also a shame that Uma Thurman was nominated for her role in Pulp Fiction, but not for her performance in either Kill Bill. That's strange. Pulp Fiction is one of the funniest movies ever conceived. It is also one of the most intense. Of the three stories, The Gold Watch, which is about Bruce Willi's character, Butch, is my least favorite. But, it is far from being bad. To me, it plays homage to Deliverance, which is a great movie, too. I'm sure that's what Tarantino was going for. The third story, The Bonnie Situation, is a fast-paced slap in the face. Amazing! The first story, which is about Vincent Vega's, played by John Travolta, night with his boss's wife, played by Uma Thurman, on the town. It ends with one of the most heart-pounding scenes that I have ever viewed. I can't forget the Prologue and Epilogue, which takes place in a coffee shop. How brilliant is that scene? A restaurant being robbed. Keep up the good work Tarantino. I can't wait for his World War II film."
16 April 2006,ghost859,1,2,7,... It's entertaining,"There are few directors like QT out there, which I think is a tragedy. He makes films that are very, very clearly supposed to be pure entertainment, and artsy people attempt to find deep symbolism and meaning. The last sequence is really the only part of the movie that you can get any meaning from, other than the rather strange coincidences played out throughout the movie. Look, people, starting a movie at the end doesn't automatically make the movie an epic of intellectually gargantuan proportions. This is not a top 10 film. It barely scrapes into the top 25. That doesn't mean it's not a fun film, though. The dialogue and ridiculously coincidental twists make it a lot of fun to watch. Just watch it, enjoy the music and the dialogue, and walk away entertained."
18 January 2020,jwatcolts,2,10,6,Films have rules for a reason.,"It throws you in the back of a car and drives you around a neighborhood a few times so you can see what some random people are doing every 25 minutes. There is no purpose. There is no message. No plot. The is no profound emotional impact. No character development. It's exaggerated casual dialogue mixed with the f-word, some heroin and hitting a speed bump to accidentally shoot a guy. An innovative perspective of film-making? Absolutely. But a grand masterpiece ? Not by a long shot.Cinema has adopted the BASIC laws of film-making for a reason. We applaud movies that successfully intertwine the ability to hold a moviegoers attention while delivering a meaningful message. (Along with other simple stuff like plot, cohesion, purpose duh.)Fit to it's title, Pulp Fiction ignores this premise and takes the audience on sporadic fits of occasional tension and some odd but memorable dialogue. The superb acting and soundtrack do not justify an ultimately dull and meaningless movie that simply experiments with the laws of cinema."
19 May 2012,rebs_neto,1,2,9,Pulp Fiction - observations on human behavior,"When I had finished watching the movie I could ""heard the silence"" and at this moment on I enjoyed the silence. It is a special moment, isn't? Although I'm confused in my silence(there is chaos in my mind, wild chaos), it doesn't necessary mean that I've gotten lost in the story. No! Tarantino has a technique in exposing facts and put a special identity on them. Although, he doesn't offer us a linear story, in the end of it, we can perceive the connection between the facts. The fact is that there is a lot of ironic conversation and at some moment you start thinking whether it is witty or too wordy. What is the real meaning of the conversation? What he wants to achieve? What is the intention of redemption, loyalty, crime, treason? And to make things worse, there is outstanding performances, each actor performed incredibly well that stand out character and turn out human, it shows the character soul and at this point of my divagation I've found the special silence and I realize that less important thing on movie is why the characters act what they act. The important moment is watching they acting. There is not to be done, I've had a great time, however the Pandora's box has been opened and now, to complete this moment, I'm feeling moved to watch a Jodorowsky movie."

                        ",It's Been Said: Possibly the Coolest Movie Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction was the second Tarantino movie I've seen (the first being Reservior Dogs) and the first time I saw it, I thought Reservior Dogs was way better. But when I saw it again, I realized how great this movie was. Three ""Dogs"" have small roles in this film (Minor Spoiler: Harvey Keitel as The Wolf, Tim Roth as Ringo and Steve Buscemi (SP) has a cameo as a waiter).The film revolves around several the lives of several different people, and how their paths over a period of two days. Well-written dialogue and great acting make this movie a must-see. QT has done it again.PULP FICTION. Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Ving Rhames, Phil LaMarr, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Quentin Tarantino. ****/****"
19 January 2022,kitevar,0,0,10,15 of 10,"Well, first of all, I want to say that I just love this movie. I've watched it at least 30 times. I know almost every dialogue by heart and constantly quote my favorite phrases. And I also consider this picture not only the best in the work of the wonderful director Quentin Tarantino, but also one of the best in the history of cinema. Well, I was inspired to write this ""essay"" by the sincere bewilderment of some individuals - why does everyone love and extol ""Pulp Fiction"" so much? I can't answer for everyone, but I'll try for myself.So why do I love Pulp Fiction?First, for the script. The magnificent script, written by Tarantino together with Roger Avery, stands out from the rest with its originality and wit. As you know, Avery completely wrote the second short story ""Golden Watch"", everything else is the result of Quentin's creativity. Why is the script so good? Everyone! Wonderful dialogues that have long become cult - I think almost every movie fan knows the conversations of Vincent and Jules about foot massage or life in Europe. Excellent characters - scumbags quoting the Bible; a loser boxer ready to die for his father's watch; a failed drug addict actress who became the wife of a mobster. Unexpected and witty plot twists - divine intervention, a boxer meeting with a mafia, a shot in a car, etc. And finally, the game with chronology that has already become famous - the short stories are not in order, but mixed up in time. Brilliant script!"

                        ",OUTSTANDING TWO THUMBS UP MY FAVORITE FILM,"What can i say about this movie? Other then it being my favorite movie i can not begin to describe how much i like it. I am only 14 but i got everything about this movie. QT is a outstanding movie director, deff top 10 of the best directors in the world. WARNING SPOILERS: This movie revolves on different stories, all leading up to one big story in different orders, meaning that this movie isn't in order, but if you have a brain you will get it. A boat load of good actors, Sam Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhimes, John Travolta, Rosanna Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and even QT himself. Sam Jackson and John Travolta play two gangsters on their way to deliver a case of ? something? it is never explained to their boss Ving Rhimes. Bruce Willis plays a Boxer who disobeys Ving Rhimes orders and is on the run. Uma Thurman plays a Ving Rhimes wife. Rosanna Arquette plays a drug dealers wife. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth play husband and wife in the Restaurant Take-Over scene. This movie is noted for its extreme violence which deff takes its toll in this movie as many people are shot, a man is a raped, and car crashes, and a scene of OD. I will explain some of the my favorite stories. I like the Bonnie Situation in which John travolta shoots a gangmember in the face in his car on accident and Harvey Keitel comes to help them solve the problem. I also Like the Ving Rhimes and Bruce Willis stand off in rednecks store. I could go on and on but i cant, so just see this movie. I also want to comment on the music which is outstanding, and the direction, QT's long shots are very realistic."

30 September 2014,GanzEhrlich,0,0,10,Just watched it for the first time today,"I started university this week and when I wandered around the campus I saw a market-style DVD stall. I purchased two DVDs, one The Dark Knight (I am yet to see as of writing) and the other Pulp Fiction.And while I struggled to appreciate the movie when watching it, within a few hours I found that I enjoyed it and it was worth buying for repetitive viewing.Pulp Fiction is indeed one of the greatest movies ever (take that AFI's top 100!) for many a reason. Firstly, the dialogue. It is often irrelevant to the situation when it is spoken, but Quentin Tarantino covers a variety of interesting topics, so many in fact that I struggle to recall them all.Secondly, the way it is done is so captivating. Tarantino uses techniques found in films from many decades before. For example, when Vincent reads the note Mia left him, rather than a brief glimpse of it, we get to read it in detail, while Uma Thurman voices over what her character wrote. Also in scene transfers rather than a split-second cut, the screen gradually fades to black and then back to colour. It all adds style.Then of course there the iconic shots/images. Again there are too many to recall. How this movie won only 1 Oscar from 7 nominations is beyond me. At least it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.My only real problem was that the movie, which is about two-and-a- half hours long, felt slow in a few places, especially in the final scene in the diner but then again it must have been like that for a valid reason.The cast all did a superb job. None of the characters, maybe with the exception of John Travolta, appeared throughout the entirety of the movie. They had their stretches of time and all were memorable. Even writer and director Tarantino's Jimmie was impressive. Apart from the pawn shop characters, who are meant to be the nastiest (is what I said actually true?), I didn't dislike any of them, although everyone in Pulp Fiction, an intense crime movie, is meant to be bad, overaggressive or stupid in some significant way.I wondered if the money I spent on the Pulp Fiction DVD could have been better spent before I watched the film but now I regret NOTHING."
15 May 2006,pierrefonds_athlete101,0,1,10,Tarantino's best,"'Pulp Fiction' has very glamorous moments and its all timeless. Whenever I watch this film, I am interested with the way Tarantino organizes his time line, the way he made his characters, and his sense of conversation.What interests me even more is how he fitted Travolta back in stardom by using the same techniques from 'Saturday Night Fever' that organized Travolta into being a star. Travolta's character is like an older version of his ""Saturday Night Fever's"" Tony Manero. What upsets me behind this glamorous picture is why did Samuel L. Jackson not win the Oscar. He is very poetic and magnetic when it comes to his speeches from the bible.When Jackson and Travolta get into a conversation and debate on why they call a quarter pounder in the USA a quarter pounder and why they call a quarter pounder in France a royale with cheese, it gets me started on why would they have a conversation like this when they are about to kill some people? Jackson and Travolta have such a great morale that it makes 'Pulp Fiction' a question to the philosophy of life.The film is a little profane but you just got to understand that all the time you want a film to be real about the life of crime. When you see Travolta and Thurman or others doing drugs, the film seems deadly in a way. It's a kind of vibe that like makes you feel death is coming your way. Still just go see it and you will all have a great movie experience.10/10"
20 April 2021,dlb8685,1,3,7,I liked it a lot more when I was younger,"If you'd have asked me 15 years, this would be an easy 10/10.Something about it just hasn't aged that well for me. There's no denying the influence it has had on cinematic history. There's no denying that it is, all things considered, a very solid movie. I'm not trying to knock it when I give it a 7, that's a good rating for me.However... maybe it's that underneath all the quips, bullets, and one-liners, there's a message to the movie that has rubbed me more and more in the wrong direction over time. There's a moral message of redemption through faith (it doesn't matter if we witnessed an ""According to Hoyle"" miracle...), which is actually a very old-school Christian message hidden beneath everything, which for a non-believer like myself is kind of *shrugs.More so, it's in scenes like where the dealer says ""no trial, no jury, straight to execution"" right as Vincent prepares his smack. If you take it at face value, it sends a very anti-drug message (almost Duterte-level, actually). Yet as a whole this movie glorifies living life outside of the rules and the law, more than not.Maybe it's pedantic nitpicking to pick apart the deeper ""meaning"" like this. But finally, the dialogue and action just seems a bit too ""comic book"" for me as time passes. Maybe the movie really is a 10 and my tastes have changed, but I actually think the Jackie Brown/Max Cherry relationship was much more substantial filmmaking on Tarantino's part. Rewatching this movie after a long gap in time -- and it just wasn't the same for me as it used to be."
7 April 2010,Gotensive,0,2,5,Dull,"So I decided to re-watch this, as it's a film I've been told gets better on repeat viewings. I respectfully disagree. First off, for a film that's widely considered a brilliant piece of entertainment, I don't find it very much entertaining. It's too ""talky"", if that makes any sense. The scenes with Travolta and Jackson are good, particularly when Jackson is doing his yelling schtick, but some of the conversations just don't interest me. I don't care about what burgers are called in France, or whether or not they put Mayo on it. It's just filler, and dull filler at that.Which brings me to the Travolta scene with Uma Thurman, which is even more dull. We basically watch them on a date, chatting it up again with more useless filler ($5 milkshakes, foot massages, etc), and then we see them dance. Call me crazy, but I don't particularly find that entertaining. Now when Thurman over-doses, and what follows after, that's entertaining. But what happened on the date simply bored me.I'm also no fan of the Bruce Willis Segment, as his character is not interesting to me. For one, Willis pretty much plays himself, and two we have to watch him and his girlfriend talk about nonsense, like women with potbellies. I honestly don't understand why this is considered brilliant dialogue. The scene where Steve Buscemi talks about tipping in the superior ""Reservoir Dogs"" is far better written, and more interesting, than any of the dialogue in Pulp Fiction, IMO. Also, I don't buy Bruce Willis going back to save the gangster who was going to kill him.The movie does pick up when Travolta accident shoots the kid. I'll admit that part is funny, and very well written, even if Tarantino nearly ruins the whole scene with his voice and ""acting"". The ending in the restaurant is cool, as Jackson steals the show yet again. Overall though, I'm just not a fan of this movie. I have nothing against Tarantino, as I find ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the ""Kill Bill"" films to be solid and enjoyable films, but this film is, for the most part, dull. My 5/10 rating for it still stands."
28 January 2014,theminecraftassassin1234,0,1,10,Amazing Just Amazing,"The plot at times can be so WOW,like Samuel L. Jackson having a person at gunpoint and trying to start a conversation.Quentin Tarantino at times can be so amazing with this perfectly mastered hit.One of my favourites,it is amazing how using a strong amount of profanity,violence and drugs Quentin could be this number #4 on the IMDb Top 250.The story itself is a bit shallow but very unique in its on way I mean a boxer, a gangsters wife,two mob men and a couple of diner bandits in 4 epic tales of awesome violence that is unique man.Pulp Fiction is a must watch."
14 January 2019,lazarstrasni,1,2,9,Not so good,"I spent 2 and a half hours of watching this. I like violent crime movies like this one. I've heard that this is the best movie of 90s but i don't agree with that. This movie, compared to ""Godfather"" is 0/10.It has no logic and no sense, and ending is so stupid. Maybe actors are acting great, but in a wrong movie. I expected something more of Tarantino. Also the way character played by Bruce Willis kills Vincent is stupid."
22 May 2020,p-39630,0,0,8,a brief evaluation,"Deep meaning, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly into the dark and confused. Each paragraph has a complementary structure, with the beginning and the end linked together, suggesting that in reality, similar to what happens in movies, the plot is always happening and never stops.
I love the line: why do we have to keep talking crap to keep the mood going? Only when you find someone really special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
29 January 2011,acs0592,0,3,5,"Overrated and over-hyped constantly. In the end, Who Cares?","Everyone I talk too always makes these vague generalizations about this movie and how ""its so influential"" and ""its such a cool movie"", ""how it speaks to everyone"", and ""how everyone has to see it"". I must of missed the message. Nothing makes any sense at all. I don't like how Tarantino cuts the movie into different parts, it gets very annoying after a while. For the script, what a mess. I can handle profanity, but it's just one after another. And then theirs that weird scene in the pawn shop. Really? Who wants to see that in a movie? It is a shame the actors couldn't do better with the script they got. The plot (what little plot there is) is about John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson trying to deliver a case to Marsellus (Ving Rhames). Theirs a bunch of useless side-stories and dialog that no one cares about. The only upside is the ensemble cast, which is really diverse. Much like the extremely overrated Reservoir Dogs, who really cares about what happens and who dies? I only gave it a 5 because the cast is good."
15 July 2005,Kurt_Cocaine,0,1,10,Tarantino's greatest film to date!,"This film is more than merely a good motion picture, it's a pop-culture phenomenon.Everyone remembers the characters, played flawlessly by the horrifyingly diverse cast, props especially to Samuel L. Jackson humorous yet chillingly effective role as the jerry-curled, Psalm spewing Jules and Tarantino himself as the paranoid Jimmie(Who will always be remembered for the excellent line ""I don't need you to tell me how f**king good my coffee is, okay? I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping she buys SH*T. Me, I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it. But you know what's on my mind right now? It AIN'T the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead n***er in my garage"")Most importantly, the film's dialog will be forever over-quoted, it ranges from factual(""You see, this profession is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherf**kers. Motherf**kers who thought their ass would age like wine. If you mean it turns to vinegar, it does. If you mean it gets better with age, it don't"") To comical(""And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese? No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the f**k a Quarter Pounder is. Then what do they call it? They call it a Royale with cheese. A Royale with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac? Well, a Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it le Big-Mac. Le Big-Mac. Ha ha ha ha. What do they call a Whopper? I dunno, I didn't go into Burger King."") To the outright bizarre(""The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any of the slopes were gonna get their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you."") To the film's most famous line(""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."")The cinematography is spot-on, for the trademark trunk camera angle to the continuous take sequence, it's breathtaking to watch.The interconnected stories are well-written, but the pacing is a strain on the mind, if you want to watch this film without killing your own brain, get a hold of the Saudi Arabia or United Arab Emirates versions, the play the stories in order, thank God.But the one thing that will most likely confuse viewers the most is the contents of the briefcase, the answer will likely never be revealed, I'm sure Tarantino intended for there NOT to be answer.If you're looking to peer back into the tornado that is '90's pop-culture, give this a look, If you thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 is he best movie ever, watch this, it'll likely change your mind. Quinten Tarantino's Pulp Fiction receives a well-deserved ten blargs out of ten."
29 October 2017,nickyjohnp,0,1,7,"""Ah man, I shot Marvin in the face.""","Everybody know's this movie one way or another, with the famous dance scene between John Travolta as Vincent Vega and Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, to the minor cameo of Steve Buscemi as their waiter, Bruce Willis (Butch Coolidge) as the boxer who fight's the gimp and saves Ving Rhames as the crime boss Marsellus and a handful of other well-known actors. Samuel L. Jackson star's as the preacher hit-man partner of Vincent as Jules who has his own plan's for his future. But the one thing I love about this movie is it's not like any other Quentin Tarantino movie I've seen, this movie isn't in chronologically order as the beginning start's with the end, after that it goes to the beginning, than starts another story all these stories intertwine with each other. The dialogue for the movie is perfect for the actor's portraying the character's. The drug effect's for the movie all great you'll feel like your right there in the scenes when the character's indulge in drugs. Quentin Tarantino fits: crime, drama, thriller, action, and dark comedy. Yes that's right I said dark comedy, Mr. Tarantino pulled it all off, with a budget of $8,000,000. Quentin Tarantino makes a minor cameo as Jimmy as he help's Jules and Vincent with their situation. Harvey Keitel portray's the Wolff who's ""the guy who will fix your problem's no matter what it is"" I couldn't imagine another actor portraying this character than Keitel did. Roger Avary co-wrote the stories with Tarantino they had previously worked together on Reservoir Dogs, also Tarantino directed and wrote, with Keitel co- produced. With the love-hate running gag about what's in the briefcase and Tarantino's constant clues that imply what's in the briefcase. The movie will entertain you throughout as the comedy eases the unusual situations"
6 May 2017,inemjaso,0,0,10,The movie that got me into movies,"Well, its Pulp Fiction time and putting the revolutionary things this film did into ten lines is nearly impossible. A chronologically nonlinear plot edited to perfection, a cast of phenomenal actors with equally impressive chemistry, and a daring plot all drive Pulp Fiction towards the top of many people's list of all time greatest movies. The film opens with a conversation between a British couple at a diner who are planning a robbery which Tarantino does not bring the audience back to until the very end of the film. In between the robbery, intense character development occurs for a morally corrupt yet somehow likable group of gangsters, played by Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames. Rhames being the on screen presence he is plays the boss, with Travolta and Jackson operating as his soldiers and Willis operating as a boxer who receives under the table payments from Rhames for throwing fights. Among the excitement occurs a heap of trouble with a boxing match, a hit on an apartment gone wrong, and an overdose by Rhames' wife Mia, played by Tarantino's then girlfriend Uma Thurman. All of these unintended consequences create an overwhelming number of outrageous scenarios that test the resolve of this morally ambiguous bunch. Perfect writing, acting, directing, editing, and soundtrack make Pulp Fiction one of the objectively all time greatest films."
11 May 2017,gnc98,0,1,9,Solid Tarantino Classic,"Now it took me quite a while to finally see this film. I was first exposed to Quentin Tarantino's style with Inglourious Basterds, and ever since then I've been a fan of his work. That being said, it took me a full six years before I delved into one of his most critically acclaimed movies. I had read articles and reviews that said it was difficult to follow for most first time viewers, and that it typically required multiple viewings to wrap your head around the story. This made it seem intimidating, which may have subconsciously been what prevented me from watching it sooner. After finally seeing it though, I think I might have over-hyped that aspect too much. For me personally, I didn't think the film was too hard to follow. Yes, it isn't told in chronological order and the time changes aren't always immediately apparent, but I just think it's a smart film that respects the viewer's intelligence. I'm sure if I watched it again I'd notice other things I had missed or I'd understand the story better, but that can be said for any halfway decent film. This film is only different in that it displays the events and asks you to piece them together yourself. I think it's a brilliant way of tackling multiple interwoven stories, especially with such complex characters. I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said a thousand times before; the dialogue's well written, chemistry between characters is great, the visuals are stunning, editing is solid, the camera-work is topnotch, the story is interesting, and the whole thing is dripping with style. It's an awesome film and its story telling feels fresh, even thirteen years later."
22 November 2019,joeisboss,0,0,10,Best Ever,"This is easily my favorite movie. It has so much packed into it, so many twists and turns, and everything seems real, even the obscure things. It is hard to review this movie since there isn't anything bad to say about it. All I can say is watch it. I don't think you will be disappointed unless you're not into this kind of movie.
SPOILERS BELOWAnd Vincent Vegas death still has me shocked 3 days after the first watch. I fricking flipped when that happened."
27 May 2020,j-70786,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction,"I begin with a favorite film, Pulp Fiction. I love Cundin's work, especially Pulp Fiction. I don't know why, but it took me two weeks to get it back (I couldn't find it anywhere) . Look at the time and dormitory classmates and other dormitory several students look together, many people looked at about half an hour quietly left, some finished is more boring than not to see. After more than two hours of watching the movie, I lay in bed feeling like the movie itself, not knowing what I was thinking. It's just that Chuck Berry-You Never Can Tell keeps playing over and over in my head. I fell in love with the film two weeks later, at noon, when I felt an indescribable urge to see it again. The film consists of a prologue (a restaurant robbery) and four chapters (named ""Joos and Bunsei"" , ""Bunsei and Maschat's wife"" , ""a gold watch"" and ""Bunny's situation"") . It breaks the narrative structure of every movie I've ever seen, and that's without a doubt the greatest feature of the movie. Like a circle from a random point began to intercept, and finally returned to the starting point. In the story itself, my deepest feeling is not Cundin's violence and vice, but the film's realistic meaning, casual moment will let you feel the pressure of life. In real life, there are always too many heavy things, such as violence, sex, war on the whole human level, as well as on the individual level, such as making a living, settling down, relationships, and so on, we carry these heavy shells on our backs, it is a human tragedy to walk hard and be tired. Survival itself, from a certain point of view is a disaster, is irretrievable ""heavy"" , unless death... I do not know why such a film will give me such a thought. Perhaps it is too ordinary, ordinary people to see the ordinary level of the most real thing. Ummah. Thurman and John Johan. The Travolta dance is one of the most memorable parts of the film, it's just a normal part of the movie, and it's Cundin's way of entertaining the audience, but I remember it by accident, it's probably as hard for me to forget as living under pressure and having a little fun once in a while. A self-proclaimed ""vulgar"" story full of violence and black life, what meaning it brings to you is up to you to feel. In fact, I watch a movie in a different mood to see the same movie or in the same mood to see a different movie, out of the things are different, the mood will be like the plot slowly released. But I just love to watch movies, if anything to see that is their own little feelings, not a film review. Nor was there any critical review of, say, a clockwork orange, the meaning of which I still don't understand. I send all the emotions in the film, perhaps just to the past emotional life of a kind of escape. But I feel so relaxed. I saw Jiang Wen's The Sun Also Rises a while ago and loved the role of crazy mom. In fact, I think it's a relief to be crazy sometimes, it is better to live a life of madness than to live a life of worry and clarity. At least it's not a burden. In fact, I am now very disgusted with the people who write in the journal about their feelings, write their own emotional life colorful, dim light, you think you can write such a beautiful mood is great, but in my opinion than violence and vice is more vulgar. Because you never dare to use a realistic view of life and the treatment of emotions, you only dare to hide in the heart of the self and can not get the real sustenance, you are the real vulgar. At this point I'm starting to feel a little conflicted, maybe like Pulp Fiction, but most of all I just want to know what I want."

                        ",What's in the Suitcase,"Spoiler Alert Ever wondered whats in the suitcase? Here's my theory. It's Marcellus Wallaces Soul. Here's how it came to me, first of all, on an unrelated note, I once heard that anyone who sees a soul dies soon after. Now regarding the movie, we never see whats in the briefcase, but it shines so it could be gold, but I reckon someone would have pointed it out and said, ""wow, that gold is amazing!"" Marcellus Wallace has a plaster or bandaid on the back of his neck through out the film and he wants the contents of the briefcase quite badly. Now, to prove my point, the following saw the contents of the briefcase and died: Vincent Vega and all the guys that him and Jules took it from on their 'errand'. Tim Roths character also saw it, BUT!.. his soul was bought off of him by Jules in the restaurant for $1500; ""go on take it, but I'm buying something with that money. You know what I'm buying, your soul"". Jules himself took the Kung Fu-esque wiseman route to do good, so Tim Roths character gets to live... as for Jules himself, he never actually looked into it..."
6 January 2006,Wogle,0,1,10,"A special FIlm, or just over-rated?","In truth a lot of people might watch Pulp Fiction and wonder what the fuss is all about. At its core, it is a violent, blood-filled film with characters from a side of society that many of the viewers wold probably not get involved in, and most of whom take drugs. On this level, it is not even a good film.However, what makes Pulp Fiction so good, is its crude humour, use of the social stigmas, and non-linear, multi-strand narrative.If you think about it, very few films are willing to ""glamourize"" hit men, drugs, gimps, and violence. Pulp Fiction uses each so many different taboos to mock society, and people in general, that you can't help but admire the script writing and the directing that has gone into the film.Pulp Fiction means something written poorly. There's you first start for comedy - The film is one of the best written to date."
14 December 2016,nplumley518,0,0,9,Pulp Fiction Review,"I have heard so much about this movie, but I never gave it a chance. I am now glad I did. Pulp Fiction starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L Jackson goes into the twisted lives of hit men, boxers, and gangsters. Overall, i felt that the film was put together very well. One of my favorite scenes is Mia OD's and she has to get stabbed with an adrenaline shot to the heart by Vincent. I felt the cinematographer did an amazing job of giving the whole scene a nervous feel considering Vincent has never done this before and its matter of life and death. The jump cuts, close ups, and silence really built the suspense. Overall, I felt that the plot was a little all over the place and I couldn't really find the meaning of the work. But all the stories in this film were done very well. Overall incredible film."

                        ",Most Quotable Movie of All Time?,The average person can quote the most infamous lines from this film as it has become a cult classic. Taking a film class illuminated to me that the editing technique gave an altered sense of a timeline presents a significant twist at the end of the film. The character dialogue was superb and Samuel L Jacksons round character arc was a real treat to watch. I was impressed with everything from the low angle camera shots that Tarantino focused implemented and the trippy feel to the film. Truly Unforgettable!
9 December 2018,Victoria0708,0,1,9,Very well done,"This film was incredibly confusing at first. There was a lot of hopping around to the different plots and was sometimes difficult to keep up with. I felt as if you couldn't turn your head for a moment because you might miss something important. It was a very creative put together film and it worked in the end. It had this sense of flow that you had to get used to, but once it all clicked into place, I understood who was who, what story plot was which and how they fit. This film also had a sense of realism in it. The actors who played the diner bandits, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, did it very well and they looked like what I thought lover bandits would, a bit crazy.The hitmen were well played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. I love the smoothness in their conversations, but they played the personality of mob hit men and their names fit as well, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield. It just all matched up. Then Bruce Willis played a good boxer and lived up to the character I expected, Butch Coolidge. Although it wasn't my style of movie that I normally watch it was a well directed film and Quentin Tarantino did a great job. Definitely recommend watching at least once in your life time."
31 July 2019,smittenkittens,1,11,3,So overrated,"Honestly, I don't get it. I have no idea what the point of this movie is! There are 3 different storylines told out of order, which had me SO confused as one character dies and then is in a few more scenes later on. Bruce Willis's wife in the movie is like EXTRA annoying and they have a creepy sex scene. Lastly, there's an anal rape scene where Ving Rhames is the victim, which I thought was just unnecessary. The scene could have been just as effective if he was only tortured, but of course Quentin Tarantino is so messed up in his head and always has to take stuff to the next level of gross and weird, hence we have a rape scene.In my opinion, he probably should have sat on this script a few years longer like he did with Inglourious Basterds to make it better."
27 October 2005,tarantino_fan99,4,8,10,The Best Film Ever Made,"Holy Crap was I blow away by this movie. The First Time Iwas introduced to Tarantino was when I saw Reservoir Dogs (1992) a few years ago, I thought it was terrific (other than at times it could get boring) I thought nobody could possibly make a better crime movie than this, boy was I wrong. Months later I rented Pulp Fiction on DVD, ""Holy Crap"" I thought to myself ""this is freaKIin good."" Moments like when Jules and Vince are talking about fast food joints in Amsterdam and if a foot massage is sexual or not are very interesting if not gut bustingly hilarious, and the dialogue is so good u would swear u were actually listening to an actual taped conversation between 2 real people. And what can I say about the action, while not a lot (compared to other movies) the action is so awesome to watch, like when Marcellus is going across the street and he and Butch's eyes meet and Butch hits him with the car, terrific. If you have a small video collection definitely make this one of it. You won't regret it."
2 September 2020,disposableemail-49800,5,16,1,There's something wrong with society,"It's almost 25 years now since i saw that movie for the first time. I watched it during school trip with my class and i still remember the shock turning to rage when i heard my not-friends-anymore cheering and applauding violence shown on screen.Most of the film critics say that the violence shown in Tarantino movies is a parody of real violence. I do not think so. Most of his movies feature at least one scene where we see helpless, crying victim begging for life mocked by omnipotent, cruel kiler.Let's take the execution scene in the beginning of the movie as an example. Everyone (and i mean EVERYONE) i talked to admitted that he/she was laughing, because the things Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is saying are funny. But all i can see is Brett, who is almost crying as Jules shouting his lines at him. He knows he is about to die and all he can hope for is to die quick. It's horrific. I can almost sense his fear. But the audience is laughing. Even the sensitive people.You see - i know violence. I experienced violence in my life. And that's how it looks in real life. Begging victim and the triumphant torturer. And there's usually someone standing by and laughing too. I bet Tarantino knows this as well - that's why it's directed this way.That's why the movie is revolting. Not funny at all. It's sick.And then i learned that this movie won Oscar and Tarantino is highly esteemed as a ""genius director"". I could not believe it. I am surrounded by people who laugh when see people killed, mutilated, and humiliated. And they are buying each cheap excuse Tarantino comes up with to justify another scene of cruelty (Jews avenging holocaust, slave is killing cruel plantation owner, someone should give the Manson family what they deserved). I am not buying it. I see what you are, Quentin. You are one sick, perverted psycho who likes to show cruelty on screen.And by the way - it's not true that you have to be ""braindead American"" to praise this movie. It has a cult following all over the world.For years i thought i was alone. But today i just read some of the 1-star reviews for this movie and i feel uplifted somehow. I am not the only one. Maybe there's hope for humanity after all. All these people saying that the violence is no laughing matter - THANK YOU. You worked better than three years of therapy. :)"
3 May 2016,Dezcaughtit88,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction Review,"Words cannot describe the cleverness and artistry that is this film. Unconventional story telling, superb acting with in depth characters, over the top violence, and iconic interactions make this film a classic. The choppiness and disorder of the story can come off as confusing but once you begin to patch the scenes together you begin to truly understand the story. The dialogue is amazing, each interaction is beautifully written and acted and is also extremely thought provoking. While the movie is violent in nature their are many themes of religion and good vs. evil that make the story even more captivating. The clever use of close ups makes the characters more interesting and the dialogue more powerful. The acting by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman is all award worthy and elevates it from a movie to an experience. This is one of the most unique and artistic films ever created and each component from the camera work to the sounds and actions is beautifully executed."
1 September 2007,pulpmaster2517,1,3,10,One of the few perfect movies ever made.,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that comes along every once and a while that just shocks everybody because people sometimes can't explain the reason the film is so good. It is a landmark film in terms of style, screenplay, and story structure. In the beginning scene in the film we see two seeming normal people who are talking so calmly about robbing banks, drug stores, coffee shops etc...this is one of the best cold openings ever conceived on film. It opens up on a beautiful long shot and you just assume 'Oh here are our films stars' and you don't know any better for the first few minutes because the dialog is so detailed that this must have to tie in with the story it must. At first you are confused you're simply like 'What is going on' this is a pretty random conversation. But as it escalates you start to understand a bit more. When they start talking about how easy it would be to rob a coffee shop and the reasons it is so simple you stop and think to yourself 'Wow they are so right' and as the scene progresses you get drawn in more and more and by the end of the scene you're just hooked and wants to see what will happen next. Then after the opening credits we see John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson and you're just like 'What where did the other people go' but soon you get so wrapped in the dialog of these two hit men about such random amusing things that you forget about that and get wrapped in the conversation of these two guys with some of the best dialog ever written. After we see them discussing gossip about Tony Rocky Horror and Mrs Mia Wallace and it it is so amusing to listen to this conversation despite the explicitly of the dialog. You listen to them gossip and argue and you know you've had a similar conversation as this sometime in your life and you are easily wrapped up in the story even more. Once they go in to the apartment you see exactly how these guys work and you're thinking 'Are these really the same guys that they were two minute ago?' Then you hear Jules' Ezekiel 25:17 in the context which is going on which is just brilliant followed by the gold light when they shoot and kill their victim. Now lets jump ahead to the date with Vince and Mia and once again we see some great dialog which is just your everyday chit chat, everyday date. With the exception of some cocaine snorting in the bathroom. I think that this scene is the one John Travolta is best in because you can just tell exactly how high he is and how good he feels. After Mia ODs we are once again just amused by the arguing Vince and Lance are having despite the fact that a woman is dying right in there bedroom. This is one of the most dramatic, adrenaline rushing scenes in the movie as well as one of the funniest. Lets now jump ahead to Butch's story where we get great dialog in the cab driver who is simply curious about Butch and in the hotel room with some everyday boyfriend girlfriend love talk and goofing around. When Butch goes to get his watch he kills Vincent coming out of the bathroom and runs into Marcellus on the way home and from there the adventure continues with the rapist storyline. And the incredible use of music when Butch gets his katana and saves Marcellus. Now we find ourselves back in the room from the beginning of the film with Vince and Jules and we see them killing Brett from a different point of view followed by tons of humor between the Divine Intervention and Marvin's head. We get more great dialog for the remainder of this section and then we end up back in the diner from the beginning and all starts to make sense. Then in the dramatic conclusion Jules gives one of the greatest speeches ever on film and we finally understand the message of the film, redemption. Everyone with the exception of Vincent has been given a second chance. Mia, Marcellus, Butch, Jules, Pumpkin and Hunny Bunny. Now looking back on Vincent we notice that he ignored the divine intervention and thought Jules was crazy, therefore being stupid and ignoring his chance for redemption then each time he goes to the bathroom something bad happens: He comes out in the restaurant and there are robbers, he goes to the bathroom at Mia's he comes out she ODs and he comes out of the bathroom at Butch's and Vincents life comes to an end. Pulp Fiction is so simple and yet at the same time one of the most complex films ever made that is open to so much interpretation I don't think we will ever catch every little thing in the film. Between the pop-culture references, the unbelievable dialog we can all relate to, the simple yet complex story lines, the complex story structure that finally starts to come together piece by piece near the end. And the films overall message of redemption. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest achievements in motion picture history and will be a timeless classic for generations and generations."
27 July 2008,annamercy,2,8,5,empty masterpiece,"pulp fiction *** This comment may contain spoilers *** The opening scene is the best part of the film using a book device to get the audiences attention. Then follows a broken narrative. And this film needs a broken narrative device to hold th e attention because the film is a mess.The trick Tarantino has used to hold th e audience is endless ""what's going on"" whether its Tim Roth and what does he see in the suitcase or th away it jumps between stories and going backwards and forwards.The script. Its nothing more than overly stylised dialogue and the characters are one dimensional and flat. Every scene of dialogue is wrung out until its dead, and then give it another kick. The emptiness of the movie shows that Tarrantino did spent his while time watching videos and then aped what he saw, instead of learning how to write scripts and compose scenes. Its been getting more apparent in more recent films."

                        ",An all time masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino is absolutely fabulous! His directing is so realistic that he is able to make even a fantasy movie look so real. PULP FICTION is not an exception from the rule.The most delicious part of this masterpiece is not the action, but the memorable dialogs. You'll never forget the lines of JULES (Samuel L. Jackson) including the Ezekiel 25:17 quote, the DEAD N. STORAGE joke (Quentin Tarantino), or the intelligent lines of MIA (Uma Thurman).The interesting issue about this movie is that, like in all the other Taranantino movies, the action is unpredictable. I'm sure nobody expected that VINCENT (John Travolta) would be killed, specially because he was the main wiseguy besides JULES. Also the case for MARSELLUS (Ving Rhames), the boss who got raped.Because of these you'll have your breath taken away for the whole 2 1/2 hours of the movie, and when you'll see the closing credits you'll be very disappointed that it's over.Definitely 10 out of 10 for the directing and the acting."
19 January 2020,anthonymigliori,0,0,10,A landmark film for both Tarantino and the indie film world.,"Quentin Tarantino, from the very beginning, was known in the indie film world for his previous debut, Reservoir Dogs. However, it wasn't until Pulp Fiction that the writer-director cemented himself as a talent to be reckoned with.The screenplay, if you think about it, is kind of a game-changing one and it all comes from Tarantino's love of reading novels. The non-linear structure, at first, messes with your head. Through patience and a couple of rewatches, however, don't worry. You'll understand the whole story structure then.The performances are also brilliant. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson shine alongside Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, and the rest of the cast. Considering that this is the film that put Travolta back on the map, it's safe to say he's more then awesome in this film.Overall, this film, a brilliantly written, amazingly acted, and unique genre blend is truly worth watching and is truly worth the praise and accolades it has received."
1 March 2016,hcib,0,0,10,Great movie,"One of the best movies i've ever seen! This is an absolute classic. Nobody should miss out on it. If you haven't seen it yet, go for it and watch it today! The movie starts by showing a couple in a restaurant. They decide to rob the restaurant because it is simpler than robbing gas stations or random shops. Afterwards, the action moves to two killers, one of whom has just returned from Amsterdam. They are on their way to kill a couple of small time gangsters that tried to cheat on the killers' boss - Marcellus Wallace. They discuss the metric system and how different European coulture is in comparison to the American one. They interrogate the gangsters and kill them one by one, eating their breakfast at the same time."
8 August 2001,LtCol_Kilgore,0,1,9,"Why Jackson, travolta, and willis are cold-blooded, and redemption","SPOILERS***** For all you people who whine about Willis, Jackson, and Travolta's cold-blooded killings, it is relevant to redemption, only a major theme of the movie. Maybe you were too ignorant and dumb to realize that all of Jackson's violence and killings and near death caught up with him in the diner, resulting in powerfully salvating speech. He finally realized the meaning of the Bible verse and how he had been violating it. So he quit his ways and tried to help and shepard the two robbers, redeeming himself from the bloodshed he had caused previously. Ignorant people: that is one of the obvious, major themes of ""Pulp Fiction.""That moral is :Even among the lowest, most vile low-lives, redemption and honor can be attained, resulting in peace, success, etc. Travolta's character refused to follow Jackson's move, and Travolta ended up riddled with bullets. THe other theme is this world is a crazy, bad place. The two morals connect because, even in this dark hell, you can still redeem yourself no matter how bad you are. you must be brave and shepard the weak and evil to salvation ****/**** ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the 90's."
27 July 2009,bryan_mcdade,1,2,10,pure perfection,"where do you start when praising Tarantino and pulp fiction, the top class performances he always seems to get from the actors, the always sharp and witty dialogue, or the fact that he feels is lazy to use real brands and comes up with his own for his films, like big kahoona burger or red apple cigarettes. the acting in pulp fiction ranges from really good to excellent. john travolta, samuel l jackson, uma thurman, Bruce Willis and Harvey kietel being the latter. the scene with travolta and jackson discussing McDonald's in Europe is pure class, the dialogue is as we would except from Tarantino and considering the conversation has no relation to the plot of the movie it is one of the most realistic because unlike other movies, tarantinos have people doing what they do in real life..sitting around having conversations about any old s**t. overall pulp fiction is a fast paced action,crime,violent,black comedy movie that delivers on every level, whether you're a serious movie buff or a casual watcher pulp fiction will leave you astonished. and going over in your mind countless times whats in that suitcase....ahhhhhh!"
8 July 2007,JetBanana,0,2,10,Film is an Art,"I am mainly dedicating this comment to the millions of closed-minded ""film fanatics"" who think the only way a movie can be ""good"" is if it has a distinct plot and plot outline characterized through pages of unnecessary dialouge. I found Pulp Fiction to be the perfect film to use as an example of all of the points i wish to make.A movie is much like any other piece of art, whether it is a sculpture, painting, etc. You need to open your mind and let it speak to you through your own interpretation. I've been told by some people that Pulp Fiction has no story line and is completely meaningless. It isn't going to be spoon fed to you. God forbid you have to think a little when you watch a film and you have to form some of your own conclusions.For those who watched this movie and didn't find it to have meaning, let ME spoon feed it to you. Pulp Fiction explores four major themes and does so through the use of multiple, sometimes inter-weaving, stories. The main themes are Friendship, Loyalty, Love (specifically forbidden love), and Revelation. Friendship is characterized through the words AND ACTIONS (not ALL dialouge like you'd like it to be) of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). They play two partners in a crime syndicate and through certain events throughout their story, their friendship grows to new levels. Their constant bickering and arguing through the film shows their getting to know one another better and look at life through a different perspective.Loyalty is portrayed through Butch's (Bruce Willace) story. He has the most open ended story of them all because it really make you wonder what happens next, but you are forced to use your imagination. His character is given a business proposition which he takes into his own hands and slightly foreshadows his ability to possibly form his own crime syndicate (but by the independancy of his character this seems unlikely).Forbidden Love is the meaning behind Vincent and Mia's (Uma Thurman) tale. I've heard from many that this was the most pointless story of them all and i wish to have you rethink that. She is the wife of a crime boss, and he works for this boss. The thought of their love for one another was so unthinkable in their situation that it had to be expressed through actions (hence the word ACTING). A prime example was the cinematically infamous ""twist"" scene. It showed the parallel rhythm of their ""souls"" for the lack of a better word and portrayed their completion of one another.And finally, Revelation. The closing point of the film. It starts with the life-altering event (for Jules at least) of not being hit by a single bullet shot at him. Even at that one moment he almost immediately rethinks his whole outlook on life and decides to retire. But this is only the beginning. The most powerful scene in the film is in the diner at the end. Jewels spreads his message of life and appreciation to two small time crooks who decide to rob the diner and its customers. Through a very deep and proactive monologue delivered by Samuel L. Jackson, the robber only known as Pumpkin (Tim Roth) is left speechless and in awe as he walked away with his wife and went home, hopefully to start an new life.I hope this helped you further appreciate this cinematic masterpiece and also help you realize the importance of watching movies, or any art form, with an open mind and with imagination. Do not always dismiss something you don't understand as meaningless, in everyday life as well, for that is the ignorance this world decays from everyday."
19 October 2007,claytonators,0,1,6,Very Good but ...,"I didn't get what all the fuss was about really. Well it wasn't a bad film it was a very good film, the acting for one thing was brilliant, especially by Samuel L. Jackson, the Diolauge was at its best for another thing, but the only problem was that it was really slow in parts like the JACKS RABBIT SLIM or whatever you call it. Before John Travolta and Uma Thurman start dancing their talking about foot massages and some other things while doing nothing but sitting down in a 50's restaurant. Now like i said, the Diolauge is very good and its really funny but while their doing nothing the film can get boring. Another thing like that was the ending, the big Mexican duel in the restaurant. Sam Jackson has a gun to Tim Roth's head, Amanda Plummer is pointing a gun to Jackson and John Travolta is pointing a gun to Amanda. All that is happening for about ten, fifteen minutes and nothing proper happens. Sam Jackson is telling Roth about a miracle he witnessed this morning, and then he gives Roth his money and then he lets him go, and its like oh come on get on with it all ready. As for the really good parts there was the hamburger scene, OK now that was slow but not boring like some of the others, there was the dance scene, the overdose scene was the only part in the film where i was on the edge of my seat, then their was the pawn shop scene which was really funny and shocking. And finally there was the 'The Bonnie Situation' which was boring and good.Not long after i watched the film, my friend asked me to borrow it and i said OK. A day later he gave it back and said it was crap. I can see why people could hate this film, apart from the racial stuff, and i can see why people love this film but as for me, i give it a 7 out 10 for being and not being good. I recommend Reservoir Dogs instead. 7/10 OK."

Pulp Fiction is absolutely the best movie of the 90`s. This is my honest opinion. It is also one of the greatest movies of all time. And the best thing about it is that you can watch it as many times as you like and never get bored! Maybe I´m praising it too much, but I can´t help it. ""Kill Bill"" was also a Very Fine Film, but this tops even that. There isn´t many other movies with this much of phrases to remember. I cant say I have seen any movie with dialogue like this! No surprise. I give full 10/10"
11 January 2011,b-pradheep,1,2,9,Pulp Fiction,"Can this movie be said a brilliance of Tarantino or an extra- ordinary characterization package. Oops, it has both.Phenomenal screenplay for a movie that has nothing. Thats Tarantino's excellence for you on screen.John Travolta and Samuel. L. Jackson make a good white and black hit men combination. Not like a typical black American who makes an awkward dialog delivery showing that he is ferocious, actually it makes us sleep.The drugs portrayed in the movie makes us ask ourselves whether America has gone this much mad??MIA-Oh what a pleasure to watch her perform full credit to Uma Thurman for her flawless performance. Oh.Am sorry European girls are good in showing what they actually are.The only thing that breaks a youngster's heart is that Mr.Ving Rhames (Marsellus Wallace) owns Mia. Other than that he is a perfect gangster. Peter Greene (Zed) fits perfect that you guess him to be homo sexual the 1st time you see him in the movie.Quentin Tarantino (Jimmy) is good in acting but not too good as he does his direction.Background scores take the film to another to another level in which Tarantino is a pro in selecting tracks that he wants.Bruce Willis(Butch) can be believed a boxer but not a swordsman.Harvey Keitel (The Wolf) makes a murder hiding into a professional egg spillage cleaning and could've been used more for the movie.Maria De Medeiros (Fabienne) does nothing other than crying and kissing Mr.Butch . A real fact is that girls are the best in this.Tim Roth (Pumpkin) and Amanda Plummer (Honey-Bunny) looks to be porn stars than thieves as they do their kissing more intense than the robbery.Yet another Tarantino's master piece with his unique screenplay which fetched him an Oscar for that. The film has phenomenal music absorption making it to be his best ever till date.If u find out the 1st and the last event in the movie watching the 1st time, there is no doubt that you are a crazy mad-man on movies and Tarantino."

11 May 2014,lindamillerpt,1,2,10,"The most unique movie I have ever seen, and also one of the best.","Pulp Fiction. Where do I even begin to review a film like Pulp Fiction. Let me just start out by saying that I have never seen another film like Pulp Fiction. This was my first Quentin Tarantino film, and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece. One of the greatest things about this film, and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie, is that it revolves around the dialogue. The conversations between characters in Pulp Fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that I have ever seen in a film, because they are absurdly realistic. This film is the most quotable movie I have ever seen, to the point where the last scene of the film I know almost every line. Usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue, it ends up being really boring. This is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that Quentin Tarantino does dialogue.The acting in this movie is also incredible. This is my favorite role that Samuel L. Jackson has played (Jules Winnfield) and also my favorite role of John Travolta's (Vincent Vega), as well as my favorite role of Uma Thurman (Mia Wallace) and Tim Roth (Ringo). There is not one weak performance in Pulp Fiction. Tarantino's non-linear, non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that I have ever seen. It is entirely left up to your own interpretation. Nothing in this film is explained for you. You are free to think of it however you want, and make up your own stories. Once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as ""What is in the briefcase,"" one of the longest standing questions asked of a film. People try to come up with the answer, but the truth is that there is no answer. The answer is whatever you want it to be. Never before have I seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewer's interpretation, and does it so well. If you do not see this movie, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see. This Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece by far.Pulp Fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10."
13 January 2017,ebhae-34976,0,0,10,The best movie of the best movie year,"1994 is the best movie year ever, I even think that is a fact.My top 10 in no particular order.The Shawshank redemption.Forest Gump. The lion king.León the professional.Speed.Natural born killers.Ed wood.dumb and dumber.True lies.and of course this one. So what make this movie the best (in my opinion). 1: DialogueThe dialogue in this movie is not plot driven. The purpose with the dialogue is to set up the characters and entertain the audience, that it succeed with. The dialogue is also what makes this movie so funny. Tarantino (the director) like to use phrases that means the same thing as more common use phrases but is so much funnier. 2: ActingAmazing dialogue without a good delivery is nothing and a great script without characters you like is not nearly as entertaining. Luckily for this movie the acting is great and they deliver the dialogue perfect (Especially Samuel L Jackson). For example Vincents reaction when Mia came back home from the heroine overdose, that is some serious acting. And don't forget this movie brought John Travolta back to life.3: SoundtrackEvery scene(Except maybe the Vincent talking with Butch scene) that could have been kind of boring Tarantino filled with music that pretty much everyone can enjoy, the driving montage, sun of a preacher man, girl you'll be a woman soon and the dance scene. But the music also is important to set the tone and ad to the fantastic experience that is Pulp Fiction. 4: CinematographyLike the soundtrack the cinematography is just Pulp Fiction. The bright colors and the typical stile Tarantino have when he shot movies. The camera told us that this is a fun experience, not a dark movie.5: The scriptThis might be the best script of all time execute to perfection. It's in the script all the joke is and it is the script that have the perfect linked story. But the script also have the three different time-lines that makes this movie one of the most re-watchable movie of all time.This is my favorite Tarantino movie and my 3d/2nd favorite movie of all time."
31 August 2013,tashurovs,1,2,10,First of it's Kind.,"An excellent move, unique in any way, a lot of laughs, violets, black- The humor and the very twisted adventure you will ever see, the music Inside? It's the last one you will ever like. Never before Quentin makes so much surprises in one movie. There will be lots of conversation lot of confusion and a lot of explanation. The lot of you have already watched this movie but I will not talk about so much so you can replay it or if you have missed this masterpiece of Tarantino go on. It's your lucky day. You can actually learn how to dance in a legendary 1970's way where the main roles you will about to see it will stunt you forever."
9 February 2007,chriscc-3,0,1,10,The Greatest Movie/Film Ever Made,"What's the difference between a movie and a film? A movie is purely raw entertainment, simply there to make the viewer laugh, scream, cry, or get pumped up. A film does not only this, but makes the viewer think or gain a deeper understanding of the themes in the film.Pulp Fiction is both the greatest film and movie ever made.The acting is perfect (Most actors were relatively unknown at the time, with the exceptions of Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken.) The cinematography is everything you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, one of the most genius directors in history. This is the movie that all 90's gangster flicks wished they could be, and never will be.The three story lines intersect perfectly. Without question.Those are the film aspects, now for the movie ones: Right at the beginning, you know this movie's gonna get your blood flowing with the opening lines: ""Everybody be calm, this is a robbery!"" ""Any of you f***ing b****es move, i'll execute every one of you motherf****rs!"" Then it goes straight to the opening credits, perfectly pulled off with the amazing song Misirlou.And of course there's Jules' Bible passage before he kills Brent. Too awesome.The greatest movie/film ever. Period."

                        ",I cant believe someone thinks its a film about nothing,"I was just browsing through the internet and i ended up here, reading the user reviews for pulp fiction, as you do.Then i came across a comment saying that this film is about nothing...if the person had paid attention, they'd have noted that, in fact, there are several stories going on all at once. Each major charachter has a significant portion of the limelight to get quite a detailed story behind them, even the sub characters have a story, *spoiler* such as the bar tender who we later see is now working with Vincent as jules' replacement, the two of them are in search of a boxer who has ripped off their boss but goes on to save him later, after the boxer has killed vincent, but vincent had earlier witnessed what jules (his old partner) saw as a miracle but chose to ignore it.This is by no means anywhere near the entire plot of this movie, and we already have more plot than the first two installments of lotr. To complicate and add even more suspense in not knowing whats happening and removing any chance of predictability in the long term, the film is cut up and rearranged with bits overlapping imperfectly to show different perceptions of an event."
1 May 2013,angusward1,1,2,10,Tarantino in his element,"Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' is the most stylish film ever made. The title and front cover says it all; 'Pulp Fiction'. It's pertaining to old comic book strips usually containing lurid subject matter with a modern day twist. The film conveys this perfectly through the eyes of characters: Vince, Jules and Butch played by Travolta, Jackson and Willis. The non-linear time sequence also allows the audience to become more submerged in the multilateral plot, by understanding how each character's actions eventually effect anthers, causing the plot to intertwine narratives. The cool 1950's - 1970's rock n' roll music also saturates the film in a cool and eccentric atmosphere which is then juxtaposed with gratuitous violence, sexual violence and drug themes. This feeling is perfectly described by one scene of Travolta's character Vincent, driving a cherry red convertible cadillac down a road at high speed with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) overdosing on heroin in the back seat. This is how the film makes you feel when it reaches its climax. On the other hand, the relief comes with witty dialogue and great humour which makes you think about pop culture and society. The whole film is an absolute ride and my favourite of all time."

But most of all I remember my favorite character Vincent Vega. The character doesn't seem to have anything in him that you can openly sympathize with. Unlike the heroes of Andrew Beckett, Forrest Gump, Marty McFly, Dr. Emmett Brown, this character can in no way be considered good. But can it be considered bad. Is this a question for the viewer?"

It's too good, it'a too real, all characters are real, the script is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I admire Quentin Tarantino's movies. All of them are amazing, but these one, beats the other ones, for sure. My favorite part is the first part of the movie: Vincent Vega and Marcellu's wife. The date part is amazing. Uma Thurman, I don't know, her character is incredible, and with John Travolta they make a wonderful couple (on the screen). Just... just watch this movie that I think you're gonna like it. This are 2:30 of high Hollywood quality. There are no words for this masterpiece. It should reach 100 stars. It deserves it. It should won all the Oscars that was nominee for."

24 June 2004,mafernandez,0,1,10,The Briefcase -SPOILER-,"This film begins with the end and ends at the beginning. With many different peoples lives coming together all at once. The most amazing interpretation with which I agree is that of the contents of Marcelas Wallace's brief case. The opening scene of Marcelas Wallace is of the back of his head which has a band-aid, well when the devil takes ones soul he takes it through the back of one's head. Now, if this is true then the contents of the briefcase which when ever opened glows with a bright gold light, Is really Marcelas Wallace's soul.

9 May 2009,Mytharic,1,2,9,Near-Profound Insanity,":SPOILERS: I don't think there's much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. I guiltily enjoyed the dark humor and disturbing hilarity, which was executed perfectly by Jackson, Willis, and Thuman. I found Travolta's character a little too slick and confident to be believed; his attitude reminded me of similar characters Travolta has played in the past, making it more difficult for me to separate the actor from the character.The script, as I expected given that it was written by Quentin Tarantino, was full of gory violence and random tangents, the latter of which were both educational and entertaining. The non-linear narration was fun, though it didn't seem to serve much of a purpose other than to give greater weight to Vincent's decision to continue working for Marcellus and Jules' decision to turn away. Jules' decision, and his final monologue, elevates the film, for me, above a crazy thrill-ride. Before the final scene, the film presents characters who are funny, but nevertheless repugnant in their self-centerdness. Jules' ability to step outside himself and see his own hypocrisy and selfishness allows him to place the exaggerated travails of the film in within a moral context -- a moral context which does not diminish the hilarious insanity of the film, but reminds the viewer that a more fulfilling life does exist beyond that insanity"

19 January 2022,nastasevasil,0,0,10,Everyone is equal,"I understood the meaning of the narrative only in the middle, the story arc of all the characters is quite interesting to observe, I watched without taking my eyes off, as they say. The beginning is connected with the end in order to show the whole essence of the existence of decisions and their consequences. That all the people around are connected, that life is chaotic and unpredictable. This film painfully shows all the comicality of life, even those people who are beyond understanding (their actions are very different from ordinary people). He draws a thin thread between all people, showing the similarity of destinies, that even different people have the SAME problems. Be you the Boss, be you the sycophant. Everyone is at a crossroads of fate."
2 July 2005,seanwn14,0,1,10,"One of the best films ever made, better watch","Again, what can I say that hasn't been said about this damn near perfect movie. Quentin Tarantino is brilliant with his other movies like Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bills. But with Pulp Fiction, there is something way more than great. He tells three stories and each seems better than the last one. There not in order but I don't think it is easy to get lost because it's a great movie. Jules and Vincent have to be the best characters in the whole film and I think the only people you can hate are Zed and the shop owner. The ""Gimp"" maybe, but he's just creepy. Samuel Jackson is so bad-ass with his whole Ezkiel 25:17 speech, but even the lines with him eating and drinking the guys food were some of the most classic scenes in movie history. The other stories with Butch and Pumpkin and Hunny Bunny are not as great but still are very good. The soundtrack has to be one of the best in recent history. I think the ""Gimp"" scene when I first watched it, had me going crazy over what the hell the ""Gimp"" was. When it was revealed it was not only shocking, I was speechless. After watching it, of course the mystery is gone but you still get a sense of shock. Well if you haven't seen this movie your nuts because this has got to be one of the Top 10 films ever made."
21 May 2020,gantzbasset,0,1,10,Nihilism at its best,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence."""

                        ",It's 4:20; Do you know where Pulp Fiction is? Spoiler with Chaser!,"I finally saw this film for the first time in 2002.  I read some of the info on IMDb before seeing it, I remember that it seemed to contain more goofs than any other film that I have looked up on IMDb.  What little I knew about the film made me biased.  I, of course watched it carefully and analytically yet I still didn't pick up on any of the little nuances.  Where are all these alleged clocks that say the time is four-twenty???  Who made up that up??? I guess I'm not quick enough to appreciate Tarantino's commitment to detail. The only thing I was able to question was that the background in the cab scene was pretty chintsy but I thought that it was deliberate to give it a 1940's film-noir kinda feel.It's mildly funny and quite philosophical.Even after seeing it, I still feel like I have not seen it yet!  Does anyone know where I can get a ""real"" version of the film?  It was not what I expected.  I guess ANY slight knowledge of this particular film is an ultimate spoiler.  I didn't see how Uma Thurman's character had to do with the whole thing.  I would have edited her out completely, yet she was the movie's marketing image.   However, I think the cast and acting was bar-none.  Overall a great experimental attempt and a stepping stone of films that followed.  At least I know why my friends have changed since 1994 in their speech and attitude.  This could have been an interesting blaxploitation film if it had been released circa 1976.  I would say the movie is like (Deliverance) meets (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels)I don't see what the big fuss over this movie was, though it did have an personal impact on me.  Makes me think everyone around me has a gun."
1 March 2007,thecubanratio,1,2,10,Amazing!,"This movie is probably the best movie I've ever see. It combines a crazy plot outline with even better characters. Some of the absolutely pointless dialogue and profanity is what is so essential to making this movie what it is and what makes it so unique: Sam Jackson's arguments with Travolta, Travolta's dialogue with Uma Thurman, and Willis's dialogue with his girlfriend. Not only that, but it allows the viewer to judge almost everything up to his/her own interpretation; the ""miracle"", marsellus wallace's case, etc. It has an amazing cast and director as well. The way in which it is filmed and placed out of chronological order makes the viewer think and, for some reason, makes the story seem a lot better. References to the Bible, theories about Marsellus's bandage and case, and the ""miracle"" like I mentioned before will probably make this movie one of the most disputed movies of all time.

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is bold, profane, and violent. Combine the three and you have one of the finest films ever made. The constant violence may not appeal to everyone, but it is necessary to give you an in-depth look at what life in gangland is really like.It's a movie full of ingenuity and has something that directly grips viewer's thought. It is a movie which includes elements that challenges the boundary of conventional film making. The film has amazing structure and screenplay. Witty and zany dialog pervade this tumultuous film of violence and decadence. The characters are all incredible and each role is filled with a great actor who obviously relishes the chance to perform in this movie."

Perfect in about every way, Pulp is very funny, and the acting is top notch. Each scene has purpose, the film needs them for the stories to flawlessly connect with each other. Not for everyone, but if you get a chance to watch it, DO IT!"
27 December 2007,superstar_carnage,0,2,10,Absolute classic!,"Pulp Fiction is one for the ages. The 1994 film scripted and directed by Quentin Tarantino is simply a classic. Its witty and unique plot is sadistically humorous, offbeat and just plain and simply cool. The characters are edgy and unconventional put together with offbeat and sometimes pointless dialogue, which is a trait of Tarantino's which is thoroughly enjoyable. The film is driven on with an all-star cast with now Hollywood A-Listers and has a classy soundtrack.The film is featured around 3 stories, which are presented in a non-linear way. The movie has a pre-title sequence featuring a foul-mouthed couple who rob liquor stores sitting in a coffee shop talking about bigger and better places to rob. The first story seen after the opening credits features a brief introduction with two hit men, Vincent and Jules, picking up a suitcase from their bosses business partners. After retrieving the case the movie cuts to the pair outside their bosses place of business wearing short-shorts and t-shirts referred to later in the movie as looking like they're going to a volleyball game. The audience has little time to speculate as to how they got the clothes as we see the arrival of a new character Butch, who has a run-in with Vincent. Throughout the introduction to the first part, we are told that Vincent has been given the duty of taking his bosses wife out and keep her company while he is out of town. The first story features Vincent and his boss's wife and the trouble that they get into.The second story is based around Butch and Marsellus Wallace (Vincent's boss). We are given some insight to the story in a dialogue seen during the first story between Butch and Marsellus talking about Butch throwing his last fight as a boxer. Butch doesn't throw the fight and Marsellus is now after him. The story revolves around a gold watch that holds some significance to Butch, his girlfriend who forgets to take the watch with her when she leaves the house to go to a motel, now forces Butch to go back to get his watch from his house. While on his way back to the motel he runs into Marsellus.The final story is a continuation of the part when Vincent and Jules collect the case and how they got from wearing their suits into the short shorts and t-shirts. The closing part of the movie is back in the coffee shop. This time we see Vincent and Jules talking, with glimpses of the couple from the start, who unbeknownst to Vincent or Jules or any of the other customers are about to the hold the place up.Pulp Fiction propelled Tarantino into stardom and the movie itself received its share of grace and disgrace. Although considered by some a cinematic masterpiece (myself included), some, despite its brilliant screenplay, see it as a grotesque and vulgar film, because of its over-the-top gore and gritty coarse language and occasional vulgar dialogue topics.Pulp Fiction is not a movie for everyone. If you enjoy witty dialogue scenes, unconventional characters and an offbeat non-linear plot, then this movie is definitely for you. However, if you find yourself easily offended by strong, vulgar coarse language and disturbing blood and gore scenes stay right away from this film. For me this movie is number one in my book."
14 April 2004,Weezerman,0,2,10,"Good runner for ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"". Yes, that's how good it is.","Forget every single thing you think you know about movies. No other movie (at least movies released nowdays) can even compare to the twisting story of Pulp Fiction.LITTLE, TINY SPOILER AHEAD, BUT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH PLOT:
Split into three episodes, all intertwining into eachother, the variety here is endless. My favourite episode (The Bonnie Situation) pits John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in need of transporting a dead body, and have to get it out of Jimmy's (played by Quentin Tarantino himself) house before his wife gets home, or something big's gonna go down. That's all I'm gonna say.Before I ruin the movie for you, just go out and watch it for yourself. Trust me, you'll be amazed. Tarantino completely disregards traditional, linear filmmaking, and puts massive flair and style to a once drying formula.Overall rating: 10/10  Not many movies had me give this much attention to the plot.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!For those of you who have seen it, I bet you're questioning what's in the briefcase. Ahhh, one of the wonders of filmmaking. Something we'll probably never truly know."
31 March 2005,jcomins,0,6,5,While I understand why many people revere this movie...,"It is, all in all, a rather weak, flaccid, and uninspired picture.Spoilers herein. It's difficult to discuss Pulp Fiction's weaknesses without examples.Let me preface by making clear which points I am not hingeing this apparently uncommon opinion on: 1. I'm not worried about Tarantino's use of pop references; I rather like these--they make directors like T, Kevin Smith, and Ridley Scott stand out versus historical flak and cop dramas.2. I'm not against the unusual time structure. That said, more on this later.3. I'm not against any of the characters, actions (violence, sexual practices, etc), or decisions made in the film.4. I'm not against T's use of racial slurs; Quentin has very well-known theories on the subject, and that's his business.These are the most common complaints I have heard against Pulp Fiction. However, the reason(s) I think the movie is weak has more to do with content, plot, pacing, continuity, and development.My first point to consider is that the movie is, as T states in the opening credits, a series of unrelated stories. While each segment has elements that carry over to the next--characters, clothes, props, vehicles--any given segment could have different actors playing different characters and the movie would, in all honesty, not lose much. For example, John Travolta has several utterly unrelated roles, spanning the whole movie, that could have been played by anyone, as each of these roles has no relationship to any other. Just because it is Travolta who tells Jules about Amsterdam, who shoots Marvin, who takes Thurman out to dinner, and who is sent to shoot Willis, doesn't provide an adequate link between these events.Second, several very long scenes are essentially throwaway, added for the sake of chewing up time in a vaguely interesting way. The aforementioned Uma Thurman sequence is just a way for T to show off his knowledge of drugs and create a little suspense; Thurman's character doesn't even figure into the story/stories as a whole, and the mention of her by Jules earlier and her brief appearance later are clearly T's means of justifying her presence in the film. Also of note is the basement scene, which is so long and so far removed from the semblance of a plot that it is also clearly T showing off his knowledge of bdsm subculture while distracting the audience away from the flimsy profluence of the movie.Third, while there is nothing wrong with the characters per se, and I will be the first to admit that they are all a fun, likable bunch, a narrative American movie relies at least a little on character development. Aside from Butch, not a single character in Pulp Fiction changes in a meaningful way. ""Ah,"" you all shout, ""what about Jules? It seems like he changes a great deal,"" you continue. Sorry. No. Character development means that a character grows, and learns, and becomes better, or worse, or different, or the same but for somewhat different reasons, ad nauseum. It does not mean that a contrived and silly plot point suddenly opens your eyes to the presence of God in your LA sleazy-gangster lifestyle. Disney tried that in 'The Fox and the Hound' and it didn't work then, either.Lastly, I come to the infamous narrative structure. In a film class I took once, there was an entire chapter in the textbook devoted to Travolta's miraculous resurrection. ""Wow,"" was the impression the book gave. ""Holy moly."" When I subsequently saw Pulp Fiction, I went to my film professor and said, ""So?"" I still fail to see how this was groundbreaking in 1994, as I now fail to see past the purely gimmick nature of it. I don't believe it enhances the film in any way. It's barely interesting or worth keeping track of, like Memento is. ""Oh, but it ends where it begins!"" you interject. Yes, well so did (not wanting to give the endings away, I will use oblique references) that Kurosawa comedy based on John Ford's early westerns, as did that relentlessly popular early German Expressionist film with a bad rock band named after it, as did that Gilliam flick which you saw last week. They did it, too, and no one cared.I don't mean that quite so sarcastically, but there you are.One last point: there is one gimmick in Pulp Fiction, amongst a freight liner-full that don't work, that does work: the bizarre references to religion. The manner of locomotion of Marcellus Wallace's soul is clever and weird enough to drive the relevant scenes, as is Jules' Biblical speech (""For I AM the LORD!""). I like that, a bit. It adds depth, a millimeter or two, to a very shallow movie.And Pulp Fiction is indeed a shallow movie. One watches it, turns off the DVD player, and walks away, unchanged. There is no legitimate conflict, or plot, or character development, or anything. Sure, it's fine as a pure low-level entertainment flick with a good script, but I could just watch Snatch or Pitch Black, which serve the same purpose and have the same plusses as PF (including atemporal editing) but with some excitement and emotion to boot. Or, alternatively, I could watch Battleship Potemkin or The Bicycle Thief. A bit more sophisticated, those.On the other hand, if I'm in the mood for a slick LA sleazy-gangster film, a slick LA sleazy-gangster film by Quentin Tarantino, I might add, I'd just pop in Jackie Brown or Reservoir Dogs, both of which are truly excellent in all respects."
31 January 2016,joelbrown137,0,0,8,It's Tarantino Time.,"So I recently watched Pulp Fiction again for about the fifth time, and I think that it is a great piece of film making. The acting in the film are very well and the characters have very wide arc, there are more than one dimension to these characters that the audience understands. The performances of these characters, and this is a good thing because there are a lot of sequences of these characters driving the narrative forward. Another good thing that I like about this film is that the cinematography and how well this film is shot and the film shows that Tarantino knows how to shot the films that he makes. I think that the narrative is very good but is very complex and is for an advanced audience. The film is very good but not perfect. I feel like the some sequences drag on to long, and there are some sequences that are too over the top like the sequence where Butch kills Vincent Vega, the shooting sequence is over the top and there are other sequences like this. Overall I like this film but Tarantino takes some sequences over the top and this takes the film down. Overall I like this film and I think the editing, acting, direction, cinematography and script is written very well, this is a recommendation to anyone."
2 July 2019,drepanetworld,1,2,10,Review,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
18 December 2021,ciscocarrionj,0,1,9,A classic,This is a classic movie that everyone and their mother enjoys. The various storylines keeps the viewer on their feet. The ending really explains it all but there still is a mystery behind the movie itself as portrayed in different scenes.
29 December 2010,olie2008,0,1,10,An intelligently woven tale of crime life in a world that can 'Only exist in the Movies',"Having triumphed with his Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino soon began work on his second feature film: Pulp Fiction. Set in a world that only Mr. Tarantino himself could imagine, Pulp Fiction tells the tale of small time organised crime. Beginning fantastically with the electric and meaty dialogue of Pumkin and Honeybunny, played be Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, Pulp Fiction's opening Diner scene acts as a prelude to the crescendo that soon follows. The characters of both Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, played skillfully by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, soon become modern day cinema catalysts for the punchy and fast dialogue that inspired a generation of young filmmakers. Tarantino's masterpiece is concluded with standout performances from Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel, ensuring that Pulp Fiction became one of the most significant films of the nineties if not of all time."
3 October 2007,sean_baker1,1,2,9,Close To Perfection,"Pulp Fiction has to be the closest a director has come to creating a masterpiece!!! Tarantino has assembled an All-Star cast, written one of the most creative scripts to date, and cleverly directed arguably the movie of the 90's.... Pulp Fiction The film is usually labeled as an action film, although to be honest, the film creates its own genre. A genre most of Tarantino's films can be categorized under.. as his films all have this mood and feel to them, which he has achieved through the brilliance of his script and direction.The casting for this movie is spot on. Travolta (Who plays one half of a hit-man Duo), must have thanked Tatantino for arguably reviving his career. Travolta fictional character, Vincent Vega, was the perfect way for him to be acknowledged by critics and steer him away from his musical/good-boy image.Arguably the star of the film is Samuel L. Jackson. His role as Jules Winfield, is the role I'm sure he shall be remembered by. It know wonder he was nominated for an Academy Award.Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames & Uma Thurman also give memorable performances, ones which arguably igniting there careers, especially helping Willis remove his image as a Action-Hero.If i was told to recommend one film to anybody... this would always be the film which first comes to mind, as Pulp Fiction is quite truly Tarantino Brilliance.'Bring Out The Gimp'"
23 February 2013,aripyanfar,0,1,10,The (Hidden?) Moral message of Pulp Fiction.,"Without naming character names, I have to point out a few plot conclusions that many people seem to miss amidst the overwhelmingly stylish cinematography and the clever time jumps. Two of the main characters consciously decide to get out of a life of crime. Tarantino lets them get away, and those characters get to live.The people who stay in the life: bad things happen to most of them. Very bad things. And being killed is only one of the nasty outcomes.As for the drug taking, from the cinematography point of view, it's hilarious AND stylish. BUT right in your face is also the picture of drugs completely interfering with two people being able to connect. Even on a date together they are too out of it to relate in any way or form a bond.Not to mention the stunningly impactful finish to the drug outing. Oh yeah, that's a great filmic high for the audience. But YEEAARCH. The underlying message is clearly: ""Drugs are bad, M'kay?"""
19 August 2006,pokerlegend89,1,4,10,The Best Movie Ever Created,"Pulp Fiction is the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life !!! To begin with the actors are great,Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta,Uma Thurman and Mel Gibson did a great job acting in this movie. The story was also good especially because it wasn't linear, the whole movie was a puzzle of scenes and it all came together at the end of the movie. The dark humor in the movie was very great as well, i have laughed a lot while i was seeing this movie. And it also was the first movie i saw that was directed by Tarantino and i immediately fell in love with his style and his dark humor. so people everyone should see this movie it's great."
21 July 2015,eoinkearney-46755,0,1,10,Excellent in every way,"This is one of the best movies ever made. The reason why is believable dialogue, excellent acting and compelling writing add these and have it set in the bedrock of pop culture and you instantly get a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino knows cinema and it shows as he films are a love letter to cinema and cinema fans. The visuals and lighting give a cool and stylish glow. Pulp fiction is also perfectly paced as it set up time to establish characters without dragging. A most see for anyone over 12 if they are mature enough to appreciate cinema also if you are a sensitive viewer be warned some scenes are a bit intense. The soundtrack is composed of pop songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s that seem to be inappropriate at first but when you see the point if the movie you'll understand why"
21 September 2017,AndrewRozarioOfficial,0,0,10,Nice Nice Nice,"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
15 May 2019,jteller-39689,0,0,9,Tarantino at his best,As the title implies the movie is a series of events right out of a toss away paper from the news stand but that doesn't stop them from being extremely entertaining. The lives of the characters are all intertwined by the mob. Jackson and Travolta are hitmen sent after money stolen from their boss who happen across a pair of bank robbers who are a little of kilter. Willis is a boxer paid to throw a fight and Thurman is the bosses wife. This unlikely group of characters each have a crazy story and with expert manipulation and story telling Tarantino mixes it all around so you never know what's coming next but you're always more than happy to keep watching.
22 March 2006,gavinmacuk,0,2,9,Wow,"Again Quentin Tarantino at his best with this action packed film. Pulp Fiction is based around the life of gangsters in America, and shows you their problems, and what stuff they do to get out of them. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are the best, they are so funny. I love the bit when Samuel Jackson goes over the speed bump and John Travolta shoots that Marvin dude in the face, the blood just goes everywhere. Bruce Willis plays a good part in it as well as a cool guy on the run from nasty boss Ving Rhames.(Who later gets raped which is horrible). Again if you like this film try Reservoir Dogs which is just like this, or maybe try the Kill Bill films. Quentin Tarantino directs films with such superb drama techniques, such as: Flashbacks, Cross Cutting etc. He is the directer of the century."
3 April 2019,vaniharish-54223,0,0,9,A mind boggling masterpiece of a movie experience,"Pulp Fiction, popularly regarded as Tarantino's best work till time, is undeniably one of the most gruesome and unusual movies you'll have the opportunity of savouring.Right from the very beginning, this masterpiece of a movie, has the potential to keep you at the edge of your seats, biting your nails, delivering wild guesses as to what is going to happen in the due course of the film. The extremely unique and atypical style of story telling, which is indisputably Tarantino's trademark, undoubtedly sets Pulp Fiction apart from its counterparts. The same story if narrated chronologically, wouldn't have been as enthralling and mind boggling as the way it is.The next thing that deserves recognition is its impeccable casting and the sublime performances delivered by the now veterans. The true gist of the movie could not have been savoured if it weren't for the unparalleled and skillful execution by its cast members.Coming down to it's plot, the movie revolves around the lives of Jules Winnfield, Vincent Vega, Butch, Marcellus Wallace and Mia Wallace, delineated by Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman respectively. All of them are portrayed to be leading a debaucherous lifestyle one way or the other. The fact that the various incidents fall in line only after two and a half hours of an adrenaline pumping experience, is what makes pulp Fiction different from typical gangster movies.Although the movie glorifies violence and iniquity in its due course, the fact that the protagonist is a god fearing man who, in time, seeks redemption and sets his mind on withdrawing from immoral practices, is something that we do not typically expect from a gangster movie. The fact that he lets go of 'Pumpkin' and 'honey bunny' without hurting them, is in support of his vow, prior to the aforementioned incident.The movie sets a benchmark with regard to its magnificent script and otherworldly intense movie experience, inspiring you to re-watch it numerous times and never be tired of. Speaking for myself, it surely is not the most brutal movie that we have been gifted with from Tarantino. I personally am of the opinion that Kill Bill has an edge over Pulp Fiction, which outshines Django Unchained when it comes down to Tarantino films. With ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" at bay, it is guaranteed that binge watching Tarantino films is definitely not something that you would regret."
15 December 1999,Macca31,0,1,10,Maybe the greatest film ever made,"Despite its release in 94, i have only seen Pulp Fiction recently. I watched it in amazement. Then, when it had finished, I watched it again.!!WARNING: Contains some plot points that could be considered as SPOILERS!!Plot: PF focuses on three tales of low-life gangsters in LA. They are VINCENT VEGA (Travolta) JULES (Jackson) and a host of others, namely BRUCE WILLIS, UMA THURMAN, and HARVEY KEITEL. The film is told in a very non-linear format, with the end in the middle and the start at the end etc. But the stories are incredibly well-written and woven. In Pulp you will witness scenes with some of the finest dialogue ever!! Tarantino is clearly very talented and it shines through here.SCENES TO LOOK OUT FOR: Butch Coolidge (WILLIS) deciding what weapon to use to kill the rapists.Travolta accidentally shooting Marvin in the faceA lovely cameo by Tarantino as JIMMIEPumpkin and Honeybunny in the restaurantSamuel L.Jackson's bible recites.Overall the plot is very well done.CAST: Packed full of stars, the cast of PF is an excellent one. Great actors and actresses put in career performances with a little help from Tarantino. Willis and Jackson are the main men, but Ving Rhames is excellent. Christopher Walken and Steve Buscemi make excellent cameos along with Tarantino. Thurman was good yet under-used. Travolta was fairly cool. To be fair, there was not much wrong with the film's actors at all. A good choice of cast: WELL DONE!Warning: The film, whilst not glorifying violence or drug abuse, has some strong drug and violence scenes. Despite this, it is a funny and entertaining film, but if u r easily offended by the previous elements, have caution. BUT DONT LET IT RUIN THIS EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME! Watch PF right now!Mark: 9.5/10(Only because maybe nothin in life is 100% perfect)"
12 May 2006,conorguiney,0,1,9,Tarantino's violent gangster epic,"The movie that shot QT to the top, Pulp Fiction is a no-holds barred slug fest that leaves the viewer with a bad taste in their mouth. Watching it for the first time a couple of years ago i was shocked to see how violent Hollywood movies can get, ever since then i've been desensitized to all slash and gash movies.After making his debut with Reservoir Dogs which received average reviews, QT hit back with the ""Pulp"", with an eye popping cast, hilarious set design and great directing from the man himself you won't go wrong by buying Pulp Fiction.With the ever memorable opening sequence with Jules and Vincent talking about getting high in hash bars in Amsterdam and the extreme violence that ensues between Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallce this is definitely QT's best film today.The script is very much unique and unwinds at every turn, one question i'd ask QT is where does he get this stuff. The script takes a stab at every thing from Amsterdam hash bars, to what the french call a quarter pounder in McDonalds, it even quotes the bible, with the notorious passage which Jules recites before ever killing sends a chill up the viewers spine.""Pulp"" was the movie that resurrected John Travolta's career, made Uma Thurman a star and brought a new respect to the whole crime genre."

                        ",Still got it,"""Pulp Fiction"" has always been up there for me, and it has been a long time since I've seen this film, but I marvel at its complexity, both in its form and its meaning.When Jules utters ""lets get into character"" at the beginning of the film(near the end, depending on how you look at it), Tarentino is forcing us to examine what is fictitious and what is real. His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to ""wander the earth"" as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures.Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus' wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction."
19 January 2022,sofiaaskina,0,0,9,my most favorite movie,"Three five-year-olds ago, Tarantino took on the Cannes Film Festival and then tried to clean up the American Film Academy - but without much success: he got only a consolation Oscar for the script. Although who knows how things could have turned out, don't get in the way of Robert Zemeckis's ""Reading..."" ""Forrest Gump."" The circumstances were such that it was possible to call this film by a self-taught director a ""new classic"" literally a month after it was released on the screen; today it's even kind of scary to get close to a non-film. A hit of hits, a cornerstone, an example for everyone.Neither before nor after, there was so much air and life in postmodern quote sets. By some miracle, ""Pulp Fiction"" overcame the concentrated Tarantino desire to take the best of the best. Twist and John Travolta, Vietnam and Christopher Walken, cannon and sermon, boxing gloves and chopper, chatter and more chatter. Indicative in this sense is the scene in which Butch (Bruce Willis), who escaped from perverts, chooses what to do with the offenders: a hammer? A baseball bat? Chainsaw? Samurai sword! The breadth of Tarantino's capabilities is fascinating. Therefore, ""Reading..."" is not a zany collection of cinematic curiosities, but the very meat of cinema, the flesh torn and sewn for a new life. Pulp. Dramaturgically sorted ""Pulp fiction"" exists according to the laws of the road movie."

                        ",very good film,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."
1 October 2011,anush_sukumar,0,2,10,Pulp Victory,"The first time I saw Pulp Fiction I thought how could anyone direct such a CRAP! Seriously!!! What would you tell about a movie which has only dialogues and some speck of action!The movie started with Tim Roth and his Girlfriend Amanda Plummer talking in a coffee shop.This went on for the first ten minutes!!Okay fine...maybe it might get better?Then out of no where both of them pull out their guns and hold the coffee shop for ransom!Strange but unpredictable...oh !!!There could be some action now!!After the credits are done, a completely different scene with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson starts,in a conversation again !!God!! Save the talk!!!!! some action please now at least!!This was just the kind of mind I had for the first twenty minutes itself.Imagine what a frame of mind i would have been,for the rest of the movie!!After the movie was over, with a sadistic frame of mind I wanted to enjoy the pleasure of how the critics would have beaten up this movie to the core(thats what I thought..but)....... in IMDb.But the minute I opened pulp fiction webpage,I was flabbergasted!!What the hell!!Are people so bland in their taste?A rating of 9/10 was given even more than DARK KNIGHT(my fave movie then).As a movie freak I was so inquisitive, that I saw the movie again the next day.The critics had asked the audience to only to listen to the dialogues.Fine lets listen to what the dialogues have got!!Back to the coffee shop scene again!Tim roth and Amanda plummer start discussing the idea of robbing banks.Then they try to reason out why to rob just banks:Why not some other place where their is cash and no problem of security like the coffee shop they were sitting in!Then Amanda says to do it now!Then they pull out there guns and hold the shop for ransom!!... The conversation WAS pretty much logical and refreshingly different!!The conversation between John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson was actually good and definitely funny in a strange way especially about the ""foot massage""!!The way Jackson then kills his enemy after his beautiful monologue-EZEIKEL 25:17 was exactly like watching Rajnikanth's punch dialogues!!As the movie went on my perspective about it changed! A cactus to a beautiful sunflower !Metaphors do come handy at times!!After watching this movie my taste,my ideas,my interests for watching movies completely changed!!!This movie actually taught me a lesson as to how to approach a movie-to never to always look at the style or pace in the screenplay,but to look at something beyond these petty things,something I thought had no value-DIALOGUES ..This movie was known to be a genre bending movie of all times!YES ,IT SURELY IS!I would also accept the fact that,this is the first black comedy I have watched.The first movie I had seen, where the violence is seen from a different aspect.You will never find the violence morose, unbearable or sadistic to watch as in the director's previous movie Reservoir Dogs ,but you might find it surprisingly entertaining.This non linear crime drama directed by Quentin Tarantiono(enemy then, guru now),has bagged names like postmodern film and neo noir film as its narrative structure is completely opposite to a normal straight forward narration and the characters are anti heroic characters in the film.If you are looking at the plot of the movie-There is no definite plot.That is why it has been haled as a masterpiece which defines nothing at all.The story as such is 4 intertwined tales of violence and redemption of 2 hit-man(Travolta,Jackson), a boxer(Bruce Willis) and a gangster's wife(Uma Thurman).This movie surprisingly won the Oscar only for screenplay(Tarantino and Roger Avary)!!What annoyed me was the fact that Jackson As the Hit-man named ""jules"" did not win for his superlative performance.He deserved it more for his EZEIKEL 25:17 dialogue's explanation at the end in his redemptive mood.....All the other actors like John Travolta,Uma Thurman,Ving Rhames and Bruce willis have done a commendable job.The highlight of this movie is the non linear narration of the story and Tarantino's usual style-unpredictability!Another aspect about this movie is the pleasant and eclectic background music fusing the violence to the entertaining mood of the film.I would like to conclude by saying that please don't assess a movie like I did without really understanding it-Its sheer cockiness.I would highly recommend this movie for lovers of black comedies and the rest the world because it does not make you think,but will keep you glued to this movie AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW THE DIALOGUES.Lastly please don't expect to learn everything about this movie as such from this review as I will only tell you what I felt.I only will give you the wood and would ask you to enjoy the pleasure of rubbing the wood hard and lighting fire yourself,by watching the movie yourself.!! This movie is a sure PULP VICTORY!!!!"

This unique way of story telling, being used by the mastermind of Tarantino, adds to an already flawless movie.The movie consists of various diffrent stories which at the end are revealed to be one bigger story. Extortions, vilonecne, gambling, bribing, narcotics and murders are a few of the elements of a movie full of action drama and twists.Trying to be as objective as posible, one should mention, the role of Tarantino as one of the actors, is not the best option. While his brilliancy in directing and writing is evident, his acting skils are definitely not on par. However, one should not fixate on that, but rather appreciate the movie as a whole."

Jackson, and John Travolta. It is by far a classic film and it will be remembered for a very long time. This is until CGI takes over, which Pulp Fiction doesn't have much of. When you watch Pulp Fiction, Terrintino likes to use unique and idealistic camera angles to keep the plot moving, even when he is just using diolouge. For instance, in one scene, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are talking down the hallway and the camera is waiting at the door. It's almost like the camera is waiting for the actors to come do the big scene. He also tells the story out of order which makes you think. This tecnique is also helpful to keep you involved through all of the diolouge (which is all classic). Pulp Fiction is by far one of the best movies alive.

26 November 2013,bryce_iwaschuk,1,2,10,The Side of 'Fiction' Beaten to a 'Pulp'.,"Before I could speak, I loved cinema and the films within it. I'd spent hours upon hours sitting, with my head leaning upon the television screen - probably why I now need glasses - and witness what others had to say about the world around them, or far away galaxies resting upon the edge of the universe. I was incorporated within the worlds of Winnie the Pooh, The Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, The Godfather, or Saving Private Ryan. I was infatuated with the entire concept behind it, and though my tastes may have broadened, few films have had such an impact on my view of cinema, as that of the Quentin Tarantino 1994 independent gem Pulp Fiction ever did. At first, it was the film's structure and creative dialogue that gripped me and hurled me headfirst into this idiosyncratic environment. Yet what I have come to love the most about the film, is how much I have in common with the director, and the brilliant structure he uses to showcase these interests better than I ever could. Because never has there been a director with such an infatuation towards film, that while watching his work, you could sense the satisfaction he derives through making it. Because of this, all of his films, and in particular Pulp Fiction, brim with cinematic allusions and pastiches. And as a self-reflexive postmodern film, it comes across as a crazy house of homages and unconventional filmmaking structures. However, Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece remains more than a bright neo-noir shock flick of gore and black humor - It's an ode to a genre, and a contradiction of everything wrong with it. The title: Pulp Fiction, is a reference to the Hard Boiled crime novels and Pulp Magazines popular throughout the mid- 20th century. They were thrillers or noir-like stories printed on cheap paper made of wood pulp, and would obtain suggestive, lurid, and violent graphic novels. Their characters were hard hitting, tough, and sexually inviting, all for 10 cents a copy. So yes, Tarantino's 1994 film contains the same content of these WWII magazines, and even has the gritty and rough look of the authentic paper they printed on. Yet the iconology is distinctive. As obsessed with cinema as he may be, Tarantino drew the line between reality and film. Unlike other memorable noirs such as The Maltese Falcon, Goodfellas, or the slightly more recent Drive (which I will add, are all suburb films), the characters were cardboard cutouts - being my main critique for the vintage novels, as well as these classic films. Yet, to look at Vincent Vega, Jules Winfield and Butch Coolidge, (the three main characters through- out Pulp Fiction,) it is easy to recognize real individuals, who are tough, and still have fear over a situation: such as when Jules' reacts to Vincent after he 'blows' Marvin's head off in the back seat of a car; and as well, don't spend ever hour of the day sitting at home, sharpening their knives. Although The Sopranos later perfected and brought reasoning to this fact, making their characters part of society and disguising themselves as members, Pulp Fiction places them within the daily activities of an odd group, distinguishes them from ordinary civilians, and keeps them afloat through simplistic dialogue demonstrating the needs and wants of a first world audience; such as relationships, religion, or something as simple as, what to eat for breakfast (, and I don't know about you, but I was thoroughly disappointed when Fabienne had to get Buttermilk pancakes instead of Blueberry).It feels like a cliché to say it, but for a long time Pulp Fiction was my favorite film. It was as influential to me in 2010, as it was to the people who first saw it in the mid-90s. I could go on for hours discussing the unconventional style of chronology, the homages to such films as The Bodyguard (: Jules' famous Ezekiel 25:17 biblical quote is shown within the films opening crawl), On The Waterfront (: Bruce Willis' character Butch's resemblance to Marlon Brando's character through a self-dilemma), or The Aristocats (: From the famous Twist-Dance contest where Uma Thurman bases her moves from that of the Duchess character in the 1970 Disney animation). Yet what makes the film so unique is not the homages to films or magazines mainstream audiences wouldn't recognize, nor the bleak humor, but through these characters and their reflections through an array of bizarre and oddly connected events. I continue to adore this film for several rationales, but to me, the people were always the most specific. They were original, just like the film, and shaped the American audience into viewers ready to find enjoyment from extraordinary people discussing foot massages and European hamburgers for several minutes of screen time. Quentin Tarantino... you are a genius!!!"
10 September 2021,jtrporrelli,0,0,8,Chance vs. Destiny,"Pulp Fiction is an absolute unicorn of a film. It first premiered twenty-six years ago and has aged fantastically; arguably one of Quentin Tarantino's best films. Somehow, the story has managed to remain fresh and unique, the dialogue sharp and cunning, the characters intriguing and memorable, music creates a sense of realism in the scenes, the camera work is impeccable. Truly the movie is almost flawless. It's gone on to become one of those movies that almost everyone has agreed is a must-watch, especially for those aspiring to make films. It transformed Tarantino's career, making him a household name and has inspired dozens of other filmmakers and movies. The only real question is: ""What makes Pulp Fiction so great?"" Is it the snappy dialogue? The memorable characters? The experiential camera work? The answer, in short, is no. While all of these elements help polish the film into a masterpiece, they are not the core of what makes it spectacular. Rather, it's the way Tarantino addresses the idea of random chance and pre-determined destiny that sets it apart.Most people believe that humans are free thinkers, that we have free will, and that everything that happens to us happens because of us and the choices we make. However, in Pulp Fiction, Jules, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and Vince, portrayed by John Travolta, debate this at length. On one hand, Jules chooses to believe that things happen for a reason. In a twisted sense of the idea, Jules is a Christian. He believes in a higher power and in divine intervention. Ultimately, he believes that his life has been pre-determined and that God has a bigger plan for him, whatever happens to him has nothing to do with his own actions, his actions only even happen because they must. Consequently, Jules chooses to perceive the world as a giant unsolvable puzzle where everything has a specific place. We can not randomly pick where the pieces are going because they are not designed to fit in more than one way. Life is not a series of random events that occur because of us, it is a predetermined puzzle that we must strive to solve. At least, that's how Jules lives.On the contrary, Vince believes that the world is entirely random. The TV Show ""Rick and Morty"" best captured this ideology in its first season by saying ""Nobody belongs anywhere. Nobody exists on purpose. Everybody is going to die. Come watch TV."" (Rick & Morty S:1/EP:8 - Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon) because he believes there is no god or greater plan. He believes that everything is driven by choices, rather than destiny. Things only happen to us because we make them happen. Life is a chaotic series of events that we have to manage and control. To him, life is not a picturesque puzzle with a predetermined outcome, but rather an endless bin of LEGO bricks. People throw their hands in the bin and grab a fistful of LEGO, so in turn, whatever blocks you pull out will be entirely random, but what we choose to build is our decision. Whether it stands strong or tumbles relies solely on those decisions. It's these fundamentals and opposing beliefs being crafted together in such a compelling manner that makes the decision of the audience between the two ideologies the crucial key to the success of the film.Throughout the entirety of Pulp Fiction, things unravel and progress in strange ways. For example, at the beginning of the film, two thieves choose to rob a diner where there should be no heroes, however, Jules is there. Skipping forward a little, Vince's drug dealer runs out of balloons and puts his drugs into a plastic baggy. Eventually, this allows for Mia Wallace to find it and overdose, conveniently Vince is in the washroom when she finds the drugs. After that fiasco, Butch should be fleeing town but goes back to his apartment for a watch, while Vince once again happens to be taking a dump. Then after Butch kills Vince and gets his watch, he happens to pull up in front of Marcellus Wallace as he's crossing the street. In turn, causing them to stumble into the one store that happens to be run by rapists. Plus of course, there's that time when Vince and Jules are shot at from point-blank range but all the shots miss them. All of Pulp Fiction plays out in what could only be defined as a random series of connecting events, but is it really random?The entire film demonstrates one massive domino effect. One event can not happen without the others, but the question remains: do these events happen because of the character's actions or is it all in spite of them? The audience is never given a clear answer. For example, Butch ends up killing Vince and having a crazy/ traumatizing experience with Marcellus because of that choice. He chooses to go back to his apartment and get his watch, even though he knows he should be leaving town for his own safety. That choice brings him into contact with both Vince and Marcellus. However, everything else that happens is random, as aforementioned. It's only chance that Butch got the upper hand on Vince and it's only chance that Marcellus was heading to the apartment at the exact same time Butch is leaving. The film alternates between chance and destiny as the driving mechanism, of the film.Unfortunately, Tarantino never offers a blunt answer. Instead, it's left up to the audience to decide what they believe, which is brilliant. The end of the film leaves the audience with the same unanswered questions as the characters. It creates a desire for us to return to the movie and begin studying it. The problem is that no matter how many times we watch Pulp Fiction, that question will only become more complicated and difficult to answer with every screening. Creating something that would resonate for decades with its viewers and forever leave them wanting more may be the most legendary feat any filmmaker could ever aspire to."
13 September 2006,muurahainen,0,2,9,very interesting,Very good music... beautifully shot.. Tarantino makes good movies.. this was very funny one.. although it was cruel... I liked the two lovers in the restaurant.. very funny indeed.. The stories were beautifully connected with each other.. Did I already say the music was very good?? Well it was. And the dancing competition. WOW! I love this movie!Just love it.. Samuel was very good and Bruce.. and you just have to love Uma and Travolta. Beautiful cast. Tarantino was also good when he appeared. He really knows how to make movies.. Beautiful movie.. you just got to see it. The MUSIC The MUSIC!!!! you just got to love it!! Tarantino movies always have very good music!
1 February 2007,quentinrules,0,2,10,Quentin Tarantino's Mona Licha,"one of the greatest films of all time what Quentin Tarantino has done is inspirational. although some critics have bashed the film for its graphic violence if you look at it its not that violent the scene were Bruce Willis gets the samurai sword and slashes on of the guys raping Marcellus u don't actually see the cut, you see it after but nothing as extreme as kill bill or certain films at the time. also the fact that it is said to have more swearing and or violence then his first film reservoir dogs is not true in Australia (were i live) our rating system used to have everything in levels so if something had small bit of violence as in action violence it would have low level violence if a film such as south park which has lots of swearing has high level coarse language they have this for all things except for references. my point is that reservoir dogs was classed to have high level realistic violence and cars language while pulp only had medium level violence and language"
19 January 2022,mikhailovskiymisha,0,0,10,TARANTINOS FICTION,"The message in ""Cars"" is simplicity itself: Life was better in the old days, when it revolved around small towns where everybody knew each other, and around small highways like Route 66, where you made new friends, sometimes even between Flagstaff and Winona. This older America has long been much-beloved by Hollywood, and apparently it survives in Radiator Springs as sort of a time capsule.Doc Hudson, it turns out, was a famous race car in his day. That leads up to a race in which the vet and the kid face off, although how that race ends I would not dream of revealing. What I will reveal, with regret, is that the movie lacks a single Studebaker. The 1950s Studebakers are much beloved by all period movies, because they so clearly signal their period, from the classic Raymond Loewy-designed models to the Golden Hawk, which left Corvettes and T-Birds eating its dust. Maybe there's no Hawk in Radiator Springs because then Doc Hudson would lose his bragging rights.The movie is great to look at and a lot of fun, but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films. Maybe that's because there's less at stake here, and no child-surrogate to identify with. I wonder if the movie's primary audience, which skews young, will much care about the 1950s and its cars. Maybe they will. Of all decades, the 1950s seems to have the most staying power; like Archie and Jughead, the decade stays forever young, perhaps because that's when modern teenagers were invented."
2 May 2007,rushmutt,0,2,10,like a graphic novel,"this was a great movie in my opinion it is similar to the movie sin city as crime/noir as the main genre and being set up like a graphic novel, this movie is in a graphic novel format because it is divided into chapters, the first scene they show the definition of pulp 1 of those meanings is a magazine or book containing lurid material its better to like story almost or as well as action which i do so i like this movie. Quenton Tarintino did an excellent job directing. This movie isn't great for kids but if you believe your child can handle it go ahead. also similar to sin city due to multiple story lines making a story. This movie has well developed characters (i.e a heroine addicted mafia enforcer, a boxer who isn't afraid to kill, a mafia enforcer who recites a bible passage). A difference from your average movie. 1 time where the critics are right."
5 August 2007,wellmaketime,0,2,10,They're wont be a film like this for years,"Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a masterpiece of cinema. It stands as one of the all-time greatest films. It beats out even The Godfather, and perhaps Citizen Kane. Everything about this masterwork is stunning, the way Tarantino embellishes and, finally, interlinks these old chestnuts that makes the film alternately exhilarating and frustrating.It's the perfect prelude to the body of Pulp Fiction, an anthology of three luridly overblown, chronologically deviant stories, their narratives linked via characters who slide from one segment to the other as easily as a moll onto her sugar daddy's knee. Tarantino's characters may be goons, but they are also inveterate fat-chewers on par with the boys at Barry Levinson's ""Diner."" As the boss's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), says to henchman Vincent (John Travolta), ""When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."" The performances are witty and eccentric, and the fine cast proves they can pull off extremely complex, unique charatcers. True to his nature, Tarantino stuffs ""Pulp Fiction"" with movie references, but its true strength is in turning these on end. The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel, a little bit tiring, a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers. When bits of brain cling to Jules's oily ringlets, not everybody is going to laugh, perhaps because they have been too close to someone who has been the victim of a shotgun blast. Maybe we're laughing because we're too shellshocked by what we have become to cry."
7 June 2013,linkinpark45,0,1,10,A movie that always cheers me up!,"I won't use any fancy words or hard-to-understandable words, but this movie is definitely a landmark. The dark comedy in stressful situations, the vulgar language, the superb acting and story and a director, who is a genius in what he does best - filmmaking - makes this movie so unique, so recognizable and so good, that every time i see this, i'm always in a good mood. Some of the most memorable scenes, like a gangster dictating a bible passage before opening fire, an accidental shooting in a car and a one- night-date that ends with o.d-ing on drugs are probably behind the movies success. I'd give it more than 10, if i could, because this is a masterpiece of violence, comedy and crime; should be noted that this movie produces more laughs then some ''comedy movies'' i've seen in a while. An Oscar for writing well deserved, he should have won the best director too!"
24 February 2004,DKline1278,0,2,9,Movies have changed because of Pulp Fiction,"*****Spoilers*****This is one of the greatest movies of the 90's, if not the greatest. The direction and editing are bar none above almost anything else that was put out at that time. The script circles a lot around F bombs but that's ok because it gets it's point across. The 3 stories this movie goes around are hilarious, action packed, and drama filled. It has everything you want in a movie, all though there is no real love story sorry ladies.
This is the movie that launched Samuel L. Jackson's now amazing career, and to think it may have never happened as he almost lost the part. John Travolta also came back completely because of this movie. Ving Rhames has gone on to be just a bad man (in a good way) because of this movie. It opened a lot of peoples eyes to Uma Turman as well, even though it was almost 10 years later in another Tarantino movie before she really got back to the ""mainstream"". Harvey Keitel, who is an underrated actor in a great role. Tim Roth, one of Tarantino's favorites, is good in the small role he has. Plus Bruce coming in on a very un Bruce like low key role. Now I know a lot of people reading this would disagree but this is also the movie that opened everyone up to Tarantino, I know Reservoir Dogs is highly considered a better movie but this brought him into the lime light. So we have Pulp Fiction to thank for all of the above, some are upset about the Travolta part but hey in the right role he's an amazing actor.The way the movie just jumps around w/the end being in the middle and the middle being in the end was genious. At the time I couldn't say I'd ever seen anything like it befor. The fact that the movie is more about the dialogue than anything else is what separates PF from a lot of other movies of this type of genre. While the action in the movie is very entertaining it's what is coming out of the charaters mouths that drives the movie. To quickly introduce some of the characters. You have Jules/Jackson quoting from the Bible. Vincent/Travolta with his now infamous Royal with Cheese conversation. Wallace/Rhames being just a bad dude and delivering his lines a smooth as anyone. Mia/Thurman and her quirky character. The Wolf/Keitel just coming in and smoothing everything over as only the Wolf can. I know i'm being vague w/details but if you haven't seen this movie stop reading the review and go watch it, if you have seen it your hopefully getting my point. Spoilers below.The action should not be dismissed, it is very well done. You have the very well put together way of Butch/Wills not throwing his fight but you don't see it all you see is him running out of the building. Then him meeting up w/Wallce later and running him over in a his car. The following part at the pawn shop is both disturbing and funny. The whole part of when we see Vincent and Jules going to collect from the kids who stole from Wallace is brilliant. Right down to the kid coming out of the bathroom with, as Vincent puts it, a ""Hand cannon"". Then there is my favorite part of the movie. The Vincent and Mia date. This is just so well put together the dialogue between the two of them is great, plus the sexual tension between them adds a little drama too it. Then the drug overdose that happens at the end is gut renching and is what makes it my favorite part of the movie. There is the ""Bonnie Situation"" which as sad as it is that someone dies in the beginning of that part of the story that it is one of the funniest parts of PF. This is where we meet Tarantino, a good role for him to play even if he's not the best actor in the world. Heck you can stand him in it because everyone else is so great. The Wolf is also in this part of the story as a basic Mr. fix it guy who comes in and saves Vincent and Jules after what they did to the poor kid in the car. The last one is, I know I went out of order and if I forgot anything I appologize, the robbery at the coffee shop. This is what made Jackson in my opinion, his banter with Travolta in this sceen is once again great. BUT what makes it is when Jules/Jackson won't let Roth's character take the brief case. When he has Roth at gun point and starts to talk that is some of the best acted and spoken dialogue you'll see maybe ever.In closing I appologize for the review being jumpy and not well put together, when I think about this movie so many things come to mind as it is non stop from beginning to end with no slow parts. For 2 1/2 hours your just sitting on the edge of your seat because you have no idea what is going to happen next. That's how I felt watching it in '94. Now movies have changed a lot from back then, in part I think, because of this movie so you may not feel the same way as I did watching it then. It holds the test of time as well now 10 years later. So if you read this review and haven't seen the movie, I appologize if I gave too much away but go and watch it now and let us know what you think. I would give this movie 3 1/2 out of 4 stars (I don't give a lot of 4 stars btw)"
29 March 2012,danielsefton3,1,2,10,"A personal favourite, Tarantino's attention to detail makes the film what it is.","I am sure this has been said before, but Pulp Fiction is one of my favourite movies. I have watched it numerous times and with each viewing more details appear, it is almost impossible to suggest that one would be able to predict every twist and every turn that occurs in this film. Tarantino breaks the typical chronological order in which a movie usually functions, this is what makes Pulp Fiction so intelligent it is a particularly unusual feeling that occurs when the movie comes full circle and returns to the beginning as a means to conclude. It is a tool he can use to provoke different reactions from viewers, for example the death of a main character (Vincent) during the middle of the movie comes as a shock especially when he resurrects unscathed scenes later. It is the lack of chronology that allows Tarantino to play with his characters whilst keeping their roles prominent. This is never easy when applied to a movie in chronological order for example the death of Llewellyn moss in 'No Country for Old Men' leaves the focus on Anton Chigurh (though this is a Coen Brothers production and not a Tarantino one it still assists in illustrating the importance of Tarantino's chronological confusion.)As well as Tarantino's intelligent filming method he uses a cast that match their character's personality, for example Samuel L Jackson usually plays the role of a tough yet eccentric and interesting type and Christopher Walken plays tends to play knowledge filled and enigmatic characters. I am in no way saying these actors are generic, I merely scrape the surface of what they are capable of. Tarantino's characters (as well as other roles played by these actors) have detailed and interesting back-stories which add a significant amount of detail to the plot. he leaves the viewer with such quotable phrases such as Jules' ""Ezekiel 25:17"" passage (which I have found is a favourite when friends come to quote the movie.)As if the plot, characters and dialogue is not enough to gain the viewer's undivided attention it is padded with a number of details that are not directly linked to the plot yet still add interesting twists to the story. This is why the movie has to be viewed at least twice to understand most of the aspects that occur. It is Tarantino's intelligent use of the minor details that make this film what it is. For example the significance of his characters in relation to his other films (when given insight) is mind-blowing. Vincent Vega being a direct link to Reservoir Dogs' 'Vic Vega'. And the consistent time on all of the clocks . Agreed I have only touched the surface of what this movie is about, yet the detail on which this film is based cannot be put directly into words, I can simply pick up on the intelligent use of dialogue, characters the numerous twists and turns that occur and the small yet significant details that can be observed. So I really do suggest you give it a watch :)"
25 October 2013,mpjp,1,2,8,One of the best Tarantino's,"This movie is probably the best movie of Tarantino that has ever been made. In the movie are good and well known actors like John Travolta. Also its not really a comedy but there are some really fun moments like,SPOILER ALERT, when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are in the car with 'Marvin' and John Travolta ""accidentally"" shoots Marvin in the face and they go to Quenten Tarantino himself (who in most of his own movies plays a role) and hire a professional to clean it al up. The story doesn't really flows in one time, but you see different fragments of the story. Overall I think this movie can stay on its fourth place, because it belongs there as a great movie."
4 November 2009,lol_zorz017,1,8,4,Did we watch the same movie here? *MANY FAT SPOILERS*,"It was OK. Nothing more than just OK. It's worse than just OK. But I'm still rating 4. Overdosing? Seen it. Nig*er? Seenit. F Word? Seen it as well.There's absolutely nothing 'shocking' or 'amazing' in this movie so it earns 8.9 stars, or 5th place on IMDb top 250.Bassicly, there are 3 (or 4) different stories, I can't really remember what's going on. Any way, in 1 episode Uma Thurman overdoses so they try to give her an adrenaline shot through her breast and boo-effin-hoo she wakes up as the needle comes through her. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD THAT MOVIES AMAZING. RATE 10 STARS RIGHT AWAY! Anyway 2nd story is about Bruce Willis killing a man (accidentally) in a boxing match and he's supposed to run away with his rather annoying french girlfriend(or wife). He forgets his father's watch in his old apartment so he goes to get it. Oh shoot, 'gangsters' should be watching out for him. So yeah, he goes home, picks up the watch, shoots Travolta in the face and drives back to his lady friend. Oh shoot, a gangster finds him while he's waiting for the green light and he crashes him, his girlfriends HONDA and the big fat gangster. He fights with the guy, walks into a shop. Gets knocked out, tied in a basement to a chair, and the black fat guy gets raped by the shop worker and a cop. Bruce Willis somehow releases himself, gets a katana and slices Zed like a slice of bread. Black guy gets his revenge and he pops a cap in the cops stomach with a shotgun. He doesn't die either, he's just experiencing many tummy aches. HOLY POTATO THAT WAS SOMETHING! 3rd story is about Travolta and Sam L Jackson accidentally shooting a guy in his face. Yeah, the car gets all dirty so they try to clean in up. Eventually they somehow meet with the guys in the restaurant from the first scene.It's just an ""OK"" movie, shouldn't be more than 6 stars. Not effin 9."

All i can say is first time I've seen this movie i was 12 (now 30 :) now i re-watched it in HD i feel i can still say it is one of the best movies i have ever seen. so original how it all comes together is great and i will say to the people that didn't like it i understand you're slow and couldn't understand it and didn't know what was going on even after it all came brilliant together and this movie has the most best quotes off all time better then any president of author speech of all time.Tarantino is clearly a brilliant screenplay writer and a director of very.\m/ considerable talent. I mean the Three urban stories told in the sensational manner of the full of hard boiled, obscene dialogue, humor and violence came together more beautiful then a lil girl hugging her father after not seeing him for a year of protecting the poppy seeds in Afghanistan from the Taliban ya dig. .. would love for him to remake this movie for the hell of it with more blood cgi swears killing and sex and From Dusk Till Dawn another movie classic up there with the ten commandments and wizard of oz in there own way Quentin Tarantino is like the bible writer of are time must be the weed cuz when im the same stuff that can cure cancer i think like a genus too ...and Quentin Tarantino is top 5 best looking actors off all time his swag is 10/10 and he didn't sell out to illuminati like george Lucas just did to nazi owner and co finder walt Disney/bin laden (laden family owns part of Disney btw"
28 April 2015,vanderwiellouis,0,0,7,"It's a good movie but it's definitely not flawless, it's far from that.","I don't think it is as good as many people think it is. I'm definitely not saying it's bad, in fact it's far from bad, but I did think that the fact that the movie's time was out of order was really unnecessary. A movie with no order in the time is supposed to make you ask a a lot of questions in the beginning. A great example of a movie like that is Tarantino s Reservoir Dogs. There were a lot of questions to be answered in the movie. The only question I asked myself in Pulp Fiction was ""Why are Jules and Vincent wearing beach clothes in the bar?"". In fact, I wouldn't even ask myself this question because it's really stupid. I thought the movie would have been just fine without the scrambled time.It has been considered that Tarantino is the king of dialog. I have to disagree. Admittedly the dialog is pretty entertaining in the first scene but overall, the dialog was pretty normal but in the scene where Vincent took Mia to a fancy restaurant, it was a boring scene to me because the dialog was just a rehash of what Vincent and Jules were talking about in the first scene. Afterwards, the unexpected dance everyone is talking about was pretty boring. I expected John Travolta to do sick moves but he just did moves anyone could mimic. What bothered me the most in this scene is the fact that Mia did coke in front of EVERYONE in the bathroom. Was it legal in the 90s? If not, its definitely a huge flaw. Overall, this scene could have been skipped.The movie is a dark comedy and there are some hilarious moments. There is one joke that was very unfunny to me. It might not be a very big deal to you but it is a big one to me. It's the moment when Captain Koons said that Butch's great grandfather stuck the watch up his ass. It is an overused and clichéd joke. I expected him to hide it somewhere else more disgusting because the movie is a dark comedy. It might have been funny in 1994 but I don't care how funny it was back then, it wasn't appealing to me.Now for something positive. There is something I really liked in the movie and that is the style of filming. it was filmed in a way where the cameras wouldn't move most of the time. This style is a personal preference of mine but I am giving it extra points for that. And who can forget the brilliant performances? Although it is unfair to me that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson got a lot more credit than Bruce Willis even though he had a much more exiting story but it's not part of the movie so don't worry about it."
18 January 2015,philip-borns,1,2,10,Great movie,"This is really a great movie. I loved this movie and it doesn't get all. It is a classic and and, from my point of view, the the best Tarantino movie. This was made for all movie lovers. An extraordinary visual adventure for the spectator. The acting is really good and the casting is amazing. There you have the two mob killers Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield. The duo John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson was the best i've ever seen. Then you have the boxer: Buuuutsch (Bruce Willis). There is also the Wolf (not the one from Wall Street) played by the wonderful Hrvey Keitel. There is also the the extraordinary Wife. Uma Thruman brings it to another one as Mia Wallace. The screenplay is really interesting because it involves three parallel stories, told to the spectator through different chapters. Sometimes you have movies known for the ONE big scene, but in this case, it is impossible to only take one, two or three scenes. The whole movie is a CLASSIC and a must-see before dying."
25 September 2015,cetuh,0,1,10,Pulp fiction is a masterpiece.,"Pulp fiction is a very interesting movie like no other. The way that it tells 2 different stories that still actually correlate together and vaguely have something to do with each other yet are still letting you know that the world doesn't just evolve around those specific main characters. The scenes are show what's really happening so well while also flipping through humor, action and serious moments. The characters also develop very well throughout the movie. Jules' change of heart on how he lives his life, Mr.Wallace on sparing Bruce Willis's character for costing him money and even Vincent rethinking his drug use after what happened with Mia Wallace. In conclusion, I believe that pulp fiction completely deserves a 10/10 rating , just due to the high quality witty dialogue and the amazing character development."
3 April 2006,will4592,0,2,10,This is without doubt the greatest movie EVER,"This movie did so much good for so many people. It saved John Travolta(it did), it showed us that Tarentino was a force to be reckoned with, it told so many young filmmakers (and old ones to) how to make a top quality movie and it was also really cool. This movie had everything gangsters, hicks who love s+m, over dosing bitches getting getting adrenaline shots, John Travolta getting killed (always a plus),top class direction, brilliantly written and perfect actors and actresses(except for one or two). Another great thing about this movie was the jokes. I mean it had jokes which were so smart ass and poked fun at the actor/ actress' past movies i.e. John Travolta ""oh no , I don't dance"". This are just some of the reasons why this is the best movie EVER"

24 September 2013,rolandoh22,1,2,7,Godd Movie!!,I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

OK, why?? coz it included many types like ""comedy, action, gangster, some adult content..loll"" well it included huge stars like john travolta and Bruce Willis and uma Thurman and samuel jakson...... the story cant be matched ... its well organized .... and well directed... i don't have to tell you the detailz ..but the way the whole cast performed this movie was very very very special.... all of them were special... the way they talk the way they act.... funny and serious and sexy sometimes.... in brief its the best movie in its genre... 10/10 for the director 9/10 for the story 10/10 for actors 10/10 for music"
11 November 2013,pathanoverfilm,1,2,10,Best film of the 90s,"This is definitely the best film of the 90s, closely followed by Seven and Fight Club. Tarantino breaks the molds of the gangster film and gives a great and at many time comedic look into the lives of two hit men. Bruce Willis also gives his best performance ever, mostly because he doesn't say much in the film. The music is just perfect, as with almost all of Tarantino's films. If you haven't watch this film, Watch it right now. I think, for me at least, the most 'drawn out' part of the film is Vince's interactions with Mia, mostly because I find myself partial to Sam Jackson. Anyways, this film is a great. Go watch it, then watch it again. Then ask yourself, ""What does Marsellus Wallace look like?"""

Quentin outdoes himself (and a whole generation of directors) once again. This guy.... I mean... This guy proves to be the man i always thought as a perfect man. i mean... Just read what i am telling. I have lost my ability to speak for God's sake.Pulp fiction is maybe the best thing that ever happened to Uma Therman, perhaps after Kill Bill.Btw since i checked the spoiler box beforehand, Travolta suffers a horrible death right after he goes n. 2 aka poop, in Bruce Willis house. Samuel Jackson abandoned him for Agents of SHIELD."

Everything with pulp fiction is perfect, there's a lot of small details in the pictures that alote of people might not think about, but if you love the film and sees it over and over again you'll found out that the film is full och small details witch turns it into something wonderful.The sceen when Jules (samuel L Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta)rides in the car talking about Europe and the going in to the apartment to collect Marsellus breifcase is probably the best sceen i know.Quentin knows how to make a really good film."

                        ",Outstanding movie!,No words to describe how I felt after watching this movie. It touches you to the core and makes you see your life from a whole different perspective. Unbelievable work of art!
25 December 2021,nikolicgordana,0,0,7,"Some good, Some bad","The movie is obviously an amazing movie I highly recommend. Most scenes I watched we're gold. For example when Vincent and Mia started dancing the moves we're better than the ones of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Second, the scene with Samuel and Travolta we're so powerful, I enjoyed every second of the duo. The pop culture references we're as Vincent described ""like an alive sculpture museum"" with Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Mamie Van Doren and even Jayne Mansfield being mentioned. Now onto the bad parts, my least favourite story out of all 4 is ""The Gold Watch"" which was just so horrible. I really didn't like the scene where the two guys we're tied up in the gunshooper's basement, mainly because of the sex slave in the scene. The next thing I hated about ""The Gold Watch"" story was that the guy (probably Mia's husband idk) was verbally, mentally and even physically abusing Mia, over a watch. The final minus of the film is that Samuel L. Jackson only appeared in the first and final scenes of the movie, basically not goving him a lot of screentime. Overall, the Quatantino classic never fails to stand out in a certain way and is a pretty good movie overall, so that is 7 stars."
19 January 2022,faded-77380,0,0,10,incredible film,"What is new to say about ""Pulp Fiction""? This skillful incendiary conceptual kitsch invigorates with something that you will never admit, even to yourself. The obvious idea that a bandit is also a person, like his own son, dangerous, but native, in the American real world with a century-old tradition of gangsterism, does not seem unhealthy, on the contrary, the human dignity of the same Travolta or Jackson seems normal, without any questions about some kind of law, only some other values.The film, in fact, is about the fact that everyone sets rules for themselves that correspond to their capabilities and fantasies. Soundtracks have become classics, phrases from the film have become universal property, and Tarantino is a cult figure. I can't wait for his next movie. And Amanda Plummer's screams at the very beginning should only be listened to in the original."
27 February 2015,ashleytkennedy,1,2,9,Pulp Fiction.,"Quentin Tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90's and ""Pulp Fiction"" is without doubt one of the best films ever made. This film also has one of the best casts ever assembled, the list of big names is endless. If you haven't seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. How it won just one Oscar I will never know, it defiantly deserved more in my opinion. If I had to describe it in one word it would be ""Cool"", From Samuel L Jackson's speech to John Travolta and Uma Thurman's dance. When all the story lines come together it is magnificent, and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star rating."
18 April 2022,phbracer,0,0,10,150+ minutes of dopamine disguised in a movie,"Pulp Fiction shows a brilliant understanding that the director and writers have for storytelling. It manipulates time to add an extra aspect of suspense and shock that flexes the film's ability to keep watchers on the edge of their seats. I, for one, was stunned when Vincent died only around half way through the movie. To my surprise (and enjoyment), the stories were not told in consecutive order. The pieces of the puzzle would come together at the end of the movie.I love any film that starts and ends at the same time. It's like poetry to me. Imagine my delight after seeing the two armed robbers in the same restaurant as Jules and Vincent during the final scene."
25 October 2008,Ballious,0,1,10,Deserves More Than Just One Oscar,"Pulp Fiction won one Oscar in 1994; rightly for it's incredible screenplay. But I reckon it should have had more.Best Director: Quentin Tarantino If Reservoir Dogs was groundbreaking in terms of directing, Pulp Fiction takes all those broken pieces of ground and pounds them into dust. QT knows how to make an effective film.Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Samuel L. Jackson Jackson's dialogue is phenomenal. Especially the scene where they assassinate Brett and his gang, where his 'Ezekial 25:17' speech compels the viewer to love and countless replays.Best Actress in a Supporting Role: Uma Thurman Such a sexy actress. She moves with flair and adds that sexy touch to the film, no matter how dumb, cocky or bitchy her character may be.Best Actor in a Leading Role: John Travolta Travolta may be a pretty guy actor, but he sure knows how to be a bad ass. His character ends up in some comically horrible situations, like every time he comes out of the toilet something bad happens, and you would swear you were watching a real life situation.Best Picture: Lawrence Bender Definitely. Whoever preferred Forrest Gump to this incredible and spellbinding film, full of cool events and spasms of violence, should pay Zed a visit in Maynard's pawn shop.I love this film."

6 February 2005,ayahav,2,7,5,Rantings of a convert...,"I had watched this film two times, and seen nothing in it but a vast display of gratuitous violence (for its own sake). After talking with two very good friends of mine, I was pretty much ordered to watch it again - which I did. For about an hour after having watched the film, I had the same feeling that I had had the previous two times. But I was determined to try and find meaning in what seemed to be a big jumble, because it was impossible that such a cult had evolved around a meaningless film.I started reading more and more critical reviews about the film, some of which contained little hints which helped my structure a basic understanding of the movie. For example, the contents of the briefcase (in connection with the code being '666' was something that I had not thought about connecting to the fact that Marsellus has a band-aid on the back of his head. Has he sold his soul to the devil? Though by myself I did not recognise a prevalent theme, I can recognise now that this film has some elements that talk about redemption. Vincent Vega, who chooses not to believe in miracles and in divine intervention - is killed, whereas the implication is that Jules is redeemed after acknowledging the miracle and also 'shepherding' the 'weak' (Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny) 'through the valley of darkness' (see Ezekiel 25.17).The viewing of this film is somewhat disturbing, and is worthless for people who are not willing to put vast amounts of effort into understanding it. I love criticising literature in this way, and I am generally able to understand basic frameworks easily, but this film was a big challenge. Unless you are willing to 'suffer' through this movie a few times, I would not suggest watching it - because it'd be a waste of your time. I have given this movie a 5/10, because though it is very masterful, it may not appeal to certain people. This view is only strengthened by the great schism of view about this film."
21 July 2009,madscientistrock,0,2,5,A Royale With Cheese,"In 1994 Quentin Tarantino released his second movie called ""Pulp Fiction"". The movie is based off of pulp comics and magazines. It tells the stories of two hit men, a boxer, a crime boss, and his wife. One obvious difference with this movie, compared to others, is the way Tarantino shows the events of his characters' story lines. So, the beginning is the middle, the middle can be the end, and the end is the beginning.The movie starts off in a coffee shop in Los Angeles and ends with this exact scene. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) are sent out by their boss (Ving Rhames) to collect a briefcase which has unknown contents. The only thing that is shown to the audience is a golden glow. They stroll in and surprise the three men eating a ""Nutritious breakfast of Big Kahuna Burgers."" Jules speaks to these men of why they are here and what they want. After killing two of the men, a gunman comes out of the bathroom unloading a clip at them. He misses and Jules and Vincent take him out. This is the point where Jules gains a new outlook on life. He believes that the gunman missed because of divine intervention. He decides to quit his job and walk the earth because of his made up assumptions of religion.The second story is about Vincent taking his boss' wife out while he is away in Florida. Mia (Uma Therman) is a cocaine addicted woman who wants to go to a vintage fifties diner. After some persuasion, she gets Vincent to go. Mia's drug addiction gets the best of her and she overdoses on Vincent's heroin. This leads up to one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.The last story is about a boxer (Bruce Willis) and a watch. This watch was passed down from his father in the Vietnam War. He takes money from the crime boss to ""Go down in the fifth."" Instead of losing he wins. When he arrives at the hotel room, his girlfriend forgets the watch back at the apartment. In a furious rage he risks his life to get it back. When he gets it, he meets the boss at an intersection. And a brawl commences.This is the theme of the movie: being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mr. Tarantino is by far the best in my opinion at creating very detailed story lines. He writes unique dialogue which binds the characters together. This is why he is my favorite director of all time, and this is my favorite movie. The way he uses time manipulation pulls the audience into the movie. Anyone watching will try and guess the time line of when the events happened. I would recommend this to any action/thriller lover."

                        ",Real Gritty Yet Smooth,"All the actors in this film are the best. They are the best because they are all driven to be the best, in a casual, yet ""f"" off kind of way. From what I gather, they don't care about the reviews, they are just that far into their characters, which makes for the best kind of film. This movie brings new light to the term cool. I give this film a 10 simply because its real, in a dog eat dog gritty way, Pulp Fiction is a movie I can play on repeat, even with the mistaken over dose scene, and blood, every time I watch it, I fall in love all over again. Real life, if real life came to your front door with a gun. From personal experience I would go into this movie with an absolutely open mind, and freshly open brew."

2 January 2015,aramisramos14,1,2,10,easily the best movie of all time read third paragraph for movie details,"for years I have been hearing about this movie pulp fiction. I would always hear about it see references to it and I'd ask people what the movie was about and none of them could explain. so years pass and I'm scrolling through Netflix I see pulp fiction and I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino for a long time and his great works from inglorious basterds to kill bill. so I start watching and from the first talk about robbing banks without robbing them and just the whole idea of it all made me wanna robs bank to without robbing it hahaha.and you realize what makes this movie is what makes every Tarentino movie and that's why I love his work, the DIALOGUE, dialogue, dialogue, dialogue. very movie is all about the plot just shoving and cramming the plot down your throat but Tarantino can make a movie on how to bake cookies and it'll be so good by diolague alone. and now I understand why people couldn't explain it, this movie really has no plot.this movie is just about 3 interconnected events not in order one about a hit-man who gets more than he bargained for when he takes his bosses wife out on a date upon his boss's request 2 about a washed up boxer who makes a deal with the said hit-man's boss to fix a fight and screws him over which hints at the honor among thieves theme later that episode and lastly the hit-man and his partner accidentally kill their informant and have to get rid of the body"

The movie contains many different stories and side plots that get you on the edge of your seat or laughing your a ss off. The movie was well written and directed by widely controversial director Quentin Tarantino, but he shows his talent here with by far the best movie he has ever made. Pulp Fiction contains many star actors, and they all do an incredible job in this comedy-crime-thriller. Bruce Willis(Butch) plays an escaping boxer, Ving Rhames(Marcellus) plays a gangster and the boss of Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman(Mia) is Ving Rhames wife who gets into a little bit of trouble with, John Travolta(Vincent) who is great as a gangster also ran by Marcellus trying to help his boss out by taking his wife out to dinner, and Samuel L. Jackson(Jules) as a religious yet psychotic gangster trying to find his path in life. All actors star in this, especially Samuel L., and this is not a movie that anyone should miss. You will get many lines, thrills, and laughs out of this violent yet intelligent film."

15 July 2013,Jay_Cui,0,0,9,Just best,"Love Uma since saw the Pulp Fiction. Saw this movie several years ago. I just watched it again! Super love one scene that her character Mia dancing with Vincent and after the dancing Vincent ""has to"" taken care of her. I then dig her others movies such as Kill Bill 1 and 2. And of course, Quentin is a great director & writer who makes this movie worthy to watch multiple times.In the movie, there is a so-called 'loop' existed, linking all characters together. I think, back at that time, it is a great movie making strategy, although it will make you out of clues at the beginning. It is also said that Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style.I think the main thread in this movie is the death of Vincent. Given his soft personality, his ways handling missions, his careless, he is doomed to die.Great movie! I give 9 because there are still some un-logistic scenes existed."

It is like Comedy & Thriller less to say about Crime. I would just rate this an 8 or an 8.5. I really enjoyed this movie anyway Especially that scene at 1:53:10 where that guy comes with a gun and shoots John Travolta (Vincent Vega)& Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield)and they don't get a scratch.Isn't that a SERIOUS COMEDY ? It is an Extremely Amazingly original and unforgettable movie. Anyway, the story -Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight.

29 August 2012,hectorsteeves,0,1,10,Quentin Tarantino's flawless accomplishment,"Quentin Tarantino has done the impossible and, through the excess of violence and the use captivating dialog, took an improbable idea and executed it flawlessly. Following absolutely no movie format or script guideline, Quentin delivers a powerful film that will forever be engraved in pop culture. The irony behind it, however, is that the movie is a satire of pop culture itself. Quentin manages to make extreme violence and two menacing hired killers both humorous and enjoyable. How? The key lies in the dialog. For example, when Vincent -one of the killers- was driving with Jules and unnecessarily shoots the black man that was in the back seat of the car, blood and brain parts splatter everywhere. What does the audience do? Laugh. A combination of John Travolta's indifferent, yet humorous attitude accentuated by his line of ""Aww man, I shot Marvin in the face."" and Samuel Jackson's loud reaction with ""WHY'D YOU SHOOT MARVIN IN THE FACE?"" completely makes the audience feel no empathy for the deceased man. The dialog shifts their focus of attention from the murder and simply makes the whole situation laughable. Genius. Note, this was achieved also by the perfect acting performance from both actors. This is why I loved this movie. On top of that it has an all star crew. John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman -excellent cast performance!"
8 April 2005,the_godfather1990,0,2,9,The Beginning of Modern Gangster Films,"Quentin Tarantino shows us that gangsters don't talk about gangsters all the time. And it's true, they don't. I believe he is the first director to accurately portray this. This is one of my favorites because of the great acting, brilliant dialog, and adequate fight sequences.The movie begins with two characters named Honeybunny and Pumpkin sitting at a booth in what looks to be a diner. The two begin to talk about how everybody robs banks and that nobody robs diners. They decide they should be the first, so they stand up on their table and scream, ""This is a holdup!"" The frame freezes and credits roll.This movie jumps between three different stories...about one story. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are two hit-man whose acting performances are Oscar worthy. Bruce Willis plays Butch, a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for mob boss Marcellus. Marcellus is Travolta and Jackson's mob boss.The opening sequence is a clip from the third story in the film. After the credits roll the movie goes to a story where John Travolta's character ""Vincent"" and Jackson's character ""Jules"" go kill a couple people who stole Marcellus's briefcase containing something very important. This first story also coincides with Vincent taking out Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) out to dinner.The second story is about how Butch is supposed to throw a fight but refuses so Marcellus sends Vincent and Jules out to kill him. Butch is nearly home free to leave but he left his father's prized gold watch back at his apartment. He goes back to retrieve it and a surprise was awaiting him...Third and final story is about what the opening sequence expect now you see that Vincent and Butch are eating at the diner. When they are holding the place up, Jules convinces them to give him his wallet back in a humorous cocky way. Vincent and Jules leave the restaurant like they own the world as the credits begin to roll up.My two favorite things about this movie is the dialog and the great music. I hope you enjoyed this review."
6 February 2005,Rorhen_Cast,1,3,10,Three stories... About one story... All I can say is... cool,"Personal Critique: three plus out of four stars Many people consider this movie to be over rated and I did at first, but after careful consideration and looking at this movie better, I saw I was wrong. This is probably one of the most close-to-reality there is (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS).The Dialogue: probably the most real dialogue ever. The way the characters talk is so real and annunciated, not properly but the way people really say it which makes it likable, smart, and cool.The Stories: Perhaps the most common stories and genres re-told in the coolest of ways. And the way the story was told was unique and cool. They (the stories) told so much about the characters. Each one had focused on certain ones and put them in situations that showed what a person would really do in reality.The Characters: All there is to say is cool. Vincent Vega was in my opinion, John Travolta's best performance ever. The dance scene with him and Mia (Uma Thurman) was one of the coolest scenes in any movie I've ever seen. And Mia's overdose scene is the biggest and most memorable scene of the movie ever. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules is as cool as Vincent. His Ezekiel speech is one of the best speeches I've heard and his character is cool and calm, controlling the situations in the best of manners. When he was talking to Ringo and Yolanda, trying to calm them down, you think ""God this guy is good"".Pulp Fiction is easily one of my favorite movies and is part of the top five movies."

The way in which different stories curl into one another is extremely fascinating. The various flashbacks that support the story are an important added value. Surprising but also extremely good typecasting.It's one of THE cult films of the 90s. You must have just seen this film. It does not matter whether you liked him or not.It's just cinematic tripping. The conversations, monologues, settings, clothes.

When the credits hit the screen at the end of this movie a certain feeling rises in my throat. Unlike some other of my favorite movies, where I look at the world around me differently for a few hours, at the end of Pulp Fiction I'm simply struck by a feeling of ""Whoa, that was cool."" This movie could be called genius and I would agree. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and this was the first movie of his I saw and I have to admit that almost at first when I was watching it I felt that sort of ADD that I feel if I'm watching an okay movie. I was squirming around until the first shot was fired and then I sat for the next hour or so and was stunned. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST go out right now to your local video store and rent Pulp Fiction. It will change you, and you may find that you have a new favorite movie."

Tarantino who has been critiqued badly because of the fact that his movies have to much violence has obviously not been cricted correctly and his movies have not been watched correctly. this movie had put cinema at the highest point, the thing about is it doesn't have any special effects to keep his audience engulfed, violence( which is done so beautifully with cinema-tics of it's own and pop-culture keeps you there by itself. its my favorite MOVIE, AND IT MAY JUST BE MIRAMAX'S FAVORITE TO."

Priceless performance from there on from Willis. The screenplay was also fantastic , following a day in the life of such complex but wonderful characters who's paths cross and fate could be held in one another's hands.

18 July 2014,dmaturo1996,0,1,10,Absolutely incredible,As I write this I have a poster for this film next to me! I have deemed it my favorite movie and Tarantino my favorite director/writer quite a while ago. Pulp Fiction truly show Tarantino's passion for film in it's many homages and in the form of Jack Rabbit Slim's which I can only assume for a fellow movie lover like Tarantino was a dream set. The whole film continues to show Tarantino's always great dialogue all around. This alongside his other films is heavily dialogue driven which when done well can make for a great movie experience. The actor's performances are incredible each actor uses the dialogue their given to create great characters that everyone knows especially in Samuel L. Jackson who delivers a great speech in the form of EZEKIAL 25:17. This is a segway to another large component of Tarantino films: Violence because after this speech they unload on a man who betrayed their boss. So a little disclaimer if your not one who can watch violence in a movie then I might avoid this. The music chosen for the soundtrack is great. I cut myself off here because I could go on for hours with praise for this film Needless to say I highly recommend this film to anyone who has not yet seen it. Then go watch his other films.

                        ",A World of Mystery,"Pulp Fiction is a movie I have watched over and over again throughout the course of my life. The first time I saw it I was 16 and I had never really seen a movie that contained an artistic sentiment to it. Up to that point my favorite movies were ones like Wayne's World, or Young Frankenstein. Then I found the Pulp Fiction VHS in a thrift store and thought I would give it a whirl. ""Zeds dead baby, Zeds dead"". That is the true end of the movie. It would probably take me watching it five times to finally realize that though. For the first time in my life I was watching a movie that contained critical thinking. It wasn't linear, and not only that but everything was so intense! But we all know about the movie. I think the greatest thing about this film isn't necessarily the placement of scenes etc, but instead the mystery element revolving around it.My main focus when looking back to the movie is figuring out what was in the briefcase. Was it Wallace's soul? What happened when Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta killed the guys in the apartment and light started flashing?Tarantino made a world full of questions. A parallel universe that, despite close to ours, isn't. That is the genius behind this film and I recommend those who have seen it once or twice to go back and what it again... see what else you find."
6 June 2005,AngelEyesAndBulletTeeth,0,2,10,A top 10 of mine,"Can a finished piece of cinema get any better than this when you consider the story, the cast, the crew, and all the other aspects? It's hard and only a few in my opinion have done it. Tarantino is masterful as always with his big screen directed sophomore effort.The movie is an action packed, humorous, and at sometimes disturbing group of scenes all mixed up in non chronological order for your blissful movie experience. A must see and a must own. Jackson, Travolta, Willis, and Thurman put on some of their best acting performances here. There isn't much more to say than this is a one of a kind classic film."
19 September 2016,idohadar,1,2,6,"A heartless movie, as special","Pulp Fiction is an interesting movie. Pulp fiction is not an excellent movie. It is completely average. But what makes people think it is so good?The movie begins with a conversation of two people talking about robberies, and then deciding to rob the same restaurant they are in. The Dialogue, as in every Tarantino movie, is clever and sharp. But as (I hope) we know, clever and sharp dialogue doesn't guarantee a good movie, as a dialogue just doesn't have to be clever and sharp after all. In fact, I think that by Tarantino's style of writing, abducts different kind of character developments, by making them as a cardboard typecast, with a little bit of their own story characteristics.And that really is my problem with Pulp fiction. The characters are not full. The characters can be smart as they are, but they are not full. all we get here is people who say smart things with cool typecast and environment. When Jules and Vincent for example, talk about burgers in France, you can't not notice the lack of feelings and states of mind they do not have. So they talk and you listen, and you get blended in with their style and intelligence, but never anyhow feel the characters appliance on true emotions and true values' cinema,as with life at all. Talking about the plot, As with Tarantino non linear story-line, he manages to hide the film's lack of interesting plot and instead making scenes which completely does not not relate cinematically to each other. Even with holding the non linear story line. Talking about the scenes themselves separately (Which is always not a good way of talking about a movie), the scenes themselves are full of surprises and other cinematic values like tension who blend really well in this un plotted movie. Saying that, if the movie had a different cinematic state, stronger emotions and real life setting' which hover beyond the lameness (That's the word) and Norma of films like that, I'm pretty sure the tension and cinematic values will just not fit in. AND TO SUMMARIZE!Pulp Fiction is a nice film to watch if you love normal cinema. a cinema which doesn't discuss different states by its nature and nature by its state. If you like technical cinema, definitely go watch it. You will learn a lot. Although, if you want to see real cinema, which tells a story, with empowered deepness characters and real values of the existence of people's life, go see almost any other movie, bad or good."

23 April 2018,kkarkar-68283,0,1,10,Masterpiece,Any Tarantino film automatically becomes my favorite film. Tarantino has such an interest form of story telling that is both capturing and confusing.

26 August 2018,mohammad-22400,0,0,8,Weirdly Good Message,"1994 had good movies in it but this movie is nonetheless one of the best. it includes dirty businesses, racial slurs and drugs but in the bigger picture it holds a great heart touching message. the movie have weird timelines but in the end every thing clicks to a full circle which makes you wonder after watching it for awhile."
17 January 2015,glancyj18,1,3,10,Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,"The Shawshank Redemption had been number one on my list for a long time, but after I watched Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption finally got bumped down to number two. My friend and I watched this surprisingly funny movie and laughed through the entire thing, especially at Tarantino's witty use of dialogue (Ezekial 25:17 (not a real passage, by the way), royale with cheese, jack rabbit slims, and coffee). Tarantino has often been criticized for using too much violence, but he presents the violence in such a way that it is artistic and not as brutal as it would be in real life (for another example of this, see Kill Bill Vol. 1). This is ever present in this movie, his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. Without further ado, here are some pros of the movie.Pros: -The unchronological story, it actually makes you think a little. You now have to pay attention to the finer details-The style, cinematography, and the fantastic soundtrack (Dick Dale, just like every Tarantino film-Samuel L. Jackson plays one of the finest roles in his career to date, jheri curl and all-Can be an ""art film"" along with a ""just for entertainment film""-Tarantino's cameo role as Jimmy-Pop culture references In summary, this movie is funny, witty, full of pop culture, artsy yet entertaining, has a great soundtrack, and uses violence to its advantage."
17 January 2019,kennethlach,0,1,9,Pulp Fiction,"Cheap and Wet Fiction with some Pulp
A must see movie with multiple award, Pulp Fiction is a dramatic crime movie with many humorous scenes known for its many iconic scenes and well known faces that anyone would know of regardless of age.
The movie begins in the city of Los Angeles at a small diner joint called Hawthorne's Grill, a couple having a nice breakfast in the morning soon turns sour when the couple decides to rob the breakfast joint. The scene soon fades out and another scene comes up, two hit men are having small discussions with each other about various things such as the name of foods and suddenly changing the topic to when is it ok to murder someone they even discuss about the legality of drugs in other parts of the world . A few more scenes are shown to us after these first two, a lady surviving a near death experience, two dudes pulling up to a bar in only t-shirts and boxer shorts, a boxer on the run after breaking a deal, and even a man waking up to a car pulled up with blood all over and, all of these moments manage to link together like cogs being turn.
Quentin Tarantino's use of different of multiple points of view and tying everything together at the end a step at a time helps movie watchers finally know the whole story of the movie while keeping them in the dark as to why the movie plays out with different moments with no certain order. Despite how well the scenes were done and played by the actors, the little amount of development of the characters and the missed opportunities of the scenes shows that the movie is lacking although I still enjoyed it for many other things.
Tarantino's choice of actors to fulfill the portrayal of characters in the movie like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta as the two hit men Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, Tarantino is able to utilize their acting ability to their full potential that one of their scenes becomes a very memorable moment in movie history that the scene is used on many things outside of the movie genre like shirts, posters and even memes. I've seen many shirts that combined the members of the band Daft Punk replacing Vincent and Jules as they hold up their pistols as they were about to fire, even recently a meme became popular that was a reference to Samuel L. Jackson scene as he is about to see Quentin Tarantino's character, he says; ""S**t N***o, that's all you had to say. Speaking of characters I find it enjoyable when movie producers include themselves in the movie either as primary or secondary roles, or even cameos like Stan Lee's many cameos in his own movies like in his most recent movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, leaves me satisfied. Seeing Tarantino have a role in his own movie tells me I will like the movie a lot. If there is something I find lacking for the movie would be the amount of time characters have, I really like seeing character development in a movie and although the acting in Pulp Fiction was amazing I was sad that I wouldn't see anymore of the character or what will happen to the character at the end of the movie.
Another key strength of the movie would be music and editing, the music used in certain parts of the film plays a big part in the movie, the scene with Vincent and Jules at the apartment goes very well with the moment that people are remembered of this scene from the movie when they hear it from somewhere else that isn't they movie, the music also goes well with dance scenes, the one scene where Travolta's character and Uma Thurman's character begin dancing I think the music had a part in making the now iconic dance scene very noteworthy and well known, music plays a more supportive role in movies because it can manipulate the emotion of the audience. The editing of the movie is another supportive part of movies, although the editing wasn't realistic, the cheesiness of the editing can give the movie humorous moments, like when the gun was fired and the car was splattered with blood, combine this and the panicking of both Vincent and Jules you can get a pretty funny scene from the movie. One thing I wish the movie included were extra scenes that explained some moments in the movie that left me wanting answers like the many scenes with the suitcase, I will never know what was inside the case unless I searched it online of watch a video and honestly I wouldn't want to do that to myself.
Pulp fiction is a movie you definitely want to watch when you are old enough since the movie is rated R and even if you do watch it at a younger age you may not get the humor of Tarantino. After watching this movie you will get the many references to the movie whether you see them on the internet, on shirts or if you're just walking through the store because this movie will be marked as one of the best movies of its time and I think it is deserving of its many awards."
2 April 2008,Cylon_Crichton,1,2,8,Cinematic Brilliance,"Pulp Fiction, an Academy-Award winning film by Quentin Tarantino, became an instant favorite of mine. The plot focuses on the intersecting lives of several people in unique and unusual tough situations, from a hit man who decides to leave the business to a fighter who wants to keep his honor. From shootings to normal conversations to drugs and back to casual conversations, the film does a superb job of tying the viewer to the characters by making them average people you could see yourself hanging out with, despite their extreme situations and sometimes shocking actions.I, personally, could really enjoy a movie made up of nothing but conversations if they were written well enough, as I'm constantly amused by debating issues with friends and random facts. Though this film had much action and plot, it also had those regular situations that grounded it all, like conversations about what cheeseburgers are called in foreign countries and whether or not a foot massage is too intimate. To me, these kinds of things are the most important in a film like this. Tarantino is masterful and humanizing everyone in his films, causing you to identify with them and care for their fate. This is what makes you really care when the action starts.A diner is robbed. A young woman very nearly dies from a drug overdose. A man's head is accidentally shot to pieces in the back of a car in broad daylight. These are just a few of the situations in Pulp Fiction that have your heart racing, hoping the carefully crafted characters can make their way out of. The action was all done very well, each conflict scripted in a way that made each scene uniquely interesting, occasionally disturbing, and wonderful. Another thing that Tarantino's films do well is to give each random side character that gets involved their own life, so that the audience gets the definite feeling that the snapshot we get of their lives isn't the whole of the filmmaker's creation, but rather a window into something more vast.Overall, I have only good words for this movie. I loved the looped time line. The characters were focused upon highly without the action or drama lacking at all. Everything was well written, be it the odd conversation about a TV pilot or even conversations themselves, or a foiled assassination. I'm certainly looking forward to my second viewing of this amazing film."

                        ",It does have a plot,"The plot is seen more easily if one watches Pulp Fiction in chronological order.  Also {SPOILER} Jules gets out of the business, and he is the main protagonist, so it can be said to not be in support of violence, but then again that might just be a justification from someone who likes the movie."
28 September 2013,phantomolivera,1,3,10,This movie is in a word exciting must see!!!!,"""Pulp Fiction""Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term ""pulp fiction"" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap ""pulp"" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof)."
8 February 2018,kmancrazy,1,2,8,Timeless Style,"Pulp Fiction's mise en scene weaves uber-classical Big Hollywood set design with lackadaisical realism. Jack Rabbit Slim's, the retro diner with the $5 milkshakes, is an ode to the grandiose production quality of older films that treated the screen as a stage. Tarantino seems to purposefully date his film by basking in the old rules of cinema. Film noir, for example, makes an appearance when Butch is in the backseat of a taxi after unintentionally killing his boxing opponent. Everything from the smoking cigar in his teeth, to his stiffly squinted eyes, to the directionally shaded light, screams of the archetypal crime drama. Yet there are these deeply personal sequences in which the camera takes on an amatuer role. As Butch limps away from Wallace, we follow him through a handheld, shaky frame that seems to trip and fall each time one of them does. It harkens back to Tarantino's early original, My Best Friend's Birthday, in the way it is juvenile yet action-seeking. Nonetheless, it's interesting. And there's something about its craft that manages to drag you into a world that is totally over-the-top.
 A large part of what is so captivating about this film is its sense of a closed frame. Tarantino is gratuitous with the facial close-up, drawing out sweat like a stroke of a paintbrush and allowing us intimate views of each character's scars (both literally and symbolically). While Butch converses with Wallace toward the beginning of the movie, we see him trapped in the frame behind the shoulder of a man who has been beat and will always recover, as indicated by the Band-Aid on the back of his head. This film is, after all, a character piece first and an action film second. Every character has to watch their back in some way, like Butch in his claustrophobic hotel room and the poor soul that Samuel L Jackson puts a startling end to. 
 Tarantino doesn't do anything particularly ""new-age"" with his directing, instead paying homage to the techniques of classic samurai films and the like. The moment the adrenaline needle plunges into Mia's heart with a pop, the camera jolts to her wide eyes and then cuts back to a neutral shot as she awakens in a frenzy. It's reminiscent of a sequence in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho from 1960, following the simple pattern of an attack, the victim's facial surprise, and then the ensuing reaction. In this sense, Pulp Fiction achieves the perfect balance of extending on, but not copying, the greatest techniques in the history of cinema.
 Yet, with the film's style made timeless by all these technical approaches, there are some uses of the medium that transform the viewing experience. As Butch dances stealthily back to his apartment to retrieve his father's precious watch, the camera floats inexplicably behind him, appearing to pass straight through a fence. It's an impossible view that gives us an omniscient perspective of the impending danger. Or consider the extreme low-angles we get from the trunk of Vincent Vega's car or during his cocaine purchase -- the frame is placed in a location that evokes the feeling of watching secretly from a hidden spot. We are seeing something we're not supposed to see. This angle isn't used in the typical context to give an actor ominous power, and this is how the film gets its unique tone from sort of shrugging off the savage nature of the character duo.
 Pulp Fiction shows that Tarantino is best at creating situations. The camera is merely pointed where to look, occasionally hesitating on a mesmerizing visual element to enhance the aesthetic of the situation. It is unconventional in that it leans into the realist components of the lives of screen villains, and that is why its combination of classic tricks with personal style is ultimately cohesive. Although the film appears to be a product of the story, a consistent dedication to style is the key to Tarantino's creation of a captivating, fresh bit of cinema."
15 November 2015,sisman_yunus,2,8,7,Overrated,"The story is told of a crusty Midwestern newspaper editor who returned to work after a vacation and threw a fit. His prize headline type, enormous letters he'd been holding back for years for a truly big event, were used in his absence on a story detailing serious tornado damage. ""You young fool,"" he snapped at the offending party, ""I was saving that type for the Second Coming.""From the moment it hit the screen at Cannes, even before it was awarded that festival's celebrated Palme d'Or, ""Pulp Fiction"" and its writer- director Quentin Tarantino have been given the big-type, Second Coming treatment, drenching them in the kind of media awe and appreciation reserved for paradigms of cinematic accomplishment.It's an overrated movie.

18 October 2016,bonnach,0,0,10,Original Storytelling + Tarantino's Best,"Almost every serious cinephile has seen this masterpiece of neo-noir by now. I love how this film nods to classic noir, but takes it beyond the pale into the present, or the present as it was in the 90s. Everyone thinks about the main thread of Jules and Vincent, but the true noir factor is the whole Bruce Willis thread as the palooka who turns the tables on the fight fixers and gets away with it, though not without suffering his just dues by the hand of Zed and the Gimp. Every character brings something important to the show, no matter how short and seemingly insignificant their role. Some of the best lines are spoken by waiters and waitresses. And bringing the Gimp out of the box in the finale is just like the cherry on top. Who saw that coming? The negatives? Well, as with all Tarantino films, the script is a bit talky. I'd like to see one of his films with minimal dialogue in the future. His latest efforts are waaaay too wordy. I get what he's doing, but god, just get on with the story already. Anyway... Pulp Fiction has just groundbreaking editing, acting and classic storytelling all around. You can tell how influential it was by how many imitators were slapped together in the decade after if was released. It is the template that all of his subsequent films should been crafted from."

I can see the movie critics with phd's in 'film studies' crying out 'it start where it begun, THE GENIUS!' but in all honestly this film has a delivers a similar viewing experience as listening to the first lord of the rings book on shuffle gives.-Long -Slow -Boring -Nothing really happens"

16 January 2019,pboangiu,1,2,10,The best,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured."

19 May 2014,RyJaBr,2,10,2,Pointless,"I just recently saw this movie for the first time, and at the end I was thinking ""That's it?"" The movie is supposed to be about 3 or 4 different story lines told out of order that interweave with one another. Only, they don't interweave. Lumping these stories together in one film is pointless. What ""interweaves"" between the stories are a few characters, which could easily be replaced by random new made up characters. Literally nothing that happens in any of these story lines has any effect on the other story lines. This movie has good elements. Telling a movie out of sequence isn't a bad idea, nor is regular dialogue, or language or violence. But none of these things are used in this movie to help tell a story. They're just there for the sake of being there, which makes this a terrible film. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters in this movie. The entire chapter of Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega was boring pointless nothingness. The Gold Watch actually had a plot, although Vincent Vega randomly gets shot to death. You literally could have put any random hit-man in that bathroom and it wouldn't have changed a thing. The one dude in the Bonnie Situation isn't killed in the apartment just so Vincent and Jules have something to do before breakfast where the robbers are, the only place in the entire movie where there is any real connect between any of the story lines. This entire circus is built off of violence and drawn-out dialogue which is not enough to make a movie."

This is a film everyone who likes film needs to watch! My favorite scene is when Samuel Jackson and John Travolta walks through a hallway of a Motel. The Dialog is absolutely amazing.

Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected.

If this was written by a regular scriptwriter it would be like: he gets a watch, it's very special to him because it was his grandfather and father watch. But Quentin Tarantino made this so much more enjoyable. In pulp fiction this wasn't just a watch but a watch that was carried 3 years in different asses so Vietnam soldiers wouldn't steal if there were dead.This is one of the examples why Quentin Tarantino is one of the best scriptwriters of all time."

I was a little suprised, yet satisfied. I like movies that end without a real resolution but rarely do the ones I choose to watch. Those are the movies that feel more real, more interesting.

24 October 2007,roshan123,0,1,9,The coolest film of all time!!!,"I have to say that after watching Pulp Fiction for the first time I was utterly blown away. Tarantino does a masterful job here in what I believe is his finest bit of work. The script is almost flawless, flowing exceptionally well throughout the movie. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue between Jackson and Travolta, with reference to arguments about the so called 'miracle' which takes place as in one scene when they are shot at close range but neither one is hit. Jackson is awesome as Jules, possibly one of the coolest characters of all time, excellently portraying the idea of redemption, which is a key theme throughout the movie, as he is in transition from 'bad man killer' to the rejuvanated good guy. Travolta puts in an excellent performance,as does Ving Rhames as Marsellus, who is the 'big bad boss' but even he, as ruthless as he is, experiences redemption as he forgives Willis,who does not throw the boxing match for him. I think the ending is brilliant leaving the viewers with an immense sense of 'cool' as Jackson deals with a potentially dangerous and violent situation in an uncharacteristically non violent way. All in all this movie is a must watch for anyone, and is certainly a testament to the genius that Tarantino is."

Marcellus pays Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to put on a boxing match. Vincent is assigned to entertain the female boss, Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big break. I saw it in the theater and maybe even before Tank Dogs. I had definitely seen True Romance before this movie, but I didn't know who to praise for the dialogue in this movie until I put two and two together. It's a cinematic explosion. Many have tried to copy his style, but no one has surpassed him. It's super cool. It has the timing confusion that gives the film so much charm. Again, many films try to copy it, but only a few succeed. This is one of the iconic films of the 90s."
19 January 2022,sofmalysh,0,0,10,I've heard a lot about this movie and many times I wanted to watch it,"I've heard a lot about this movie and many times I wanted to watch it, you know, you want to watch a movie and even say to yourself, well, I'll watch this movie, but now you have free time, but as for evil, you don't know what to watch. Well, we digress from the topic.First, about the cast and director:
Director, screenwriter - Quentin Tarantino. I think it's a famous name. Considering that it was for the script for this film that he won an Oscar.John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman - it also seems to me quite famous names.Well, now about the plot itself, what you actually started reading this article \ review for. (Of course, I don't have much experience in writing such articles and maybe I took too complex a work, but I'll try) :)
The film captures and does not let go. You don't notice how two and a half hours pass. The characters, their images, dialogues, everything is thought out to the smallest detail. Still, Quentin is a genius and a great professional in his field, he not only wrote the scripts, but also shot them no less brilliantly. In this film, the genres of thriller, drama, crime thriller, comedy, and even a love drama are skillfully intertwined. And even scenes with excessive cruelty are perceived somehow differently, easily. In the film, various social social topics are raised, well, for example, the hero of Samuel L. Jackson (perhaps he wrote in the wrong declension, I beg your pardon) is thinking and talking about religion. Still, this movie would be just a crime thriller of which there are a lot, but dialogues are something!... Well, now it's not about that, maybe I'll somehow devote a separate article to this.In general, I think everyone needs to watch this film, everyone will find something of their own in it. The film has not lost its relevance to this day, although almost 19 and a half years have passed (the premiere took place on May 12, 1994). Well now it's not about that maybe how-"
19 January 2022,pexinik,0,0,9,Hikolai,"In my opinion, this film is quite interesting and ambiguous. The topic of human vices is partially revealed. This movie runs for about 2.5 hours, but during the viewing this time is not noticed. Director Torantino is, in principle, famous for his unusual presentation. I was very surprised when I found out that such a famous person in the field of cinema has no directorial education!"
19 December 2007,madcow39526,0,1,9,"An artful, hilarious, memorable, thrilling, all around great movie.","This was an absolutely amazing film. Yes I call it a film, not a movie. This is more a work of genius than it is a simple movie.The dialog in this film is amazing. If you haven't seen it, then you have at least heard some of the memorable quotes. ""Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead."" ""That's thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten."", the Amsterdam quote, the personality quote, and many many more that I can't post in this comment because of language.The music is astounding. I actually went out and bought the soundtrack, which has songs ranging from ""Misirlou"" by D*ck (edited for prohibited word) Dale, to ""Lets Stay Together"" by Al Green.And finally on to the acting. Tarantino had his usual cameo, which he nailed. Travolta and Samuel L. put on an amazing performance in their respective parts, and Uma Thurman had a great roll."
25 May 2022,Dongtrunghathaodkmgroup,0,1,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" very good","One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured."
5 October 2008,Rhys28,0,1,10,The Masterpiece,"This movie really is a masterpiece and is tied for the best movie I have ever seen with The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is not for everyone because of violence, swearing and a male rape scene but I think every adult could enjoy this movie. The scripting is brilliant, the acting is brilliant and the plot is amazing how 3 stories can all intertwine with, and affect each other and be so interesting. The 3 stories are made amazing because something goes wrong in all 3 of them, which forces another situation, which creates brilliant stories and a brilliant movie. All the performances were top-notch but Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) was incredible.Tarantino is a genius to create such a film. The way it manages to be light-hearted in some very serious moments, the way the dialogue is so interesting, the way the music fits the scenes perfectly and the way movie unfolds right until the very end which is so good because in many movies you know roughly what to expect within the first 25 minutes.I know this has been said before but Pulp Fiction and Shawshank should have won more Oscars. Pulp Fiction won 1 , Shawshank won 0 and Forest Gump 6. Most alarming, Forest Gump won best picture and that definitely should have gone to Pulp or Shawshank.This movie doesn't have a message or a motive, it does not need one, it tells a great story and is highly entertaining. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece."
19 August 2009,krbsong3,0,1,9,Awesome Flick,"Pulp Fiction has to be one of the greatest movies of its time. Quinton Tarantino works wonders with this one, but then again, how could you go wrong with this cast? The dialogue between characters Jules and Vincent is well thought out enough to be brilliant and yet seems so ordinary; it makes two killer gangsters look like they could be any other ordinary guy on the street. It is not only the dialogue that makes this movie, it is the transition of scenes and events. The audience is forced to keep up, to think, and keeps them wondering, ""what's next?"" The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together through such strange and outlandish events making the movie intriguing, funny, unique, and intense. It's among the best films made in the past twenty years."
4 March 2014,stevenpenrodjr-655-880381,0,0,10,Great Flick!,"This movie has got to be one of the craziest films ever made. Including the all-star cast & the different story lines, how it all comes together in the end (so to speak) is brilliant.First time I seen this I didn't know what I was in for but glad I did. Tarantino at his original best is still around the time this film was made. 5 Stars QT! This is by far one of his best works!Now, let's just hope that Mr. Willis doesn't want to do a 2nd part to this ... that would be just scary. Don't know hoe we'd be able to handle a all new version, remake or sequel:""Zed's Dead Baby ... wait no, he's back as a Zombie!"":-)"
2 February 2011,fonzi01,0,1,10,A Classic,"Pulp Fiction is the excellent work of director Quentin Tarantino. The story and overall theme consists of four separate stories that are following the different characters through their interactions with one another in a non-chronological manner. The first story consists of gangster hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). The second story is with Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), who is Vincent and Jules' boss, and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). The third story follows a boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). The final storyline is with Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) and Ringo (Tim Roth), which bookends the movie making its appearance at the beginning and end of the film. Tarantino utilized a similar style of story in Reservoir Dogs, starting the movie at a point that was brought back into focus much later in the film.The story starts with Yolanda (also known as Honey Bunny) and Ringo (also known as Pumpkin) discussing the finer points of how robbing liquor stores business is getting to be too risky of a business at a coffee shop. They decide they now would be a great time to rob that coffee shop as they saw it to be easy money. This will play a large role later in the movie.Then you are introduced to Vincent and Jules. They are hit men working for Marsellus. You get to see into to their gangster lifestyle. As with the execution style murder they commit to retrieve a briefcase of Marcellus'. First hand, you get the see the angle of the murder like you were sitting in the room with them. A man unbeknown to Vincent and Jules pops out of a bedroom and fires shots at Vincent and Jules from point blank but they all miss. Jules looks on this as being a miracle and says he's a changed man and wants to reform his life. However, the next task that Vincent is assigned is one he's not familiar with. Vincent has been asked by Marcellus' request to show his wife a good time while Marcellus is out on business. This leads into the next storyline with Vincent and Mia Wallace.Vincent accompanies Mia on a dinner where they enjoy themselves over getting to know you talk and then ultimately Vincent drives Mia home. As Vincent goes inside the Wallace residence to use the restroom, Mia gets what she thinks is a bag of cocaine out of Vincent's jacket and helps herself to a line of it. This turns out to be a nearly fatal error as what she snorted ended up being ""the mad man"" heroin he had just purchased earlier in the day. He is able to save her life by rushing her to a friends house and administering an adrenaline shot that once again makes you think that you are in the room with them at the time its happening.After this sequence Butch is introduced. When you meet him he is telling Marcellus Wallace that ""in the 5th he is going down"", taking a dive as they say in boxing. However, Butch does not make good in his promise to Marcellus and ends up killing the other boxer in the ring. He plans on making off with Marcellus' money and fleeing.The best aspect of the movie is how these almost separate stories are sewn together are tied together by smart storytelling. Vincent and Jules are on their way to do a job for Marcellus to retrieve his bag. At this job they have an informant that is waiting there for them. After the job is done they take this man (Marvin) back to his side of town, but along the way while asking Marvin a question Vincent's gun accidentally fires off completely blowing away Marvin's head in the car. They take the car to a safe house to clean it out. To rid themselves of their bloody clothes, the man who owns the safe house (Jimmie) gives them very uncharacteristic, beach attire to wear. You see them earlier on in the movie in these clothes but you don't know why yet. After they get the car situation with Marvin's blood all over it resolved, they stop to pick up breakfast. They go to breakfast at the same place where Yolanda and Ringo are planning to hold up at the beginning of the movie. The closing sequence is Jules talking Ringo down from holding up to the store and ultimately letting Ringo go as he said he can change his ways just as Jules has proclaimed he has changed his. Then later on days later after a few days after the Butch kills the man in the ring and tries to make off with the money. Vincent is waiting for him in his apartment. However at the time that Butch comes home Vincent is in the bathroom, Butch sees Vincent's gun on the counter and ends up shooting Vincent.The movie makes great strides to tell you story of the characters involved. Tarantino's style of character building is excellent in this film. The first time you see the movie you might not quite understand where the story is going, but you will realize the genius of the movie by the time you are through watching it."
6 February 2011,klfishyklfishy,0,1,10,How our actions affect our lives,"The theme of Pulp Fiction is how our lives interact with others and how the decisions we make now affect our lives. John Travolta (Vincent Vega), Samuel Jackson (Jules), Bruce Willis (Butch), and Uma Thurman (Mrs. Mia Wallace) are the four main characters in this movie. All their lives are somehow entwined with one another and are affected by decisions they make, by themselves or one of the other characters. This movie is different from other movies because it contains mini-movies rather than one movie as a whole.Each mini-movie contains its' own plot that centers on the theme of the movie. It helps explain how the characters know each other and how the events that happen in their lives mix with the other characters lives. The first story revolves around a couple low-life robbers', the second is two hit men's lives, and finally a boxers life. All the stories are broken up and in random order, which was part of the movie's unique characteristic.Vincent and Jules are two hit men in search of their boss' briefcase. In the course of their travels they interact superbly with one another. Samuel Jackson, who plays Jules, does a wonderful job of getting into character. Bruce Willis plays a character named Butch who is an aging boxer wanting to make a comeback. Butch is the type of character that you root for in a movie. He is down to earth, funny, and the audience can relate to him. In a way, we watch him grow from childhood to adulthood.The writer/director Quentin Tarantino, first made his debut with the film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Reservoir Dogs showcased Quentin's movie making magic, which also is showcased in Pulp Fiction. According to www.IMDb.com he has written 18 scripts for television/movies and directed 15 titles (retrieved from www.IMDb.com on February 5, 2010).There are two scenes that standout in my mind. First I must notify the reader that this might be a spoiler if you haven't seen the movie. The first scene is when Vincent is buying drugs from his dealer. The scene goes from two people having a conversation to a close-up shot of a needle being stuck into a vein in the arm. The background is completely black and we see the needle puncture the vein, draw up blood, and then watch the blood swim in the barrel of the needle. The second scene that sticks out in my mind is when Jules and Vincent are riding in the car talking with Marvin. This is another potential spoiler alert. The scene goes from all three characters discussing divine intervention when suddenly Vincent's gun goes off. The camera starts out in the car, moving from character to character. Right after the gun goes off, the camera angle is outside the car, from behind looking in. The rear window is covered in blood and then the camera moves back into the car showing the effects of what happened. Jules and Vincent are covered in blood, brain tissue, and pieces of skull.In conclusion, the movie Pulp Fiction shows how the choices that we make affect our lives. If one analyzes the movie, looks closely at each character, and what they go through in the movie we begin to understand about choices, actions, and consequences. Quentin Tarantino and the superb acting from the cast of the movie make it a must watch."
19 March 2011,treadw02,0,1,8,Tarantino's dark comedy (somewhat of spoiler),"The movie Pulp Fiction is a film by Quentin Tarantino (1994). The film host a tremendous amounts of Hollywood talent notably; John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel and even a brief cameo by Christopher Walken. The Hollywood star power comes together to create a very unique filmed based on the very bizarre lives of a couple hit men, a boxer, a man who takes care of problems and a mob boss and his wife.Pulp Fiction is a very dark humored film that focuses on the misadventures of several seemingly unrelated characters whose attempts to resolve issues in their bizarre worlds only to find themselves even deeper into trouble. Sam Jackson and John Travolta know in the film as Vincent Vega and Jules are a couple of hit men who carry on very humorous banter about such worldly items such as how Big Mac's are referred to in London. The banter between Vega and Jules adds to the dark motif of the film as the characters are presented in a very likable light even after they execute a man.One of the most significant characteristic of the film has very little to do with the actual characters but yet instead is on the way the film is edited. Bucking traditional movie flow Tarantino starts the movie with a scene from the end of the film. Much like the Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs the film jumps forward and backward at will and introduces characters throughout the film that seemingly has not tied in to each other or the plot if they ever do at all.While the film is set in relatively modern times in California the movie has a very old fashioned feel to it. The costumes worn throughout the film are dated to the seventies, Vega and Marcellus' wife go to an old fashioned shake and burger shop and the film's soundtrack also creates a retro vibe throughout the film. The dark theme that I mentioned early in the dialogue and action is carried forward in the lighting throughout much of the film.The dark vibe of the film however is clearest seen in the scene sequence where Marcellus and Butch who are held hostage in the basement of a red neck gun store. The lighting in this scene is very dark as it is in an old basement. A character is dressed in an all black gimp suit and Marcellus is taken off screen and sexually assaulted by the redneck store owner. While this event all takes place off screen the sounds creates a horrible visual image of the abuse going on.The Movie Pulp Fiction is a fantastic movie both in regards to entertainment and cinematic value. The movie creates suspense in the way it is edit and scenes are shown out of order and the dialogue is very witty and entertaining in a very dark and humorous way. This film is by far the best that I have ever seen of all Tarantino creations."
27 August 2015,simonerandazzo,0,0,10,A Cyclic Masterpiece.,"Since this is, in fact, a pure debt to the genre films, ranging from the classic gangster movie to spaghetti westerns, without disdaining the action east and ""poliziottesco all'amatriciana"", the skill of the director was to be successful in some ways to modernize the characters, making them vile in their harder side of the character as Vincent who dies leaving the bathroom or Mia Wallace that threatens the coma, and the boss sodomized, served to break into a market that lacked ideas and prototypes were beginning repeating in too serial. Pulp fiction takes its move from a pulp fiction of nature, a folk tale of a short and easy consumption, without much explanation historical-social, and with only one purpose, namely to dredge up forgotten in a Cinema to give life to the Cinema of Series A . From this moment on, the name of Tarantino become, in fact, quality mark and warranty on a whole series of works that sometimes come out also from the sown, but that eventually will give the possibility to a series of films of gender, usually considered minors, to be cleared as art films. The tricks to get this undeniable success are all explicit: the setting is excellent narrative, which is recurrent, and it is anticipated that at the end and ends as the circumference of a circle; It is excellent proof of all the actors as well as great is the director's ability to not take itself seriously, ability and strength which has served not to become easy target of criticism. Summed up the movie is a set of explosions of violence to Takeshi Kitano but where the long silences of the Japanese are added long comments and banter-free most of the time a significant content for the unfolding of history, and moments of mystical exaltation (up 25.17 Ezekiel: Revenge of the Lord) alternating threats and torment of the protagonists. For this film, you are brought in the names of Sergio Leone, David Lynch, John Woo, Jean-Luc Godard (the production company of Tarantino is called A band apart, as the eponymous film by Godard, 1964), Roger Corman , Martin Scorsese and Kubrick's The Killing (1955). In addition to the worldwide reputation of the director and have relaunched the scene the actor John Travolta, Pulp Fiction, has earned its producers 250 million dollars, launched the house Miramax as a mini-major studio and has reignited the spirit of independent filmmakers, film fans of all those who engage behind a MDP. The film was released in theaters in Italy with a ban on children under 18 years. The film she starred in the role of Jimmie, from where to John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson to hide the machine smeared with blood; actor Steve Buscemi makes a cameo as a double instead of Buddy Holly. ""I'll call some henchman stoned on crack to do a job in this process with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch"" it is just one of the best and unique characters of the film, of Marcellus Wallace."
17 July 2011,zakmartinez,0,1,10,One of those movies only a man as talented and sophisticated Quentin Tarantino could make,"This movie redefined crime movies and gave them a sense of humor. Quentin Tarantino's story focuses around hit men Vince Vega (John Travolta) and many other characters including a Drug Kingpin, Boxer, and some messed up Cops. There is not a dull moment in the movie each of the stories in the movie is great in it's own way from the dinner scene to the basement escape is amazingly written and acted out in a way that makes it stand out from anything else you may ever see in your entire life. The acting in the movie is top notch with no one holding back and giving an all star performance. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and the director himself Quentin Tarantino give it their all. Still to this day my friend and I contemplate what was in the breifcase.

Pulp Fiction is different, been my favourite film of all time since, well I was old enough to understand films and the plot etc. Tarantino was my best director up to about 2008 then Scorsese took that throne. Anyway on to the subject, the movie, I first watched it in about 1997 when I was 14, we hired it from a shop in Stoke on Trent (Birches Head). I didn't understand the movie at all with me being so young and all. I watched it again several times years later and was blown away ( no pun intended). It's a fantastic film, from the opening scene in the cafe, to the speech from Jules before he shoots the ""what what"" guy.Some parts are far fetched but hey if you can't ignore this in films then you shouldn't watch any. The cast is so good I'm lost for words and Travolta does a great job as Vincent Vega. If you don't like swearing, shooting gangsters's and awkward plots then this is not for you. Great storyline, acting, plot and the music is superb 10/10!"
1 August 2013,gonzobeast,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp fiction is masterpiece by three reasons. first reason is acting is doing very well by actors. second reason is cinematography using tracking shot, trunk shot, close shot, medium shot. third reason is directing skills by Quentin Tarantino homage many scenes from breathless,walking tall, evil dead and many more of films i am not sure to mention it. Jules and Vincent talk about what they called hamburgers of McDonald's and in Amsterdam. Quarter's Pounder with a cheese called in Amsterdam is Royale with a cheese. Big Mac called in LE Big Mac.

8 January 2015,isaaccarter60,0,2,10,This defines good filmmaking...,"I have yet to meet a person who doesn't enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Tarantino's second film and easily my favorite of his. Every single word spoken in this film has been crafted with such care. Tarantino does this with all his films, dialog drives them. There are so many elements that bring this film together and make it a prime example of good filmmaking. 1. Chemistry between characters This works so well between all characters who share the screen, but most importantly, Jules and Vincent. They are the glue which holds the whole film together. Back to the wider picture, whether they are out to get each other or they are trying to protect each other, it is entertainment at its finest.2. The WritingThis is undoubtedly my favorite movie script ever. Period. End of story. It is so perfectly executed. A day doesn't go by without me quoting one of the many famous lines from this film. So of the films darker moments, take the Gimp for example, is watchable, even enjoyable because of good writing. Something simple, like the briefcase, which would be a rather dull scenario in other films, is one of the most famous items in movie history, and lives on in internet forums 20 years after the films theatrical release.3. The CharactersThe characters are all so perfectly unique that it makes for an incredible ensemble cast of stars from different time periods and genres of films. While I've already devoted a paragraph to this, this makes for a much better film because of the chemistry between different types of actors. My personal favorite is Samuel L Jackson's role as ""Jules"". He is so funny, smart, quick and he makes for a hell of a time while your watching him. Half the famous quotes come from him. Not to mention this film catapulted Samuel L Jackson into a superstar, and gave John Travolta a second life as a megastar.4. The StoryI won't go to much into depth regarding the story, but Tarantino takes so little, and launches this into a thought provoking, crime, black comedy. The way the chapters of the story, which would go on to become a trademark of Tarantino's, mix up and take different places throughout the film is astounding.Overall, this would probably be my favorite film OF ALL TIME.End of story.Isaac Carter, 14ChristchurchNew Zealand"
21 February 2015,tombolapictures,0,1,10,The Greatest.,"Out of pulp, true fleshy meaty stories form. Set in the criminal underworld of 90's Los Angeles, Pulp Fiction revolves around the disparate yet interconnected cast. Quentin Tarantino's Par Excellence, Pulp Fiction toys with our hearts, our humour, popular culture and even the conventions of narrative cinema itself. The movie has been a firm favourite of mine for a long time. The movie has a stellar to cast to bolster the glare of the mighty storyline, with a killer soundtrack to match. It is gritty, powerful, funny, insightful, dark and precious, with some jaw dropping moments and heart stopping dialogue. As definitive a 90's movie as is ever as likely to get and stylistic to Tarantino himself, who has managed to carve his own dialect into the language of Hollywood."

I have mixed feelings. some scenes were very very dark and seemed utterly pointless. some other scenes just seemed to drag on. **spoiler** at the start when Samuel Jackson and John Travolta are heading upstairs to interrogate their ""associates"", they had a very long conversation about foot massages. it's not that they were bad scenes, it's just that they dragged on. And once the movie was over, I was struggling to find the point to it. And there were lots of loose ends, the whole Bruce Willis situation was left somewhat open. SPOILER******when john Travolta was shot it seemed extremely weird because nothing happened after it, it just...happened. But after all this, the whole movie is worth watching do to the scenes with Samuel Jackson and ""Wolf"". as well as the last set of scenes, when there is the robbery in the cafe.

22 June 2013,BigTipTinyShaft,0,1,7,Most Overrated Turd of a Movie In Existence,"Quentin Tarantino is an artist. He brings the viewer into his quirky world of violence through suspenseful dialog and eccentric characters. However, he cannot tell a story to save his life.Pulp Fiction is a random assemblage of events that have little relation with each other. Their connection in the end is supposed to give the viewer a heartwarming revelation; however, it is simply arbitrary.These events end without a conclusion: nothing is learned, nothing is lost, and no emotions are felt.An enjoyable ride with no conclusion does not a great movie make.In conclusion (learn from me Quentin), I rate this movie 7 stars out of 10.Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained were all better."
29 January 2015,shashankys1234,0,0,10,Best Tarantino movie by a long way,"This movie has some of the best dialogue I have heard in movies. Even though it doesn't have a lot of action, this movie kept me hooked because of the interaction between the characters. For example the entire scene where they are trying to clean ""Marvin"" out of the car, Harvey Keitel interacting with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, with a cameo from Quentin Tarantino. This scene was one of my favorite from any movie. Another scene that I really enjoyed was the gimp scene with Bruce Willis and Marcellus Wallace (don't know the actor's name).The only scene that I don't really like is the one with Bruce Willis and his girlfriend in their apartment, even though it has some great dialogue, I didn't really care for their relationship.

The lead breakfast scene came on and I stopped everything I was doing and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I've been a film buff ever since. This film taught me there is more that goes into a film than it's special effects. I was born the summer this movie came out so I grew up in a different era. I was always so bored when I would watch a talking movie but my mind listened to and registered everything that was coming out of the actors mouths and it was great! Since that day, I continued to show all my friends and watch it one at a time with them. I learn more and more about the film each watch and I am starting to see Tarantinos easter eggs that tie his universe together."

Sam never tried the drug, directed by Quentin Tarantino Travolta sent to investigate the preferences of his character by being in communion with the period of recovery to former junk, which Quentin knew personally. Travolta asked a friend Tarantino to explain to him what it was like to sit on the character (of course, without the use of drugs). A friend of Tarantino explained: ""If you want to get the slightest idea about it, get drunk tequila and go in the hot pool. So you just barely touch the feelings that causes heroin. "" Then John Travolta said he was pleased to inform his wife that he was told that in order to study aspects of the nature of the forthcoming role, he must drink tequila and lie down in the hot pool.

If you're with it, ""Pulp Fiction"" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L.

One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene."
25 July 2013,AdamPeterMarsden,0,0,10,All Time Modern Classic - A Disjointed Review,"Tarantino never fails to impress with this all time modern classic, the film follows the lives of some very interesting character's, opening with the ""Bonny and Clyde"" duo Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. The film has nothing but everything to do with the duo as the film opens and closes with the two in toe, some of the most rememberable one liners of the films contain the duo as they nock off an ordinary LA diner.As the film progresses we are introduced to two new characters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield ( Samuel L Jackson) both hired guns en route to a hit. Vincent seems ever the realist, slow talking cool and confident, Jules the poetic, religious man dog. The speeches between the two characters throughout the film are both realistic, yet pointless pillow talk, that gives the film a somewhat believable quality no matter how far fetched some of the stories may be, Tarantino has the nack of making them sound true by adding this banter between scenes, almost acting as an air break or rest stop from the action and violence.Later on we meet Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the wife of Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) The kingpin of the Tarantino underworld. Uma is cool, sexy and always something has to say. Her mysterious entrance is made when Vincent Vega is asked by Marsellu, if he would take care of her for the night while he is out of town. This in it's self is another story and another adventure in the film, Vincent takes her out for lunch at the well known but not so famous, Jack Rabbit Slims this scene again is one of the most iconic and talked about moments from the film. Here we also also exposed to Tarantino's rockabilly music taste which encompasses the film so well.Bruce Willis makes his way onto the screen in Pulp Fiction as a one hit KO boxer,Butch Coolidge. his story begins with the ""Gold Watch"" story, this gold watch symbolises Butch''s drive through life, as we learn that the watch has survived through many war's struggles and pains, if a simple gold watch can make it this far, so can butch. His drive through the film is to escape an accidental murder, the result of a boxing match, however many pitfalls await him and his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros)Just a light intro to the film and it's colourful characters within, but all in all a timeless classic and a must see for any film buff, or anyone that watches films in this case, I struggle to find anyone that doesn't have at least one good thing to say about this film, as it contains all the qualities of a masterpiece to be talked about time and time again!Hard to believe this film is almost 20 years old!"
16 January 2014,kittikatlopez,0,1,9,a must see film,"I've personally watched this movie since I was a kid, my mum didn't really care about the language or drug use, she just wanted me to be a Tarantino fan...and I am. Is it bad that my favorite seen in the entire movie is ****spoiler**** when Mia overdoses and Vince and Lance argue in front of Lance's house while Mia lays on his lawn dying? I don't care, it's hilarious. This movie really is one of Tarantino's best, and it contains a killer cast. Not to mention Tarantino's little cameo (which he does in all his movies). All together I love the acting, the cast, and the story line behind everything. They all mix well and the jumps are great. Everyone should see this film, worth 9 stars."
28 June 2013,girane0703,0,0,10,very happy with the film,"""Pulp Fiction"" is unique in the sense that it is the product of an unusually harmonious, striking a perfect proportionality of all its parts and components. And despite the fact that many of the elements of the artistic fabric of the film, instantly served as an object for imitation, are boldly innovative in themselves. An indelible impression colorful characters cohort. Any of the frame is decorated with a great sense of style, is remembered outstanding color scheme, the rhythm seems alive, the acting is striking naturalness and yet well thought-out every word and gesture, etc. But in the first place among the findings must include a sparkling, amazingly witty, inventive and uninhibited speech that pours from the screen, caused by the special delight of critics. It seems there is no such subject (from mediocre household to profound), which would not have been affected by the authors, one way or another ... It sounded Hamlet ""words, words, words"" can achieve several important goals, being both highly functional with respect to the action, means of expressing the author's position, at last, so full of genuine poetry. .Excellent movie of the ones I was looking for the last time. Good, nice story that despite his, ahem, old age, does not meet these films on the subject. The dialogs in the film, as well as the reaction of the characters in the ""stimulus"" by themselves are worth seeing the film. In general, if you have love for the action comedy, with uninfected good emotion - this movie is for you. А film that wants to revise again and again..."

                        ",A Tarantino's Piece of Art,"In 1994, Quentin Tarantino directed and co wrote his fifth movie, and my favorite one, as the other movies, that Tarantino directed, this one was a master piece. This movie is perfect in all the senses, from the top to the bottom, the script is impeccable, in my opinion it doesn't have any failure. The time as the movie develops is a little bit confusing because of the jumps in time in all the sequences but is understandable. All the movie is a piece of history, all the characters are immoral and all of them got an essence, that make them special. The movie is violent and raw, but also it got a comedy touch in The Wolf scene for example. It is simply amazing movie, and in my opinion a movie that you got to see before you die. And as a warning, this movie doesn't have any message, the script is a little bit bulgar, there are hard images, a lot of violence, so if you are looking for a soft movie, this is not your movie. But if you don't have any trouble with that you must, and I repeat, you must see this movie."
13 September 2012,radfor04,0,1,10,What Goes Around Comes Around,"The plot of Pulp Fiction contains three separate but intertwined stories about people living a criminal lifestyle. There is a boxer, Butch Coolidge, who is played by Bruce Willis and a gangster, Marcellus Wallace, who is played by Ving Rhames. Butch and Marcellus are conspiring to fix a boxing match so that Marcellus can profit by placing a bet on the match. There is the wife of Marcellus, Mia Wallace, who is played by Uma Thurman and a hit man, Vincent Vega, who is played by John Travolta. While Marcellus is out of town on business Vincent is tasked with entertaining Mia for the evening and they manage to get into trouble. There is Vincent Vega and another hit man, Jules Winfield, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Vincent and Jules are tasked with collecting a valuable package on behalf of Marcellus and that turns out to be a very violent encounter.The theme of Pulp Fiction is one reaps what one sows. In several instances main characters that seem to be living a comfortable lifestyle get involved in some risky behavior and each of them ended up suffering dire consequences as a result. A motif which is repeated in Pulp Fiction is the bible verse Ezekiel 25:17. Over the course of my life I have spent far more time attending church services than I have watching Pulp Fiction, but this motif is so memorable that it has become the only bible verse which I have memorized. The initial citing of the verse was near the beginning of the film and it was told in a vengeful manor. When the same verse was repeated at the very end of the movie the same words told a tale of redemption. The lighting in Pulp Fiction is quite bright through the film. Even in scenes such as a darkened bar or a convertible with the top down at night where one would expect the characters to be cast in shadows they are illuminated to the point where it almost feels as though they are facing a spotlight.There is a significant amount of violent content in Pulp Fiction and the entire story revolves around characters engaging in illegal conduct. Despite those facts there is a definite comedic sense which emanates from the film. Some of the violent scenes were so outrageous and over the top that I found myself reacting as though I was watching a cartoon where Yosemite Sam was firing a shotgun at Bugs Bunny. It doesn't get much more violent than firing a gun in the direction of another being but the audience tends to laugh it off because the action is clearly not real.Another movie which intertwines the separate stories of people engaging in criminal activity is Heat. Heat was directed by Michael Mann and was released in 1995. Unlike the over the top violence in Pulp Fiction, Heat has a tone which is quite serious, and it is realistic to the point where the viewer feels as though they could be watching a live portrayal of actual events."
24 September 2012,kuntsepeace1,0,1,9,Royale with Cheese,"Novels written in the early 20th Century for general audience, emphasizing exciting and titillating plots. That's what ""pulp fiction"" is defined as, and that's just what Pulp Fiction is, exciting and titillating.Ever since Reservoir Dogs back in 1992, Tarantino has kept on producing top quality films such as this one in 1994, the Kill Bill series, Death Proof, and most recently, Inglourious Basterds. One of Quentin Tarantino's greatest work and truly a masterpiece in it's own sense, the timing was perfect; made during the transition phase from the 20th to the 21st Century, Pulp Fiction isn't too intense for the past generation and isn't too old for the current to disapprove of. It won the Palme D'Or Award when it premiered at the Cannes film festival. Although Tarantino and his screenplay partner Roger Avary received the award only for the best original screenplay, it was also nominated for the best picture and the best director at the 1995 Academy Awards. There are numerous other awards and countless nominations that Pulp Fiction has received over the years.If you're familiar with Tarantino's earlier works, then you know that nonlinear storytelling is his trademark. This is also incorporated in Pulp Fiction where the narrative is structured around three separate but intersecting story lines. The lead of the first story is the mob hit-man Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta. The boxer Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis, is the lead of the second, and Vincent's partner, Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is the lead of the third. It is an excellent example of a postmodern film, where mainstream conventions and norms are twisted and churned into brilliance. But I do warn the easily queasy and squeamish, there is A LOT of graphic violence, drug use, and profanity in this movie. It is definitely not a movie for children to watch and I wouldn't recommend taking your date out to watch it.However, if you aren't familiar with this type of storytelling and think you can handle the violence, you should definitely give it a go. When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I didn't know what to expect either. The movie poster seemed like an old cheap rundown book cover and I had never heard of Tarantino before. However, after my first watch, I was totally sold. The acting by Travolta, Willis, and especially, Jackson were profound; it was their prime performance. The cinematography, lead by the same people who had worked with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs, fit the story very well. An excellent portrayal of this is in the scene in the car where Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face and his matter is spread all over the interior of the car. Marvin's body and the gunshot wound aren't shown in the movie; the audience only sees the gunshot and a lot of blood in the car. This allows the viewer to imagine the scene in his/her own way.The nonlinear storytelling is also well portrayed in this movie. It might throw the average viewer off at first; however, you get accustomed to it, and by the end, you've a good understanding of the plot. Also, the dialogue in the movie is very plain and normal; the characters' conversation is what an average Joe would have when doing the same thing. This makes the characters relate with the audience. An example of this is in the scene in the beginning of the movie where Vincent and Jules discuss about a Quarter-pounder with Cheese from McDonalds being called Royale with Cheese in France because of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is truly something worth watching in your lifetime. I definitely recommend this movie; even if you don't enjoy it, you will appreciate the genius it oozes. So grab your popcorn with extra butter and your diet Pepsi, or what have you, lie back on your couch, and enjoy!"
7 May 2014,TimCundy,0,1,10,Praising Pulp,"Pulp Fiction is just a cult classic that will stay with me until the day I die. Tarantino twists and corrupts some of the oldest cliché stories in the book forming together Pulp Fiction. One of the greatest moments in this film is when Bruce Willis' character Butch spots Marselis Wallace at the crosswalk. It was the perfect combination of dark humor and suspense. The entire scene is completely terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The reason the scene is so great is because you find yourself laughing at the very fact that rape is happening, because in no scenario made up in your head, rape was the ending factor. Just a brilliant film."
19 May 2014,TheCHVM,0,1,9,A Master Piece,"The Story is great, Dialogs of Samuel L. Jackson are litchi as hell, i still try to learn that scene from the Kahoona Burger, Quentin Tarantino is master doing this movie, and its the 20 anniversary, congrats and thank you Quentin.Something that i believe underrated is from Bruce Willis character, witch is one of the plot characters in the story, i mean we have the most beloved character with Samuel and Travolta with his Royal with cheese.In conclusion, it worth watching the entire movie with extremely detailed, and you will still love it, its funny and its a freaking classic"
13 September 2015,bodlak,0,0,10,Stars and excellent music,"This movie is full of stars and yet they do not make you blind. The characters are all perfect, working together for a greater glory of the movie. Several independent stories and persons meet each other from time to time which makes a great view of a dirty city, the real life below the everyday visible face of the same city. You certainly don't want to become part of this story :) but you can see if from a distance (chair in the cinema or in front of TV set) - this is certainly safe.What needs a special mention is a music: so many outstanding songs, always chosen in perfect unity with the story, plot, characters... you will not believe it is possible."
30 April 2015,csfjeep,1,8,4,Not one of Quentin Tarantino best films but you will get a few laughs.,"******SPOILER ALERT****** Two individuals Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda AKA Honey Bunny are sitting in a diner discussing places to commit robbery. They discuss the bank, stores and even people. The one place they decide that keeps money at all times and won't have to put up a fight with employees is the restaurant that they are currently eating at. They proceed to rob the eatery. There is two mob men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) who are out to retrieve a briefcase that was stolen from their mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). As they begin their search they are talking about how their boss threw a man out of the window for rubbing Mrs. Wallace's (Uma Thurman) feet. Vincent speaks that it is more than that but Jules is convinced it is nothing. Marcellus ask Vincent to take his wife out on the town for a night since he will not be in town. Vincent obliged in the mist of retrieving the briefcase their lives are changed dramatically. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is in debt with Marcellus and is currently running from him because he was paid to lose the fight. Not only did he win the fight he killed the other boxer. An incident occurs and both are tied up in a pawn shop fighting to get away. Butch manages to set himself free but cannot find it in himself to let Marcellus suffer any more than he has already. He defeats the kidnappers sets Marcellus free, runs to save his own life and to never speak of what happens nor return back home. In the mist of all of these characters lives, in one way or another their lives mingle to have some kind of connection. There is plenty of laughter that is throughout the film that if one is not paying great attention one will miss the jokes. If anything the film will keep you laughing. The music that is used in the film will also keep one in suspense as to what will happen next. One would think that in one scene Butch was going to get himself killed because of the way he was running through the lots. One would think that the killer would come up behind him and kills him. However that was not the case. He ends up killing someone else and the sound effects presented as if one was in the middle of the action. The lighting throughout the film was of natural light. Almost every scene that was shot was by some type of window or even outside. Instead of the restaurant that Vincent and Mia went to and enjoyed a $5.00 milk shake. The lighting in the pawn shop was also bright but when they went to the back of course made it a little dim. In each scene there were the same motif pattern. All colors, even on the walls were bland and out dated even for the time this movie took placed. All colors used in the scenes were basic colors. The more natural colors. The film it is more like a time film where it bounces back and forth from present and the past. One would need to follow closely in order to get the full meaning of the film."

28 June 2013,adammurrayxd,0,2,6,"A non biased review on ""one of the best films of all time!""","Tarantino for me is a good director. Not a great director and certainly not the best. Many people I know hail Pulp Fiction as not only Tarantino's best film ever, but the best film of all time. I like Tarantino. He is a smart writer with a lot of interesting ideas. Some of which i think are better than the others. Pulp fiction contains a lot of those brilliant unique ideas but I feel, fails to put them into practice in order to make an interesting and exciting film.*Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the film already go watch it and decide for yourself. Then see if you agree with me after.*Any good film should have characters that the viewer can care about and be interested in. Now seeing as Pulp Fiction is split in to different stories of different people that is already a hard thing to do. Hard but not impossible. Sin City despite its many faults had me rooting the whole way through hoping that Bruce Willis would be safe and manage to rescue Jessica Alba from the clutches of that strange yellow guy.Pulp fiction however does not manage the same. After the incredibly smart conversation between Travolta and Jackson in the opening scene I was loving the film. I really liked the writing even if this sort of Philosophical conversation didn't quite fit Travolta's Pony-tailed Hit-man character.The abrupt switching to Bruce Willis' story then made me almost forget about Travolta all together, so much so that when, who i thought was the main protagonist, gets shot halfway through the film. It didn't really mean anything. I moved on. It wasn't impacting enough for me to feel any sort of emotion. It was like when the wise talking heavy gunner in a Vietnam movie gets shot. You quite liked him. But you can move on without him.The scene with Harvey Keitel however was brilliant. My favourite part of the film without a doubt. Its just a shame he didn't play more of a part.Other than characters, I felt that the films real weakness was the lack of any strong plot. Yeah all of the crooks stories manage to inter-wind but i didn't feel that they were interesting enough for that to be the films main selling point. I felt at the end i had quite enjoyed what i just saw but really i could have not seen it and went on with my day. I personally feel like Pulp Fiction is a film that relies entirely on its Style to try and carry it forward. I will admit, it is a film with a very well written script, great conversation pieces and an incredible cast. It just fails at being anything more than boring."
22 June 2013,Maria-White88,0,0,9,Tarantino's Best!!,"I never get tired reading some of the reviews on this site.It provides insight into why films like ""Crossroads"" make so much money! ""Pulp Fiction"" won Academy Awards here and in the UK for writing. Golden Globe awards, etc were thrown at this film because people in the know, love this movie. In contrast, films like Titanic, who get lots of hype, but win not one single award for acting or writing (just check and you will see that I am right), this film won many awards, and deserved each and every one. This holds especially true when you look at the competition that year (Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, among others).It cracks me up when I read these posts that make jokes about the fans of films like this one. They seem to always take jabs at the intelligence of those who like them. Well, I will take the gritty hard hitting dramas that are hailed by everyone who knows anything about films. You guys can watch ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" again. You might be able to follow that plot"
11 August 2013,d-neal3444,0,0,9,My review.,"Pulp Fiction is a story of how two hit men Vincent and Jules who work for L.A.'s crime boss Marcellus Wallace and how Jules begins to have a change of heart due to feeling that he witnessed a miracle for God. It is also about a boxer who double crosses the crime boss and how they eventually handle their conflict. There are also sub plots about Marcellus Wallace's wife and her night out on the town with her husband's employee Vincent Vega. All of these stories culminate in Jules having an epiphany as he spare the lives of a ""would be robber"" couple. In this film, Quentin Tarantino weaves several extreme stories together- some romance, a little contract killing, drug use and overdose, kidnap, rape, a double-cross and a manhunt- into an extremely shocking, yet entertaining coherent film. In this movie there are multiple themes communicated to the viewer. One of the prominent themes was about never judging people because anyone at anytime can change and choose to become more. He demonstrated that theme in scenes where enemies become allies and hit men save life instead of taking it. Another major theme was that every choice a person makes has its inevitable consequences. Tarantino emphasized this by showing those who choose to hurt people will be repaid in kind. The cheater gets cheated, a killer gets killed, and people who abuse drugs nearly die from overdose. Tarantino also uses his creative license throughout this film in order to jump back and forth in time thus drawing the viewer in. Tarantino deliberately leaves the viewer trying to figure out what is going on piece by intriguing piece, as well as allowing the viewer to try and understand the behavior of characters in earlier scenes that while entertaining seemed shocking and sometimes comically absurd. Although sometimes viewers may know or think they know what will happen to a particular character before it happens, it is still impossible to know how that character will react or what kind of impact it may have on the other characters within the film. Quentin Tarantino is totally unpredictable so that makes outguessing him nearly impossible. Tarantino's movies on the other hand, always have his signature flare. This movie is filled with shocking dialog, and he creates comedy by contrasting extreme violence with irony. There are instances where characters would have casual conversations about being vegetarian, or the Big Kahuna Burger while in the process of killing a roomful of people. One of them even asked one of the soon to be victims if he could taste his Kahuna Burger and have a sip of his tasty beverage. The length of the movie was a bit long (two and a half hours) and does have long stretches of dialog with little action, but the outrageous and shocking action scenes that follow definitely make them worth tolerating. Overall this film is very entertaining with surprising plot twists and a powerful conclusion. With shocking scenes and witty dialog, along with an all star cast, this movie should be on everyone's must see list."
16 November 2016,sugar_lera,0,0,10,Best Tarantino movie,"This exceptional movie shows how unique Quentin Tarantino is as a director.Maybe this is his best known movie, but I watched it after many others, and I really don't know why.It has everything that a crime movie should have: blood, bad boys, aggressive scenes, it is harsh, but you can enjoy it with all that.The best part of it, is the construction of the movie, that puzzles you, scenes from the past, the present, the future, all mixed up...and you really want to see how everything is going to end.As far as the actors are concerned, Quentin Tarantino really knows how to choose his cast, he always gets the best and this movie is no exception:John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette and his muse- Uma Thurman.These actors knew how to make this movie great and the movie cemented their careers and made them even bigger stars."
2 January 2006,kevinpfs,0,1,9,Excellent,"I love this movie. Especially the scene where Butch saves Marcellus and we hear the big speech about is everything OK between you and me. I wish I could find a restaurant as cool as ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"" to eat at. I have only seen two of Quentin's movies (Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown) but I intend to see them all if they are as good as these two. Quentin's style may seem confusing to some viewers (all the scenes are not in chronological order) but that is what I like about it. It makes you see how in real life two people can see the same thing two entirely different ways, especially if they see it at different times or don't get the whole story at once. Rock on Quentin, and keep us guessing!"

4 August 2014,ayesha_966,0,0,7,"Good, Entertaining, and Mildly Funny","When I watched Pulp Fiction, I didn't have a specific plot line in mind. However, the plot did surprise me to an extent. I thought it was disturbingly smart, and well-scripted. It's one of those movies you watch with a small, open-minded crowd. I say this because the movie is R rated and based around drug use and 'gang-like' themes, as well as sexual content alike. It is a nice movie to tick off of your 'Movies-To-Watch' list. However, there is, what I believe to be, a bit of dark humor, and it may be offensive to some people, but as I've mentioned before, it has to be watched with a willing, and open mind. Overall, good movie, but it did not exceed my expectations. It was disappointing, it was just not what I had in mind."

But if you have seen it then you'll know it's one massive adrenaline needle to the heart from start to finish, there are also many recognizable actors throughout which makes the story more concrete and in my opinion more enjoyable.Samuel L Jackson definitely sets the bar for acting in this movie with a speech that will stick with everyone who sees it, props to Quentin Tarantino for doing a cameo in his own film again (Reservoir Dogs) and Uma Thurman for being so damn beautiful and cool. Pulp Fiction also has many quotes that are memorable, like ""Royale with cheese."" I give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves nothing less."

But time after time, I keep coming back to John Travolta with long hair and Samuel L. Jackson with an afro, arguing over foot massages and accidentally shooting young black men in the head. Not to mention Bruce Willis's awe-inspiring line which has now turned into a band: ""Zed's Dead."" I don't know the name for the feeling that overcomes a person when one sees something that might just be TOO cool, but whatever it is, it keeps coming back as the film progresses, and it somehow even becomes more enjoyable. I'm going to call it ""Tarantinotude."" The emotion that makes your jaw drop; not because you're seeing something especially grotesque or insane, but because you just can't comprehend the fact that a scene could be so inexplicably BAD-ASS."

                        ",Jules and Scotty,"Theory - Jules is Scotty.In the coffee shop Vincent explains to Jules that he will be a bum if he retires. That would make Jules start to think about financially supporting his future work for God.When Ringo demands the case from Jules he comments that carrying someones ""dirty laundry"" is not such a great job. Jules agrees. He probably rationalizes that Marsallis owes him for almost getting him killed.When Jules and Vincent return to the bar, Jules looks at the direction of Marsallis and Butch then excuses himself to the bathroom. We never see Butch and Jules interact.The fact that Butch would go back to the apartment for the watch shows that he has taken a few too many blows to the head and could never think up a plan to outsmart Marsallis.Jules knows Marsallis' operation and would know where to place the bets without Marsallis finding out, after letting out the word that the fight was fixed. Jules knows how to make the bookies pay.Butch calls Scotty "" My brother, my man """

Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job utilizing a bit of David Mamet influence in this film. John Travolta Did his thing as always and I can honestly say I have watched this movie now at least 5 times now. The acting of course was pretty phenomenal. But what do you expect with an all star cast and Oscar-winning script. Samuel L. Jackson is also one of my favorite actors. I've watched him grow through his career and really enjoyed this role of his as Jules which I believe showed us that he could be so much more diverse than mo Betta blues and Jurassic park. In all great movie, great writing, production, and most importantly acting. They say your only as good as your weakest link. Well this movie has none."
3 January 2019,kevindjack30,0,1,10,A cult classic that will live on in film history,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that brings you to world of individuals with life altering events and as you view the chaos of each event, you feel like your in the passenger seat the whole time.
The cinematic style feels gritty and yet smooth like aqua green leather car seat. You want to lay back and take in the influence of each shot. From the diner opening shot knowing the smell of bacon and sausage would have been cooking on the grill, to the gimp scene the old wood and moldy smell of the corners of a basement.
With the all star cast you will easily watch and disregard the fact that these are actors and believe these people are real.
This movie has held up to the test of time and will always a reference to film students and film lovers for years to come."
29 March 2014,chloe_barsby,0,1,7,Brilliant,"Not only is the film hilariously entertaining it is probably one of history's finest. Amusing conversations to witty one-liners, this film keeps you laughing right up and till the end. The chemistry between John Travolta and Uma Thurman is fantastic, almost electric and the whole film is played out well on the whole. The scenes between John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are probably the most amusing from talking about foot massages to beers in Paris. Be warned that this film does include some blood so stay clear if thats not what you enjoy. On a whole this film is perfectly written and well directed, there isn't much more that could be done to make this any better."

It's Great movie to watch with your girlfriend in a Saturday night! Grab some popcorn and soda, and enjoy the movie. It contains a great history and dance scene is just amazing, very funny!Unlike most other movies where the hour is too fast and it feels like its never going to end. The pacing, casting, acting, cinematography is all great. Who knew the genius behind reservoir dogs could still have some good creativity inside of him. I know it sounds like i'm praising too much and everything. You just need to watch it yourself there is a reason why it's a classic.The script is amazing, some of the best writing I have ever heard in a film, the acting is great, the story is cool, and, most of all, the film is entertaining.One of the best films I have ever seen."

For example watch story its a little bit awkward when I watch first time.but second time I laugh so hard my brother be surprised. Quentino Tarantino became my favorite director.I watched his few movies after this one. John Travolta's dance with Uma Thurman that I can't forget. Samuel Jackson and Travolta s talks are cool to.They re talking non sense.but second time is better. Finally wolf guy ,they called for help, he is coming and giving them order that scene very cool.

                        ",Big bad world and there are still people willing to help. Spoilers!,"There is spoilers.Pulp Fiction (1994) has multiple characters that show that even in this big bad world that we live in that there are still people that will help us when we are need. The main characters lives that are followed throughout the film are all intertwined with the crime boss. There is the crime boss, Marsellus Wallace played by Ving Rhames,that puts a hit out on a prize fighter Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis. They get themselves into a situation when trying to kill each other and Butch gets free and about leaves but turns around to help Marsellus out of the situation as well. Then you have Marsellus's two criminals, Jules Winnfield played by Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Vega played by John Travolta, that go around killing people that are behind on paying Marsellus his money or has done Marsellus wrong. Vincent ends up helping Marsellus's wife, Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman, when she overdoses on drugs. Then, we have Jules who does not kill the couple that is trying to rob everyone in the restaurant, including trying to take his boss's briefcase. These so called ""bad guys"" are not really bad, they just do bad things and do help a person out when help is needed.This film portrays these so called ""bad guys"" by using low-angle camera shots. As these ""bad guys"" help those in need, they are shown in high-angle or regular straight angle shots portraying that they are no longer ""bad guys."" Another technique that is used throughout the film is fade-out/fade-in transitions. These are used to transition to another scene or just to show that time has passed. For example, when Vincent and Mia were at Jack Rabbit Slims to eat and then it fades-out and fades-in when they are at Mia's residence.Another film that shows that ""bad guys"" are really not that bad and people helping others is The Green Mile (1999). This film shows that the ""bad guys"" are human beings as well and that they only did bad things, but are not bad people. The ""bad guys"" in this film also help others and show compassion towards others, including a mouse.If you can look past the bad things that are happening to these characters and see the good in it, this is a movie that you would love to see. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen."

17 September 2014,lehman18,0,1,7,This film has many of today's big actors and actresses.,"This film has many of today's big actors and actresses. Vincent Vega, who was played by John Travolta, and Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L Jackson, are hit-men that are hired by the mobster Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames. However, after a shooting Jules Winnfield decides to remove himself from the gangster life. Shortly after Winnfield left the gangster life Vega is assigned my Wallace to take is wife out for the night to do whatever she wanted to do. The night ended at the Wallace house where Mia, played by Uma Thurman, overdosed on drugs. Criminal activity, money, and drugs seems to be the theme of this film. At the film we see the gangsters, Winnfield and Vega killing three people in what looks to be an apartment, and throughout the rest of the film we see flashbacks of criminal activity involving the two gangsters. We see in several scenes where mobster Wallace hires different people to perform certain activities, we see the money be transferred from the hands of Wallace to each character performing, in most cases, illegal activity. Lastly, the drugs in Pulp Fiction are a constant in the film. We see several instances where Vega is doing a drug. We also see Mia Wallace overdose on drugs and almost lost her life. This movie reminds me of the film The Way of the Gun made in 2000. The two films have a lot of criminal activity throughout the movie and it is all for one thing. The money. Characters in both films seem to be extremely greedy, and are willing to do just about anything, including killing people and kidnapping a young adult, to make a quick extra dollar.Vincent Vega's flashbacks in the movie, I thought, really added to the movie. We can see the type of relationship Vega had with Jules Winnfield. To me the flashbacks show the greatness the team of Vega and Winnfield had. I thought Vega wasn't as great of a gangster as he looked to be when he was working with Winnfield before he left the business. I also felt the camera angles in this film could have been better. One scene that stuck out the most to me with the camera angles was with Butch Coolidge we only see him talking and the back of Marsellus Wallace's head. To me this scene was a bit boring because we the camera was only on Coolidge. In order to be more effective I think the camera should have gone back and forth between Coolidge and Wallace for the viewer to really feel interested in the scene."
3 October 2014,cynthia-flageolle,0,0,8,"Pulp Fiction, a film masterpiece","Pulp Fiction is a crime, drama, thriller that was released in October 1994 and directed by the infamous Quinten Tarantino. Currently Pulp Fiction holds a rating of 9 out of 10 on IMDb.com and is rated R based on the movie rating scale. As a crime drama thriller it is expected to be fast paced, keep you on the edge of your seat, and tug at your heart just a little and Pulp Fiction did just that. Pulp Fiction was nothing short of a typical movie in the crime drama thriller genre. The way the film was set up was not in typical chronological order. The movie is set up in what I would call a chapter format, and it covers stories of individuals and through those stories you learn how they are all connected. Although I feel this is a good way to format a movie, it was a little confusing at time and made me go ""huh?"". I think the editing in this film fit what Tarantino was trying to convey to the audience. The only part like I said before that was not conducive for a movie goer is how it can be confusing at times. For example there is a moment in the movie where Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was killed by Butch Coolidge played by Bruce Willis and immediately following that ""chapter"" Vincent Vega was alive and well, it was not until later in the movie it was understood that this movie was done in the chapter format. The editing throughout this movie was spot on. The sound through the movie was the done impeccably. The music fit every scene perfectly. For example when Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman went to dinner at a dinner that replicated famous era's in the past and had servers that were look alike to past famous people the music was from the 50's era. During the twist competition the music was the music they played back when the twist was in style. During the fast paced scenes it was a fast paced sound that made your heart pump a little faster and helped with the anticipation the audience would be feeling. Overall the sound was very effective. The crime aspect of this film was very apparent. I think it had more crime than drama and thriller. There were a lot of crude remarks made. One thing I found offensive and turned me off on the movie a little, was the amount of racial slurs that were used throughout the movie. Another thing there was not a lack of was gore. There were a lot of killings, blood, guts, and an inappropriately sexual scene. Crime movies usually include drugs and Pulp Fiction was no different, however I do not think it was an abundance or unusual amount for a crime genre. Because of the amount of blood, gore, drugs and mainly racial slurs used in this movie my opinion is not as high as it could be about this movie. If I am solely looking at the editing, sound, cinematography, and other aspects of film making it was an excellently crafted film, however the content left a little to be desired. I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 however I would recommend this to adults that like the genre of crime and thriller because it contains everything I would expect of that genre and will not leave them unhappy."

21 April 2015,David_Colon,0,0,10,The best film ever,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. They're as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (""The car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. She's the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. That's before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, ""YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D. to YOUR house, I'LL stick in the needle!"" Bruce Willis and Maria de Medeiros play another couple: He's a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. She's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control."
26 April 2015,wjackson-66353,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction - An Iconic Journey,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that begins and ends in the same place, a diner. This being said, the movie is not just a single layer film. Pulp fiction has layers upon layers that build upon it. Major characters and bit players all contribute to the convergence of story line in this film. To watch it once does not truly do it justice. To appreciate the film, the viewer needs to take in every moment. The movie follows the movements of 2 mob hit men (Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield) played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as they try to obtain and return a briefcase containing some unknown glowing ""beautiful"" item. This movie is better understood if it is pictured as a giant circle. When the movie starts is actually where it's ending. This could be considered madness or genius on the part of the Director, Quentin Tarantino. As the hit men try to get the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames, they encounter a boxer who is trying to stiff Marsellus, named Butch played by Bruce Willis. A memorable scene in the movie involves Uma Thurman who plays Marsellus' wife, Mia. Vincent saves her from overdosing on cocaine. As the movie unfolds, each nuance plays into the overall plot of this film. The theme of the film deals with the truth of human nature. Pulp Fiction doesn't delve deeply into each character's background, history or story; it merely gives you a small bite of the character. An example of this is when Mia asks Vincent about Amsterdam. He states that he just got back after being there for 3 years. Not why he was there or what he was doing there, just that he was simply there. This film focuses only how each character plays into the overall purpose of Jules and Vincent getting the briefcase to Marsellus and then weaves each character into the plot. When we meet Butch, we find out why his father's watch is so important, but we never meet the father. Tarantino only wants us to know how the watch leads to his encounter with Marsellus. Each character is merely a representation of a type of person: The hit man, the mob boss, the boxer, the mob wife, etc. Tarantino likes a lot of dialogue in his films. Some cannot get past his excessive use of profanity and long conversations. He uses this in most of his films, such as Kill Bill which has been dubbed a ""revenge film,"" but there is a lot of dialogue throughout the film that leads the viewer on the journey to revenge. Two important elements in the movie are the importance of visual imagery and the use of music. From the iconic scene at Jack Rabbit Slims with the retro theme to the basement at Maynard's shop with the gimp to the inside of Jules' car after he accidentally shoots Marvin, visual imagery is key. Music is also very important, again at Jack Rabbit Slims during the Twist Contest when ""You Never Can Tell"" is playing and again later when Mia comes back home and is dancing to ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon,"" each song creates the scene for the audience. The soundtrack for this film is still head and shoulders above the all others and to this viewer is the most memorable part of the film itself. When Pulp Fiction came out, people rushed to buy soundtracks to movies and this proves why. Each song has a purpose and its purpose, just like the entire movie itself, is pure genius."
7 May 2015,martoipod,0,0,10,gangster's thriller,"Known as a gangster's bizarre thriller, pulp fiction was directed by Quentin Tarantino and released in the year 1994. Starring Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, and John Travolta (Vincent Vega) and Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield) as two criminals, this film won two Oscars and cost 8 million dollars. Jules and Vincent work for their mafia boss Marcellus Wallace. He is dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to lose a fight on purpose after taking Wallace's money and is now planning to leave the city, but he can't because he lost his father's watch. Vincent faces some problems when Wallace asks him to take his wife Mia out for a good time while he's away. The movie is presented in a series of chapters where the lives of unrelated people are put together in funny and black comedy events. The ending is very much unexpected. Pulp fiction was a 90's classics and the best gangster's thriller I've ever seen. The performance of the actors is amazing, the script is brilliant and the music is excellent. This film appeals to an audience of over fifteen who love thrillers."

31 July 2015,tsarkowistas,0,1,9,What a great movie is...,"""PULP FICTION""Do you know what a great movie is? It is an odd, bizarre montage, dedicated to you, portraying yourself. A mirror.As the movie shows you violence, sex and drugs, it provokes your disturbed personality you so desperately have always wanted to hide. It unleashes the beast in you. It grabs you from your skin to the most feared underground you long time obliviously abandoned. What a mess.Let's be frank. Didn't you feel any satisfaction with the scenes of the now established and celebrated ""Pulp Fiction""? Why was this piece of work so much acclaimed from the critics as it was from the audience? Because you are satisfied with every inch that movie shows you. And you feel uncomfortable about that. And somehow you like that inconvenience. And it is embarrassing talking about it, right?For some critics the film is an ode to pop culture, as it's also a pioneer in introducing again the post-modernism. It's more than that. It is more than a homage, more than a plainly influenced art movie. It is obvious for everybody who has seen the film that it maintains a deeper meaning. Maybe not. But you thought about it, leaving the thought as an unfinished book on your shelf. The film follows a path of judgment while the main characters are absent from any foundation. They have a lack of value and they don't have a religion to follow. That depicts the tragedy of human nature and combines it with sneaky allusions. If anyone wants to learn more about the imagery and metaphorical significance of ""Pulp Fiction"", I'd like to suggest reading about nihilism and study philosophy.There is a lot more to say about Pulp Fiction. But it's a bit late. Don't forget to study philosophy. It will help."
28 August 2015,jwolf-77385,0,0,10,Not your Average movie,"One of my all time favourite movies from my childhood. First saw it when I was 6 and made such an impression for its unique film style. Multiple story lines broken and out of order makes it so different for it's time. Violent and plenty of drug/sex references without being in your face or obvious. The story of Vince and Jules and their boss doesn't sound interesting but with the unique style of Quentin Tarantino, it makes a great movie. At its simplest: it's about a crime boss who has a brief case stolen from him and sends his two best (Travolta and Jackson) to acquire the case. Nothing goes according to plan and people who'd never be involved normally get drawn in and involved. Feautring Bruce Willis, John Travolta and Sam Jackson. All time classic. Has created such a cult following and many a quote. A must watch."
6 September 2017,houssainesp,0,0,10,best Quentin Tarantino movie ever,"Quentin Tarantino is many things. Above all of them he is one of America's most important living directors. In a day and age when everything is a prequel, sequel or part of some tent pole, popcorn extravaganza, Tarantino is someone who has created his own tent pole extravaganza from scratch. He has his own genre: Quentin Tarantino movies. That he is able to make them personal and a piece of art in the process, is further testament to just how special this director is."
30 January 2016,me-22253,0,1,10,A Postmodern Masterpiece,"A critic of the film once told me, ""Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's most successful work at trying to say so much and at the same time saying nothing at all."" Of course, he wasn't wrong. It seems he didn't recognize the significance of the debut of postmodern film in Pulp Fiction. Film critics, movie buffs, and the like are often coming at the film from different angles, always asking the question, what does it all mean? Naturally the answer is absolutely nothing, and that is exactly what makes Pulp Fiction such a masterpiece.Tarantino has made a perfect film without having to make it about anything in particular. His dialogue draws the viewer in and captures their attention, placing them in the room, arguing and bantering alongside the characters which he has set in place. The various sub-plots are nothing if not unique, incorporating shocking events such as an adrenaline shot to the chest after a heroin overdose, a blown- up head leading to theological retribution, or Butch choosing to save his nemesis from his raper. The result is a film that is completely new, completely unheard of, and yet saturated with allusions, familiar faces, familiar music, and the timelessness of pop culture.Upon finishing Pulp Fiction, whether for the first time or the hundredth time, the feeling one often gets is satisfaction. However, every time, I find myself finishing the film and longing for conviction. It is this slight failure of the film to make you feel one way or another that leaves the viewer with a non-convicted feeling of satisfaction, after presenting such stark and shocking material. It is Tarantino's ability to not just make people feel something, but to make people want to feel something that they can't quite put their finger on which truly makes this film a postmodern masterpiece, not to mention a charming screenplay, bold cinematography, and an enthralling star-studded cast."
7 February 2016,hentaiemc,0,0,10,Blown Away,"My favourite movie for the longest time was Kill Bill (Both vol i + ii because I'm that kind of person) But as I sat down to watch my third Tarantino movie I had a worried feeling. I was concerned that I wouldn't like it at all. I have a pretty edgy sense of humour and I'm not really into serious movies. But as soon as the ending credits started rolling I had the biggest smile on my face. I was so pleased to discover that this was more than just a typical suit and gun movie. It's intricate plot and hilariously dark sense of humour are the reason it has topped Kill Bill for me. I loved every second of this movie and can't wait to watch it again. The acting was great, the story was great, the camera work was great and the soundtrack was great. Truly a masterpiece. As of now I have watched all 8 of Tarantino's movies and they have all succeeded my expectations. I never thought I'd grow an obsession for a guy with a foot fetish."

3 October 2005,julia-182,0,3,10,This movie is more then a masterpiece!,"This movie is perhaps the best ever. How can anyone think that Uma Thurman's ""square*"" is not genius? No, it is absolutely clear that they who think that this movie isn't good have either not been watching the movie or just didn't get it. I think that most movies that have the ""intertwine""-thing is boring, but in this movie it works so god damn well! One of the scenes I like the most is when Vincent and Jules talks about Europe and whats different there, like that in Paris, a Quarter Pounder with cheese isn't called a Quarter Pounder with cheese, but it's called a Royale with cheese. Quentin is clearly showing some of that amazing brilliance he's got. Okay, some of the scenes are quite disgusting, but maybe that has got it's charms too. I mean, you don't actually get to see the brain in the back of the car, you only see the splattering on the windows. This movie is a classic, a real classic, and I think everyone should have seen it at least once.* Square = Uma says ""Don't be a ..."" and she draws a little square with her finger."

The acting, the writing, the directing and the dark humor. I have a pretty twisted sense of humor which is probably the reason i love this movie so much. Some of my favourite movie moments come from this movie, like when Vincent shoots Marvin in the face and he just says, ""ah man i shot Marvin in the face"". That's brilliant directing, writing and of course acting from John Travolta.
I want to say thank you. Thank you to Quentin Tarantino, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and the other people who contributed to making this outstanding motion picture."

Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and a ton of other bad ass stars. I finally watched this on the weekend and my god this lived to my expectations, some people consider Pulp Fiction as the greatest movie of all time and it's hard to argue it.Vincet Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for a few days while Wallace will be out of town.Pulp Fiction put John Travolta back on the map as when he played an amazing role, This movie has so many memorable movie scenes from the scene with the briefcase to the dance scene with John Travolta and Uma Thurman, the opening scene is one of the best opening scenes I've seen, from the moment the movie started to when it ended I were on the edge of my seat and were excited to see what was going to happen next.Pulp Fiction does get pretty full on and there's some frightening scenes but that doesn't take away the fact that this is close to being my favourite movie of all time. This also shows the best performances I've seen from John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson because they kicked ass. all way through.I highly recommend Pulp Fiction to anyone who loves movies, this is my favourite movie and no movie will top this."

                        ",Great Movie,"Whatever you call it, Pulp Fiction is indisputably great. seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."

Quentin created a masterpiece, a classic before it had time to be one.The actors are perfect for the characters they play. First off, Samuel L Jackson is a legend. His character, 'Jules' is a perfectly crafted chap. With his gritty, blunt and exceptionally memorable lines he is one of, if not, the best character.As for Travolta he manages to create a wicked man. Not only in a sheer unrighteous manner, but as a good man. He is an outright villain.Altogether, the cast have made an awesome mixture of grit and steel, meat and bone, and fuel to fire in this savage concoction of twisted tales. A must see."

12 April 2006,tjh16,0,1,8,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction isn't your typical run and gun action film because it adds such detail in to the characters that you don't get in other mobster movies. The relationship between Vincent and Jules is particularly interesting in the way they both are of the same profession and can view events, like the shooting in the kid's apartment, completely different. Also the movie doesn't focus on just on aspect the whole film. I believe that the director realized that a typical mobster movie wasn't going to draw attention so he took a different approach. This concept of multiple stories is revolutionary expetionally in an action film, this is why the movie received much acclaim and why people liked the film so much. The aspect of the film that I liked the most was how you were still able to get an emotional response to a mobster movie, instead of just watching Pulp Fiction for just entertainment, you walked away from the movie feeling different, like you have accoplished something. One of my biggest critiques of the film is, Butch, played by Bruce Willis. You would expect an exceptional performance from Bruce, but I was let down by his menial acting in the movie. In all I liked how the movie flows and it didn't feel like just a waste of time."

Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point."

Espacially Sam Jackson, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel. The dialogues are written so damn good and espacially sam Jackson does a great job as Jules. The monologue in the apartment in the beginning is iconic. Every episode is so diffrent but still has this nice vibe of the movie. The monologue of ving rhames and the overall atmosphere of that scene with butch and vincent fits so perfect. It is one of the main reasons why it is my favorite movie. Also the brutality that is so characteristic for Tarantino movies doesn't seem to be overdone. Also one of the scenes that make this movie so great is the scne in the end in the restaurant.

30 November 2018,jenniaden,0,1,9,pulp fiction review,"My thoughts before we start
This movie is the movie that you record and then watch when there are no good movies on because you know that if you watch even if it is your 50th time watching it will still be good and pulp fiction may not be for but still thats why your reading this isn't it.
The Introduction
Pulp fiction opens up its story in a diner where a couple is talking about how to rob a bank and how easy it is getting to rob places and proceed to rob the diner that they are in. This tells you what kind of movie this is an indicator to a violent crime movie which is what it is and it rocks it. After it opens up to two hitmen going to complete a job and this is when the movie takes off
The characters
There are many main characters and you have to guess their names based off of what people call them. I am not going to tell the names of the characters because it doesn't matter. One of them is a boxer that takes money from a mob boss to lose and the winner and is on the run from him. There are these two hitmen and one of them quotes a bible verse all the time and the other is a italian guy who just got back from a job in france.
The action
There are many great action scenes in this movie there are scenes in cars and in houses and in torture chambers yes torture chambers also there are car chases and firefights and I sound like a little kid. Also I haven't mentioned all of the times people die in the movie and people die a lot so if mind that get out of here. The thing that is so great about pulp fiction action scene is that they are quick and straight to the point and I like that.
The End
At the end of the story it ends with one of the characters learning and well you can't have a better ending than that especially considering he was a hitman"
17 November 2005,kylopod,2014,2319,10,The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
12 November 2020,SebMoz,84,98,10,A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."
24 July 2014,gogoschka-1,273,342,10,The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
10 April 2020,gautammayya,150,176,10,The most rewatchable movie of all time,"Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.
As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh):
For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review.."

                        ","It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
13 January 2021,hockeydog-75085,82,103,10,Not overrated at all,Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.
6 November 2020,jaaanmerz,46,57,10,My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time."
20 January 2000,Quinoa1984,380,687,10,One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
21 April 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,28,42,8,"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
19 January 2005,discoelephant64,762,1239,10,Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."

7 December 2009,Hitchcoc,21,34,10,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?"

16 April 2020,DemonKiki,7,8,10,Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies."
9 February 2020,heisenberg12,11,15,9,Lightning in a Bottle,"So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece."

                        ",Awesome!,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
22 July 2020,terryzhangtianrun,4,4,10,Ezekiel 25:17,"The film written by Quentin is truly an astonishing masterpiece. This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie"
13 February 2012,hitchcockthelegend,29,51,10,"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
27 June 2014,Rainey-Dawn,14,22,7,A Bit Over Rated But Good,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"". Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10"
19 April 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,7,9,10,'And you will know my name is the lord!! When I lay my vengeance upon thee....',"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

13 March 2010,planktonrules,32,59,10,Brilliantly constructed.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis."
9 January 2005,wolvesrug,1054,1453,10,Simply The Best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
21 June 2019,pokemon_trainer_lucas,7,9,8,A fantastic classic,"I saw this film last year when my dad recommend it to me, and I was not disappointed even though it was made before I was born.

The characters and writing are great and iconic. Each story is interesting. The movie can go from intense to funny to just listening to people have a conversation in minutes or even at the same time. A very multi-genre movie and that adds to the rewatchability, you will catch new stuff each time and put pieces together on the multiple viewings. By the time the credits roll you will already be thinking about it and putting it together in your head. Very stylish when it comes to the great soundtrack and writing. Highly recommend, also has one of the best opening credit sequences."

25 December 2021,akdjreview,4,4,9,Lives up to the hype,"After hearing so many great things about pulp fiction I was intrigued. A story consisting of a bunch of smaller stories that interweave is an interesting concept. And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.The story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.With great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.The movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.I highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly."

The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pulp Fiction – Tempo de Violência"" (""Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence"")"

17 August 2006,Bologna King,256,519,5,Enormously Overrated,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."

Simply a timeless masterpiece that will forever be re-discovered by new generations."
18 December 2005,rowmorg,240,552,1,The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film,"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two."

Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention."

                        ",Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
16 January 2021,Grimbleton,5,6,9,You know what they call a 1/4 Pounder with Cheese?,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."
1 November 2020,theoledoux,6,8,10,Quality film making by a young Tarantino,"Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic."
9 October 2020,Bamboo1,5,6,10,Everything that Once upon a time in Hollywood wasn't.,"Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows1. Characters 112. Acting 103. Plot 74. Cinematography 105. World building 10We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s."
26 July 2020,flopezgraziano,3,3,10,this is a fantastic film,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time10/10"
20 July 2020,zeemaza,5,6,10,Perfection ... sheer perfection!,"Not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. From beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever. Really.Please see it."

I really liked the heavy use of drugs in this movie, it gave me tears of joy to see characters having the time of their lives on drugs and made me very nostalgic for my drug fuelled happy days as a youngster at Eton (Mess).The heavy use of drugs, violence, profanity and sex in this film has positively influenced an entire sexy generation of British people and I can't thank the United States enough for that, from youngish Brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the London Underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed British culture for the better, I'm so proud of the beautiful ex-British colony known as the United States due to this film.The sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the UK more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many Brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so I thank this film for making Britain a safer place for men. I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children."

11 December 2001,=G=,12,22,6,Sensationalistic crime flick missing one ingredient.,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"

Have we devolved into less-than apes?How and why does anyone rate this so highly, with an average of 8.9?People (men), (white men), are obsessed with playing the ""gangsta,"" drugs, sex, and using the f*bomb.This is good film??? Tarantino has been and continues to be a narcissist, and all of his fan boys like to tag along.As much as I hate the ilk of Tarantino, his film-making skills are of high value, so all is not lost - technically.STORY:
This ""story"" is a patchwork of stories, like what Tarantino does with his other films. Arguably the central story is
about two (2) hit men, but they are more like thread than fabric. The ""story"" isn't really a story with any kind of
valuable message (contrary to the fan boys); no, it's more like the ""days in the lives of people living in darkness.""The story has no intrinsic purpose or value - it's just white men wanting to (vicariously) play the ""gangsta.""ACTING:
This film has one (1) highlight - good acting. There is no character development (the director lacks this skill),
but the acting is clean, crisp, and the cast remain in character throughout.TEMPO:
The pace is somewhat appropriate for its genre (whatever that is), but it too often bogs down in itself (yes, like
the mythical Narcissus gets lost in his own self-affections).CINEMATOGRAPHY:
This is a reasonably well-scened film, but again, more like a ""day-in-the-life-of,"" so nothing special.DIRECTING:
Excellent skills, but I loathe the director.Overall, if you like watching people kill, torture, curse, use illicit drugs, and you really want to be a ""gangsta,""
then by all means ... watch this."
2 January 2021,jefadlm-1,7,10,10,"Hopefully some folk might learn a few things about film making , in my modest opine ?","I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its
style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?"

In fact this movie makes a new line in the cinema which is a collection between gangster's movies and dark comedy .It's different in his style and we can see this through it's intro and it's chapters that make you confused but still enjoying the film. No wonder that this film nominate for 7 Oscars and won one of them which is best original screenplay for Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino . If any one doesn't watch this movie yet.

16 February 2020,bellino-angelo2014,6,9,10,Perfectly made in every way,"PULP FICTION has a reputation of being one of the best movies of all time. It's #8 on IMDB's top 250, it has a score of 8,9 and it has tons of positive reviews. After seeing it nearly a month ago I told myself ''I was right!''The acting is excellent by everyone. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the highlights in the cast and this movie helped their careers a lot. Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable. The only complaint I have is that at times there are some violent moments, but since it's the only problem I cut it here.Since there are more than 2,800 reviews for this movie already I won't try to give a deep analisys or discussing the plot. Just watch it and enjoy."
6 August 2020,greatbun,6,7,10,Easy to recommend,"Praise for this movie is abundant in media, and rightfully so. Pulp Fiction is one of the most fun and satisfying movies I've ever watched. Being a Tarantino movie, its characters and dialogue are top notch. This is probably the #1 movie I would recommend to someone (if they haven't seen it) as it's very easy to get into and you can just let go of reality and be sucked into the film."

17 July 2008,CalDexter,100,224,1,Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."
9 April 2020,ChubbyChecker,6,8,10,If you only ever watch 1 Tarantino film make it this one,"I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"". Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction.I watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way.If you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction."

19 February 2001,brenttraft,45,99,2,Not very original,"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two."
29 April 2018,mrmystery99,12,19,10,"The More You Watch, The Better It Gets","Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing."

Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop.

The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."
17 July 2005,Tecun_Uman,286,671,1,A creative and slick waste of time,"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks."
7 October 2020,klastaitas,6,7,10,Pulp Fiction is Perfection,"After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself)."
4 January 2021,ringspeed,6,8,10,25 Years later on and still a masterpiece,"Some films date due to technology, fashion or political message. This film has none of it, just a unique combination of scenes bringing the best out of the characters.

5 August 2009,Jakemcclake,7,11,9,"Evil, Blood and Gore Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?""","Spoilers This movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things. We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back. We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character ""What?"" This is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close."

                        ",Classic Pulpy Amusement,"It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing."
23 December 2020,dashtag1234,4,5,9,One of the best written-films I have ever seen,"Tarantino (and Avary) put these stories together and created Pulp Fiction, which is the movie that shocked the world in 1994. It is hilarious, and brilliant writing. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson deliver two hilarious performances. The soundtrack is killer, and the directing is slick. It is a very quotable movie, and very memorable. The only ""criticism"" is that like all Tarantino movies, it goes on for a little too long, so it does get a little muddled in the middle. Overall, this movie is a blast."
9 July 2020,moviesknight,2,2,9,Wild chaotic and pulp fiction,"Tarantino's best work. The 4 tales going on and how he mingles them is good. Seeing the theological hints. The connection of Mia and Vincent was good. Going to extremes and tear things apart. How to correct mistakes and behave when things are going wrong. The respect for ones elders. Cashing on the chips when it matters, betrayals and the settlement. Acting and background score is great. Luck, honesty choice of free will, secrets and mistakes. Worth the time. What really was in the box is a secret though that makes it more interesting."
21 February 2002,LebowskiT1000,49,118,2,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!,"What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris"

                        ",Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable."
29 October 1999,Goon-2,56,129,1,I gave it a 1 out of 10,"That was to lower it's stupid ridiculously high average, but to put it quite simply, I hated this movie. I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch ""Short Cuts"" if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" for my least favorite ""good"" movie."
29 October 2020,Mcnabbbeasty,5,7,10,Profound Cinematic Transcendence.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is the classic of classics; Tarantino truly possesses the Midas touch. This 1994 masterpiece is brilliant in all aspects; from the ingenious writing to the wildly witty dialogue to its captivating character creation; the overall excellence of Pulp Fiction makes it not only among the best, but maybe the most rewatchable movie of all time. Nearly every scene is gold and crafted to divine perfection. Pulp Fiction is truly a remarkable feat in the art of filmmaking."
15 April 2020,saadanathan,8,14,8,"I dare you, I double dare you if you don't love this movie! 8/10","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all."
12 May 2016,the-fearless-america,5,7,10,"So nostalgic, superbly-acted, and so 90-stylish","This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day."

My Favorite Tarantino and arguably his best movie and one always highly enjoyable to view again and again.John Travolta steals the show after a dry spell in Hollywood and enjoyed a career renaissance shortly after.Excessively Violent and Funny. This one is a Must-Watch if not Must-Have!"
20 December 2015,cartesianthought,5,7,8,8 - Great,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue. This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."

                        ",Masterpiece of Characters and Dialogue,"Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age."
1 September 2019,UniqueParticle,5,8,10,Masterful even in a RPX theater,"Always a phenomenal experience especially the music and extremely well done acting! On par with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Kill Bill - Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies ever made! The scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta are so damn good plus the suspense bits give me goosebumps in the best way possible. The few parts with comedy are superbly marvelous, I'd love to be a famous writer one day even if its not as genius as Quentin Tarantino - He's top notch."
12 February 2022,MFC9,2,2,10,Game changer,"There aren't many films I remember watching on the big screen, but Pulp Fiction in 1994 was a red letter date. It was so unexpected, non-linear and unique, it absolutely blew me away. Watching it again nearly thirty years later, and it is still a masterpiece. Quentin has undoubtedly delivered films almost as good, but none better. 10/10."
4 October 2019,benowen-91207,5,7,10,*Insert Iconic Quote Here*,"Pulp fiction is... well it's pulp fiction. It gets everything right. I initially didn't think much of this film on a first viewing but it's slowly become one of my all time favourites (yes I know that's cliché)
This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this
You've already seen it, you've got the poster on your wall. This review will just be added to the masses but hey everyone 10/10 counts, right?"
3 April 2004,MovieAddict2016,8,15,8,Quentin Tarantino's second strike.,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.
There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5."

They are just trying to show that anything can happen at any time even at most unexpected time so be prepared for it. Everybody may not find it's worth watching.

11 August 2019,slightlymad22,8,15,9,Damn Near Perfect,"I just finished watching Pulp FictionTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.Pulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget)
At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year."
14 April 2021,motrous,2,2,8,Pulp Fiction,I'm not going to say anything new here. Not my favorite Tarantino movie but hard to argue that it didn't do a lot to change cinema. And it gave us Sam Jackson. Must see classic.
28 October 2001,cutter-12,28,61,1,A One line summary is too much for this overrated piece of #&#@!,"The movie that defines the sensibilities of Generation X. That is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with Christianity are twisted by Tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (Try watching some early Kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much ""originality"" Tarantino has.) I'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. Despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. It is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the Earth is from Neptune. Quentin Tarantino is NOT Orson Welles. And Pulp Fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. Make no mistake, I am more of an atheist than a Christian, but even I am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish Tony Minero would ice. If he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given Tim Roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. Off to a flawed start as a Christian. And the fact that Tarantino lets us see that Roth and Plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. Then there's the completely sickening LA underworld psycho scene (a personal Tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in Boorman's Deliverance. Does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? And if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving.Quentin Tarantino is truly one sick puppy. Sure, he DOES write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of MF and N words, but as far as talent for film-making goes he hasn't got an idea. He couldn't act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper (Spielberg gave a better performance in The Blues Brothers) and visually he has nothing to offer at all. If anyone knows his influences, and he speaks of them often, you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard (especially Howard Hawks) would phone the SWAT team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table.And to sum up my point, what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how GREAT a film Rio Bravo is. Before any more Gen X and y'ers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made, PLEASE see some other movies beforehand!!!!!!!!!!!!!Start with Citizen Kane."

There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected.

The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken.

I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P.A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into his other films, especially the Star Wars epics, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued..."

One of the most celebrated and acclaimed movies of all time is a damn masterpiece.Pulp fiction is one of my favourite films ever and for good reason:
-the amazingly genius nonlinear story telling
-one of the most enjoyable performances of all time from Samuel l. Jackson.
-and of course the dialogueLook, as someone who has seen all of Quentin Tarantino's great contributions to cinema history I can officially declare Pulp Fiction is still his best. After more than 25 years of being endlessly copied but never replicated there's a reason people still watch this movie so often.It's just so good."

2 December 2015,brianberta,6,10,9,Deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies."
18 December 2015,SnoopyStyle,8,16,10,Quentin Tarantino breaks out,Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.
22 April 2007,moonspinner55,6,11,7,"Kinetic and sneaky, narcotizing and primal...","Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****"
5 August 1998,Maniac-9,8,15,10,Most Innovative Film Ever,"Quentin Tarantino has proven to be the best director since Martin Scorsese came on the scene in the 1970's.  The movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames.  Plus the absolutely hilarious and cool scene with Christopher Walken telling Young Butch the importance of a gold watch."
2 May 2017,avik-basu1889,5,8,10,"Tarantino's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World !!!","This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."

18 November 2005,cfcpg,69,154,2,the most over valued film of the '90s,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
23 November 2015,robsta23,6,10,10,Redefining the Episodic Film,"This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0"
19 August 1999,Lil'Girl,65,146,1,Crass Fiction,"I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of ""humour"" isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point."
21 November 2019,jashminocha,5,7,9,"One of the most impactful, entertaining and mesmerizing movies i have ever seen in my life","Pulp fiction is a type of movie which makes a strong argument for the case that cinema is both art and entertainment. Pulp fiction is a highly entertaining movie filled with extra ordinary performances, talented actors and a very intelligent script. That's not to say that it is not an artistic cinema, today, the movie stands as one of the greatest movie ever made. With non linear narrative, powerful performances, excellent score and memorable dialogues which will stay with u forever, pulp fiction qualifies the rigorous beauty that is cinema.."
4 January 2001,sam_nas,76,176,2,I hate this movie,"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic."
9 December 2015,schroeder-gustavo,6,10,10,What is it about?,"Pulp Fiction made Quentin Tarantino who he is today. He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.Written and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.I'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.9.7/10"
21 July 1999,possum-3,57,121,1,Is revulsion now entertainment?,"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"
16 August 2008,DaveDiggler,22,46,9,"Violence and Redemption Underscore ""Pulp Fiction""","""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction."" Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. ""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways."

                        ","Hands down, the best film of the '90s.","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."

18 June 2007,Det_McNulty,10,19,7,"The Ultimate Slice Of Culturally Significant Pop-Culture. ""Pulp Fiction"" Is A Morality Piece Beyond Anything You've Ever Seen","Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"".Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar""."
11 April 2006,drystyx,8,16,6,Mildly amusing in parts,"Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though."
23 May 2022,margineanvladdaniel,4,6,7,Will the overrating stop?,"I thought that the ""best"" of Tarantino's work is this one, considering the fans and the rate, but it was not far from the others. I expected a better violence cinematography, but was bellow Once upon a time. It was better and it was the only thing I liked about it: the storytelling, but that's it. Most of the plots were predictable. I think most of the fans loved Samuel's character journey, but for me wasn't enough and impressing, a bit dull even. He almost deserved that Oscar nomination, Quentin too, but Uma and John weren't worthy. Their screen time were too short and inconsistent to be that praising as everyone does. Hateful eight, still my favorite and best of all. Change my mind! Peace!"
27 June 2019,HotToastyRag,10,22,2,I didn't get the point,"I know I'm not the only one who doesn't like Pulp Fiction, even though I wasn't able to find any like-minded people at film school. It's just not my cup of tea: excessive language, excessive violence, cheesy dialogue, strange visuals, and a story that's meant to be a throwback to old pulp fiction novels of the 1950s. If that is your cup of tea, you might love it!Famous for John Travolta's comeback, Uma Thurman's dancing, and Samuel L. Jackson's monologue about his favorite Bible passage, it's a tongue-in-cheek action drama about two hitmen, one of which falls for their boss's wife. There's quite a bit more to the story to that, so don't throw anything at me for condensing it as such, but it's told so out of order, and the movie is so long, it was practically impossible for me to understand anything more than that. At nearly three hours, even though I watched the censored version on television, I didn't get much more out of the movie than a ton of violence and some terrible wigs. I don't know why the dance scene became so famous; to me it looked incredibly stupid. Again, don't throw anything at me, but I obviously didn't get the point.If you do want to give it a shot, you'll see a huge supporting cast of Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, and Amanda Plummer. This is a highly acclaimed classic from the 1990s, but if you don't like it or don't even get all the way through it, you're not the only one.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
12 October 2020,aljabman,5,6,10,Pulp Fiction Is Not A Film,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."
25 December 2009,IcyRoses,119,291,1,Could Be Most Overrated Movie Of All Time,"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
7 June 2022,s0apt0ken,5,6,10,The greatest movie about absolutely nothing,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."
23 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,22,58,6,Love-Hate: Been There/Done That,"From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all."
20 May 1999,iron t,52,120,1,worst movie ever,"After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably."
14 March 2012,buiger,16,37,4,What's the big deal?,"I really don't know what the big deal is. This is obviously another one of those ""highly intellectual"" movies I am too stupid to understand. The critics compare it to ""The Godfather""... I find that to be sacrilegious! I agree with one critic only when he states that the film ""presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion"", and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims ""Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one..."" That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an ""in"" director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no ""higher"" meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either! If this is art nowadays, I want to go back to the past!"

27 November 2007,springsunnywinter,31,78,1,"The worst of the worst films I have ever, ever seen in the history of the planet, galaxy & the entire universe!!!","First of all my comment doesn't have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil. I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.I just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, ""You promised me no more rubbish films!"" He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs. Crap Fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place. First is either Jackass the movie 1 or 2.It is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams. That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10. This whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film."
23 June 2006,Li_85,12,26,8,Highly Overrated..Suppose to be a Gangster film???,"Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny."
19 September 2014,braddugg,6,11,10,It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.,"It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture. It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character. If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues. Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever."

                        ",Pulp Fiction. It is the REAL DEAL.,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"

8 July 1999,B RUBBLE,43,99,1,Terrible,This movie is one of the few that I nearly walked out on it was so bad.  It was too disjointed and I could not understand the point or plot.  People were killed in one scene and then popped up in another.  Lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plot.
6 November 2015,joshuafagan-64214,4,6,10,Stylistic Brilliance,"If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy."

                        ","Too long, too boring with poor story development","It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He ""played"" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip."
27 May 2012,Marc_Israel_365,8,16,9,"Ladies and Gentleman, fasten your safety belts as the cine-bar has been raised!","The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie. Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Jackson as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantino's use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as it's charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & company."
9 September 2006,cojosh,197,454,1,What??? Where??? Who Cares???,"Wow, a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!"
2 November 2014,georgios-christodoulou,99,192,5,I can't understand why this film got this high ranking!,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
4 April 2005,shattenjager777,24,55,2,"Some hilarious scenes, but nothing else to offer","Quentin Tarrantino is in general better known for the amount of violence in his films than any merits they have, and after seeing ""Pulp Fiction,"" I can see why. The film had an extreme amount of violence, yes, but it had few merits. The stories were none too original or exciting and the final attempt to connect them was completely unsuccessful and really brought to the fore what a disconnected, nonsensical mess the entire film is.The characters are flat and dull, the dialogue is made up of about six total words, five of which cannot be used on network television, the stories aren't exciting, and those stories have an attempted connection that doesn't really connect them. Tarrantino seems to have been playing around with time and non-linear narrative, but the film barely, if at all, made any sense. There seems to be no reason for anything that happens and the unusual narrative, rather than drawing the viewer in, is beyond Tarrantino's (the writer) abilities. Further, Tarrantino draws no interesting characters--even with two skilled and charismatic leads in Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. The most interesting character is definitely that of Butch the boxer, and even he is little-defined.The performances of all involved were fine, since the characters required so little, highlighted by Bruce Willis (oddly enough) and Samuel L. Jackson and lowlighted by the ever-horrible Patricia Arquette, who can do more to ruin an easy character than any actor I have ever seen this side of Kevin Costner and Patricia Clarkson. The parade of stars seemed to be Tarrantino's attempt to distract from the film, but it wasn't successful, since most of the actors were people who have horrible taste in general (Mr. Travolta, that's your call) and this was like a concatenation of all their wrongdoings.Meanwhile, Tarrantino the director does not distinguish himself in one way or another. It's a fairly standard-looking film that doesn't jump out of the mainstream at all, which was actually rather effective since the violence then seemed much more commonplace, but I don't know that it was Tarrantino's intention. I think if he intended that sort of theme, he would have used a more close up-laden style, so I doubt that he intended to be dull.The film's few redeeming moments were packed near the end, with a hilarious scene of Bruce Willis choosing a weapon with which to kill some tormentors and a look on his face at the end of said scene that is absolutely priceless leading the pack, but a few other good comic moments come near the end and perhaps make up somewhat for the mess that came before them.Overall, I consider ""Pulp Fiction"" a terrible mess of a script with no characterization, bad dialogue, a wildly disconnected story, and no reasons for anything that was directed decently if not well and enacted as well as possible considering its horrendous flaws. The film is most certainly not the masterpiece it is made out to be; it is more the accident it least wants to be. I would suggest it if you don't mind violence and want a good nap, but that's it."

Really?,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"
26 April 2020,yiwanir,7,9,10,"Hands down, my favorite film of all time.","I don't think I can describe in words the immense impact Pulp Fiction (and as a matter of fact, all of Tarantino's work) has had on me both as a person and a filmmaker. It's brilliant, it's exciting, it's fascinating and extraordinarily executed - it's everything a film should be. Watching Pulp Fiction just brings me true joy, in a way that no other film is able to - it fulfills the purpose of art, in my opinion, to the highest degree."
13 May 2016,Emmajoy93,5,7,10,Very brilliantly shot film,"Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film."
14 December 2015,Lukec1229,6,9,9,Pulp Fiction (1994),"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once."

26 May 2003,ivony,6,10,10,What a thrill ride!,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars."
10 March 2015,crendine,56,138,1,Pulp Trash,"I have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed, overly and unnecessarily violent, and just plain difficult to understand. I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film."

Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing."

His ability to place the audience in the middle of a crazy story and wrap it up at the end deserves recognition. This Film is full of amazing actors who make everything work beautifully. It is so hard to choose which character did the best job because their was so many. Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion did the best. Watching this film for the first time requires a lot of attention as well as applause. The Cinematography was excellent and the ability for scenes to flow in such a way really is a work of art. Definitely a 9 out of 10 if not a perfect 10. Nothing can be changed to make this film better."
24 June 2011,digdog-785-717538,8,16,10,"The Most Important Film,Ever","It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.John Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas. Pulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction. Mastery in work, spark of genius, there is no way that this film can be any less than 10/10 and the best film ever made."

                        ",Quentin Tarantino's Magnum Opus Is Cinematic History In The Making,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Multiple viewings advised."

2 September 2002,kyle_c,7,13,10,**** out of ****,"Interweaving three stories about small time gangsters, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved to be one of the most interesting, original, and entertaining films of the last fifteen years.  Using Tarantino's characteristic dialogue, in which the characters speak about everyday things rather than just the plot, the movie creates a light atmosphere, counterpointed by moments of extreme violence and intensity.  An infusion of many classic genres, such as noir, it manages to put a new spin on many old cliches.  A must see for any  appreciator of cinema."

29 May 2019,jackamccallum,5,7,10,Deserves all the praise.,"Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life."

I found no humor anywhere, only lame philosophy wrapped up in glorified criminal activities.  I for one am glad that Forrest Gump won the Oscar over this load of bull.  I have never been able to watch anything with John Travolta or Bruce Willis since this came out, and it took me awhile to forgive Samuel Jackson for this movie as well.  Tarantino should never have been allowed to direct again.Skip this crap and rent something else, or you might lose respect for the actors involved.  I sure did."
7 June 2005,Mighty_sheman,110,268,1,"Pointless, immature and excessively crude glorified action film from the world's most pointless, immature and excessively crude man!","Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts  Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the  two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare  vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly  revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the  very existence of modern society.  There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion,  the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's  director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start  to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an  untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The  only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a  collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely  together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude,  made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse,  accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as  cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a  highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art'  piece is doubly irresponsible.  Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth.  There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to  perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they  perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to  what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly  likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from  perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer  and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the  film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where  an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the  'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring  Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia  herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film  throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be  developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch)  or their actions performed by a completely new character without making  a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the  subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who  is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is  the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage'  (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill  where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit  to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of  plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could  disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was  written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job  narrative structure enhanced the story.  The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at  times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to  mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames)  uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The  only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the  ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a  flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue  which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is  unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots  talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers,  milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some  coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but  mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with  such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking  about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring  brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no  substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they  all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the  ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance.  The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to  justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant  to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which  consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no  actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with  any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care  even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless  monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the  briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it  beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character  that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it,  combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it.  Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion  because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some  have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings  that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has  somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As  a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself  but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the  exception."

9 November 2008,Sergeant_Tibbs,4,7,8,Great film.,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10"
18 August 2002,the_mad_mckenna,7,13,10,Royale with Cheese,"I first saw Pulp Fiction on a bootlegged copy on VHS while it was still in theatres, which was funny due to the fact it still had the segment where Mia Wallace ""interviews"" Vincent before their date on a video camera. How surprised I was to see it in a theatre and see the scene missing. Quentin tacked it onto ""collector's edition"" VHS copies later on.The reason I watched it on video first was that I was sure I'd hate it; instead, it's unique, funny, touching, profane, cringy (hello, zed!) and flat out a great ride all the way. This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing. Sam Jackson also pulls off a career best performance - not everyone could deliver those lines from the Bible and make them sound as menacing and convincing."
4 January 1999,Vegie,49,117,1,I love violence and language but this is an excessively crude film from a show-off video store clerk turned director.,"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."
9 October 2013,roth81,18,38,3,Pretty bad!,"The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!"
11 March 2021,yusufkaanatanur,2,2,10,The Rebirth of Storytelling,"No matter which way you try to look at it, this picture is a masterpiece. The angles are nice, the cinematography is strong, the acting is good, the soundtrack is unmatched but the most important thing this film offers is its storytelling. The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal ""Guy wants something, gets it"" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like ""The Trio"" or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something. This revitalised, superb storytelling, when combined with Tarantino's more down to earth dialogue and imagination, gives us the classic film that is Pulp Fiction."
14 September 2019,SimonJack,5,10,2,"Blood, guts and garbage talk doesn't entertain this movie buff","The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of ""Pulp Fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.""Pulp Fiction"" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting."

What am I missing here?,"As someone who first watched it in 2017, I don't see why this is in the top movies list, and that first part of the sentence might be the reason why.This movie's formula: ridiculous early 90's clothing, lots of foot fetish undertones, coked up dumb sluts who'd shove anything up their nose like toddlers, and men being killed in pointlessly excessive ways. Trying to glorify cliché black gang ""culture"" and mafioso themes. Weird, occasionally charming but unfitting jokes. Smoking in almost every scene. Insanely long intro sequence. Just as pointlessly long and non-engaging scenes that offer no substance, nothing to get you interested in what they're talking about, just casual chatter stretched over 2,5 hours. I couldn't finish watching it.My only guess is that some parts of the movie were considered ""badass"" at the time, it's 23 years old after all, which is why people are so looking at it trough nostalgia glasses. But it definitely doesn't hold up. And my movie expectations are already as low as ever, since nowadays most movies are utter crap. Some of Tarantino's more recent movies at least had some things going for them - gore, humor, cheesiness so cringy that it kind of makes you like it. But this one - doesn't hold up.None of the characters, except maybe John Travolta's are likable or interesting. There was nothing to keep me watching this. As soon as it switched to Bruice Willis' storyline I had to check out. That was just like watching a boring couple trough a hidden camera having a normal day. Wasn't this supposed to be a crime/drama movie? The ""interesting part"" never seems to begin. The acting was pretty corny and unbelievable as well.Overall feels like a low-budget ""avant garde"" movie shot as a school project, but I know it's far from that. That's just how it looks and feels like.I wanted to like it, but it just can't happen. I thoroughly enjoyed movies from as far as 60 years ago, so age can't excuse it, it was just too focused on that time frame and those cheesy, bland topic points. I don't blame Tarantino, it was one of his early movies, I'm just spellbound at how this movie is so highly rated.People seem to look too deeply for meaning where there is none. And the nostalgia glasses, take them off, it's been 23 years."

If someone wants to sit down in front of a tv after a exhausted day and wants to watch something to lighten his mood , then this is a perfect movie for you my friend .This movie is technically good too. The way Tarantino wrote a clever script and tied his audience with a movie with such an ordinary story, is really impressive . The acting, humor, violence and use of music is top notch. And last but not the least Uma Thurman ,THE BEAUTY!!!!"
13 July 2020,thenameisjj,5,6,10,Wish I had seen it sooner.,I've heard about this film for years. I always pushed it away because I thought old films weren't really my thing. They were always so raw but too long for me. But pulp fiction has to be one of the best films. I have never seen such a comedic and raw movie that would keep me at the edge of my seat. The fact that the first scene fitted so well with the last scene is amazing.

31 January 2002,yarborough,13,30,2,Yet another disgrace by Tarantino.,"Quentin Tarantino so obviously has no ability for creating a decent story in his movies (see my ""Reservoir Dogs"" review) that for this one he chose to give it a title that would excuse its ridiculousness. As I said in my ""Reservoir Dogs"" review, the man is hopelessly plot driven, which means that he can't create a story in which events naturally happen, so he has to MAKE them happen any way he can. For instance, it's bad enough that in ""The Gold Watch"" he creates a pathetic excuse for Bruce Willis to have to go back to his apartment, but then how could he make it so that Willis is able to outwit John Travolta, who is waiting there for him? Have Travolta idiotically leave his machine gun on the counter while he is using the bathroom! Come on! And then in ""The Bonnie Situation,"" how could he make the accident in the car happen? Have Travolta completely unnaturally rest the gun on the car seat over his shoulder while he talks with Marvin! And Tarantino introduces the Wolf only for him to give Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson obvious advice for how to solve their problem while he mouths off humorous comments. Anyone wonder why Tarantino has disappeared now? Because he used up all the unoriginality he had."
14 May 2018,WubsTheFadger,5,9,9,Pulp Fiction,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerPulp Fiction is a film that must be seen. The story is cleverly put together and elegantly flows from character to character. The story is funny, brutal, disturbing, and memorable. The story is told in a nonlinear fashion and requires the audience to pay attention. Tarantino has created some of the most complex characters in cinema. They all have personality and are relatable in various ways. The dialogue between the characters is amazing. The ending is stunning.The acting is very good. Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Amanda Plummer, and Ving Rhames all perform extremely well. They all give their characters a certain flair and keep the story going with their individuality.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is justified because Tarantino builds his story and characters slowly.The amount of cursing in this film is, in my opinion, unneeded. I found the extent of the swearing excessive. The use of violence is perfect though.Pros: Elegantly told story full of memorable moments, a lot of funny moments, amazing characters, great dialogue, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good use of violenceCons: Excessive cursing and the runtime can be long for someOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. Pulp Fiction is a classic that should be experienced by all movie watchers. I would recommend being over the age of 18 because there are a lot of sexual situations and dialogue."

I'm sure everything has been said already, so I'll keep this review short.'The Twist' scene with Travolta and Thurman was courageous film-making from a young director, and it took even more courage to include it in the final version of the film. At the end of the day, if we don't all agree that 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was genius, then Tarantino looks arrogant and we all point to that scene as an example of a has-been actor and an over-rated young director. Instead, I watch that scene and hold my breath, because even without dialogue, Tarantino used two cameras to make magic on the screen for those few minutes. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film - bold & brilliant.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

27 September 2021,TheHonestCritic,4,7,4,"A masterpiece? Or, just another overrated mess?","""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), when I was in college, almost every single day I went to class, someone would mention this ""movie"". They mentioned it so much, that it finally became comical. Eventually, I gave in and I decided to take a look at it and see what all the fuss was about. (I really ought to stop doing that!) Even before I started college, I knew just how overrated it was. Sure enough, I was right! This ""film"" has a convoluted and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a dull soundtrack to attempt to tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is about the lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster, his wife, and also a pair of diner bandits whose stories are intertwined in four different narratives. Yes, it's just as jumbled and confusing as it sounds. Right off the bat, the storyline is way too complex. Plus, to make matters worse, it's told out of chronological order. I suppose it wasn't confusing enough! That being said, there are a few different films out there that showcase it's storyline out-of-order that have been done a whole lot better than this ""movie"". A perfect example is, ""Memento"" (2000). That one was told in a random fashion. However, as the movie progresses the big picture is gradually revealed and it makes sense. However, ""Pulp Fiction"" is essentially ""Memento"" done wrong. Since the story is told out-of-order, it amounts to nothing but confusion, too many plot threads and no morals. It's basically just a bunch of uninspired dialogue and violence without a message. Look, I'm all for that. Had it been told in sequential order, it may have been more on the right track. But, deciding to put it in random order just shot this ""film"" in the foot! Some of the dialogue was so stupid, that it didn't even feel real. Wow, I never thought I would say something like that about a movie! There's one scene where our main characters are discussing a Big Mac sandwich. Why? It serves no purpose and it amounts to nothing. There are many scenes like that, but that one is probably the most unnecessary. To tell you the truth, that's the best word to describe this ""film""; unnecessary! I was not invested for one minute, nothing appealed to me, it wasn't entertaining, it was not coherent and it dragged on for way too long. Film Making 101: if you're going to write and produce a movie with an out-of-order plot, you better be sure you know what you're doing. You need to be an expert to craft such a complex story! As for the acting, it's just as mangled as the plot. Here we have an all-star cast, and all of them went to waste. What a shame! The cast includes: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis and even more. When I saw the cast list, I was excited and thought: ""with all of this acting talent, they can't possibly screw it up!"" But somehow, they actually did. None of their performances could save this poorly written and conceived ""movie""! It's almost like they were told to forget that they were actors and just limp their way through, hopefully equating to a performance. No, you need effort, otherwise, you get lazy acting as a result of forced and tired film making decisions. The soundtrack is about as random as you can get. Fun-fact: this is one of those few movies where there is no traditional film score. They use mainstream music for it. Sometimes that can work, and sometimes it can't. Granted, there are a few songs in this ""movie"" that I do like. But even then, they just sounded like they were added in at the last second haphazardly. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are very well-done and still hold up today. They may get a little cheesy at times, but overall, they have aged very well. ""Pulp Fiction"" is yet another major disappointment in the world of somehow praised cinema. I just don't see what the hype is all about. It did next to nothing for me, yet, people love it for some reason. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""Pulp Fiction""! Unless you like mindless violence and stupid dialogue, avoid this ""movie"" like the plague. All you'll get is confusion, but thankfully, it's just a pointless work of pulp fiction (what a dumb title)!"

                        ","Love it or hate it, but I give it ""5"" of 10 for style!","Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about ""content"" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for ""interweaving 3 different stories."" Ever watch the TV series ""Northern Exposure?"" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various ""philosophical discussions"", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as ""Longitude"", ""Nixon"", ""Apollo Thirteen"", ""Amistad"" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Matrix"". Or thought-provoking ones such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""Lone Star"", or ""Good Will Hunting"".I give low ratings to such films as ""The Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do."

It got the most perfect soundtrack, i grew up with it actually, my dad bought it when it came out and i've heard the songs from time to time, and now when i saw it recently it all came back to me. This movie got me one step closer for me to like Quentin Tarantinos work even more. The movie was so great and the actors also. Loved everything in it, the cars , the weapons, the theme itself actually. This movie is a classic that will never die, people will remember it in 100 years from now. And Quentin Tarantino will be remembered also. The movie was not to short and not to long in my opinion, but unfortunately it had some slow parts in it, which is why i didn't vote 10/10 on it."

In fact it undercut any feelings one could have for the characters and made the movie far more tedious then it had to be. The first half is merely dull and boring.Then it becomes ugly, gross, vicious and disgusting. It ends up being forgettable and sickening.Out of the 5,0000 movies and 50,000 television episodes I have seen in my life, this would rank about #8 in the 10 worst.

There was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it, and the overly gratuitous use of the f-bombs put me off completely. It's almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue. I felt like Tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is, but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story, I might have liked it more. The only person he's impressing is himself, and it isn't working."

Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.

Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."

                        ",Not Something I'd Praise As A Great Movie,"OK first of all I saw this a little while ago and I don't see how anybody could like this film except for the stars: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Peter Greene, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames. The plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand. The Characters are all technically bad guys. Like I said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting. Overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told, the characters are all unlikable. I really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten, this is it! I mean just how it got as high as an 8.9 out of 10 is beyond me. I'd continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isn't worth anymore time. Please if you're wanting to see a great crime film go watch Goodfellas(1990) and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the Hunted(2003). This film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but Mars Attacks is way better and that was a comedy film!!!"
8 January 1999,pro-andy,4,6,10,Tarantino+Travolta=the best ever,This movie is the best that ever has been made.John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are outstanding and Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors in the world.I also think that this movie should have won the academy award.Everything in this movie is great.I´ve seen it about 20 times and it gets better and better every time.
15 October 2008,kurciasbezdalas,4,7,10,One of best movies ever made,Right now I can't find right words to describe this movie. I used to think that Jackie Brown is a best Quentin Tarantino's film but this movie has a much deeper meaning than Jackie Brown. You have to watch really intently to understand it. I realized how clever this movie is by watching the last scene. There is a lot of interesting dialogs which may appear pointless but they are not. There is a lot of memorable moments and interesting characters. The soundtrack is great. This movie was considered to be very violent but actually there wasn't much violence (in one episode of Oz you can see more violence than in this film). This movie is really worth your time.

I personally think this is the film that made Samuel L. Jackson as this crazy badass. This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this. This really is a true original, some complain that this film is a bit overrated but let me tell you this deserves to be overrated. Yeah sure there is no deep message behind this movie, but who cares.9.4/10"

I watched this at the recommendation of my friends, who both said that it was a brilliant film, and that it had very hilarious scenes.  I found no humor, no plot, and no point to this trash.  Shame on Sam Jackson for starring in this piece of trash, as well as everyone else who appeared in this film.  Tarantino should never be allowed behind a camera again!Avoid at all costs....you may lose respect for the actors involved. I sure did."

Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.I give it an easy 10/10"
26 August 2010,wwe7961,4,7,10,An amazingly entertaining movie.,"This film is throughout an extremely entertaining, funny, and very well written. The dialogue in this movie is easily the best ever. Scenes of two people talking in this movie are better than any action scene they could have thrown at us with this movie. The characters are all extremely memorable. This film in my opinion without a doubt qualifies as one of the best films ever made, and definitely one of the most entertaining also. Acting from everyone is great, but you can't beat Jackson's ""And you'll know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thy."". This film is an entertaining film that is sure to please those who want to watch it, and many of those who don't.4 stars out of 4"
18 May 2016,Horror-yo,7,16,5,"Extraordinarily overrated, but a fun watch","This is by no means boring, but by no means 'essential' or intelligent or really worthwhile at all. It's a very fun watch, hence the 5 points out of 10 I will concede it. But yet it is void of any meaning whatsoever and benefits from a contemporary society that will erect any piece of meaningless junk into a grande piece of art solely on the basis it is 'original'. Originality on its own is no virtue. There needs to be purpose, meaning, a particular sense of coherence and overall an intelligence to it. All things this movie surely lacks. The script is quite awful and tries hard at being edgy and memorable for how random and 'original' it is. This film is constantly patted on its back for being structurally and cinematographically complex and 'original', but that never makes up for how skin-deep and hollow inside it so clearly, evidently is. Acting is good, and it's pretty diverse; a succession of little stories somewhat interlinked. A good watch for purely entertainment purposes, but nothing more. And certainly not a masterpiece."

8 August 2004,didi-5,10,27,4,pulp trash that put Travolta back in the money,"The world of movies did not begin and end with 'Pulp Fiction' and Quentin Tarentino is not a genius.  That aside, and taking this movie as what it is, a penny dreadful on the screen, it does become perversely enjoyable. 
There's the cafe where 50s idols serve dinner (Buddy Holly, Marilyn Monroe, Mamie Van Doren, Jayne Mansfield) and where Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta, undergoing a renaissance after years out in the cold) dance the twist to Chuck Berry's 'It was a teenage wedding ...'.  There's Vincent's hip black partner Jules (a sleek and cool Samuel L Jackson), and the town's big guy - and Mia's husband - Marcellus (Ving Rhames).  And then there's Butch, who gets the film in an interesting twist part way through, and he's Bruce Willis, who was everywhere the time this movie got made.And there's the inept hold-up duo - Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer - as 'Ringo' and 'Honey Bunny', the really chilled Mr Wolf (Harvey Keitel), and a cameo from Tarentino himself as Jimmie.  Does all this mean the movie is any good? Well, there's a body in a car without a head, and an o/d to Urge Overkill's 'Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon', and Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.  It's a comic party with f words.  Salivating kids may boggle at this and call it the most influential film ever - it isn't, but it is one of the most referential.  'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Jackie Brown' didn't come close, and 'Pulp Fiction' is, for what it's worth. QT's best to date."

It all started when two hit men are on their way to receive a suitcase and see their man. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson stars in this riveting and explosive crime drama about four tales about violence and redemption. Quentin Tarintino, who directed Reservior Dogs in 1992, takes four tales and makes a classic gangster tale. The movie is packed with screwy dialogue and extreme surprising characters. My reaction? My reaction was that Pulp Fiction was that it was funny, exciting, thrilling and excellent. Pulp Fiction was a worldwide explosion with audiences and critics saying the movie is fun, thrilling and funny throughout. I sat through Pulp Fiction one night watching it on AMC and I thought, this movie is fun. It's cool and crisp. At the end, it was all-out conclusion. Though the stories are out of sequence, it still can be fun without knowing characters in random areas. The movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

                        ",Overrated.,"Seriously. I mean, this film is mildly amusing, and I saw it at the theater when it first came out. But I really can't watch the whole thing repeatedly, like with some true classics. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 5, or even really the top 100.Both Reservoir Dogs and True Romance are better films, even just examining the Tarantino Ouvre. The Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene (and the Pimp-fight scene) from True Romance alone blows this film away.In all, I think this is ultimately a case of the emperor not wearing any clothes. If you watch these three films in one weekend, you should clearly see that PF is the weak link of the bunch. Its success appears largely a product of buildup from the earlier films, along with the desire of people to appear hip and cool, both then and now."
5 May 2004,Chimale1025,38,90,1,A Big Stinky Mess of (place epithet here),"This film typifies what is wrong with the whole film world today. When a morally bankrupt,intellectually challenged creep like the ""director"" of this piece can get a deal with a major studio it says a lot about the sad and pathetic state of movie making. The level of hype surrounding this and the other (place epithet here) made by this twerp is disgusting. What drugs are being passed around in Hollywood board rooms? I'd really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was. I saw this (place epithet here) and I was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience. Getting high on violence is a good thing? Tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world. Good film making technique aside, are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of (place epithet here) represents? This is just (place epithet here) elevated to Olympian ""ART FILM"" status. The presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of Hitchcock ""are cattle"". This, and the previously mentioned disease's other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that Hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with (film school critic retards included). This is only my opinion, but I know other cinema literate people who share it. The fact that this was nominated for Oscars is too abhorrent to bear.

The overall experience was great as you can really connect with the different characters and quickly get sucked into the movies plot.

15 May 2000,KFL,8,18,3,"Awful movie, despite the clever script","Movies can either entertain or edify; ideally, they do both. Pulp Fiction failed to entertain me. Perhaps that's just me. I grant it's funny in places, but I couldn't manage laughter in the middle of a homosexual rape, a gangland hit, a drug overdose, a kid getting his head blown off, etc. I suppose I must be abnormal in some way.Does it edify? It makes many references to other films; I don't think that counts. It shows us (several times) how crucial timing can be in visiting the restroom. No, I don't think that's it either. Some say it's about the ""redemption"" of the Jackson and Willis characters. Whatever redemption may have taken place seems very superficial and unconvincing.On the positive side, several of the performances were brilliant. The screenplay is undeniably clever.

I've been debating on this or Once Upon a Time In Hollywood for a while but the pure classic genius of this just had to take spot number 2. I mean I shall now and attempt to actually analyse the brilliance of this movie now that I've got the subtext out of the way. Structure-wise, writing-wise, soundtrack-wise, character-wise, action-wise and slickness-wise it gets all fucking right. All of these things just make a perfectly peculiar yet divinely beautiful amalgamation that crates the most unique vibe. The main thing with Pulp Fiction is vibe and how it makes you feel. It's not uplifting but it makes you smile, it's the prime example of style and substance. But I couldn't really describe the substance part to you because I mean I wasn't in my feels but I was invested, I was so invested in every single one of these characters even if they were dicks and even if they were only on screen for one screen. I think this is because Tarantino is brilliant at showing you real people, I mean they're in extreme and probably unrealistic situations but they're real people who talk about real things and that sits with you.

25 August 2006,pyrocitor,4,8,10,"Twisted, perversely funny, captivating - a cornerstone of modern film-making","When a previously unknown young filmmaker named Quentin Tarantino barged onto the movie-making scene in 1992 with a unique, quirky, disturbing and groundbreaking film called Reservoir Dogs, a noticeable change could already be seen soon after in the film industry on the whole. Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit ""True Romance"", also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators. Despite the relentless praise Tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, Pulp Fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. No matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. One also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the Simpsons, Saturday Night Live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with Travolta and Thurman,the ""you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?"" scene with Jackson and Travolta and Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources. The movie truly defines the meaning of the term ""ensemble cast"" as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. John Travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like Vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star Samuel L. Jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their Oscar nominations. Tarantino favourite Uma Thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and Bruce Willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer Butch. Then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and Christopher Walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time. All in all, it goes without saying that Pulp Fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. For those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be Tarantino trademarks, Pulp Fiction should qualify as a ""must see"", if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. Rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed. -10/10"

                        ",A scriptwriters dream,"I initially saw this movie because there was alot of talk and press at the time the movie came out. It brought back Travolta's career. Look at the load of movies he pulled out in the 90's after this. And it put Samuel on the map for good. It also acknowledged other underrated great actors.This isn't my favorite movie and I would never have to see it again. It was very disturbing to watch but very real. This movie also went against Hollywood's usual conduct of restraint. This movie had no restraints.I can't even give a summation of the story, but I applaud Q. Taratino for his artistic merit. He is very innovative and different. This movie was based on content, originality and style. I personally thought his best work was True Romance, From Dusk till Dawn, and Resorvoir Dogs. The key is in the script writing. He focuses on real characters with real dialogue. Not the cheesy kind and isn't afraid to touch racial/social differences that may be offensive. I truly think he is one of a kind and Pulp Fiction proved that."
26 November 2005,krorie,4,8,10,The Definitive 90's Film,"Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie ""Momentum"" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented ""Pulp Fiction"" when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands ""Pulp Fiction"" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.Vincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.Although there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.Each decade has movies that define the era. Think of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" for the 1950's or ""Casablanca"" for the 1940's. For me ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's ""No Exit"" doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.Tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end."

Jackson and John Travolta followed by gorgeous and catchy dialouge of QT (i.e. ""I just shot Marvin in the face!"")that never lets down on the viewer. Heed the definition of ""pulp"" that's at the beginning of the movie, otherwise you might walk away a little disappointed. Weather you're in the mood for action, comedy, drama, or all of the above this movie will deliver with satisfaction."
18 August 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,6,15,10,"It's sick, it's twisted, and f****d up... I LOVE IT!","I'm not sure why, but I really loved this film. There is no reason, I just loved it. My sister told me that if I liked ""Kill Bill"" than I should enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"". I noticed that it was also #16 on the top 250. How could I say no to that? I am not a huge Quentin Tarentino fan, to let everyone know. I know there is a huge die hard fans who can't stand if he is bad rapped. I am not one of those people. But! I do think the man has talent that people reconize almost immidatley. All of his films are on the top 250 if you haven't noticed.
The film isn't for everyone. You have to be in a certain mood to watch it. It is pretty sick, so, it's not for everyone. But I would recommend if you love action flicks.10/10"
17 March 2006,rebeljenn,5,11,7,great method of story-telling,"'Pulp Fiction' scores extra stars for setting up an original way of story-telling. The story is told from end to beginning (well, sort of), and it follows a few characters who get caught up in some misunderstanding or mess involving crime or criminal. Thoroughly engaging but often warped and funny, this film is a pleasure to watch. In the final scenes, the viewer learns how the different stories of the characters are connected, bringing an even closer meaning to the film. 'Pulp Fiction' is very creative in its story-telling method. That is what makes this a good film, and without it, this film would be dull and like any other film."
2 December 2003,movieguy1021,4,8,9,Pulp Fiction: 9/10,"Controversy is usually good for movies. It's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and I think that that is one of the ways Pulp Fiction has become so immensely popular. I've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. So I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug usewell, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.Pulp Fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays Butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, Marcellus gets Jules and Vincent to whack him. Along the way, Vincent has to take Marcellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out, and along the way she OD's. Got all that?There is one thing that Tarantino can do that no one else I've seen can do efficiently. He can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. Christopher Nolan first tried it in Following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in Memento. However, there, he held our hand throw it, while Tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. That adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in Pulp Fiction. Each character is memorable, especially Jules, who quotes from the Bible right before killing someone. It's just a very hip experience.Pulp Fiction cheerfully takes clichés, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. Like what Kill Bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, Pulp Fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. Also, it's a trendsetter. The classic dance scene between Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where Vincent and Jules are talking about McDonalds' Quarter Pounders.In addition to the layer of coolness, Pulp Fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. I'm sure some of the parts I laughed at were just because I wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe I just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence.Everyone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. The only reason that Pulp Fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with Butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. Knowing me, though, I'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's.My rating: 9/10Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality."
25 August 2013,dragokin,7,17,6,nomen est omen,"When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme d'Or cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line i've seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times."

                        ",Most over-rated movie I've ever seen,"I have only seen this movie once, during the original theatrical release, so maybe I'm due for a second viewing, but I just don't get it.  Yes, it's misogynistic, racist, hyper-violent, and near as I can tell --devoid of any redeeming social value: but these seem to be the high points!  Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be ""What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?"" !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?  I wouldn't object to the violence so much if it made me think (The Matrix, Memento) or feel (Road to Perdition) something, but unfortunately, this film offered me neither."
26 January 2005,Phracture,38,88,2,Appeal is a Complete Mystery!,"The overwhelming praise for this film is beyond my comprehension. While it has a handful of darkly funny moments, and a fair splash of style, it's episodic, tasteless, sometimes downright disgusting, and far too quirky to make a good film.It has so many elements critics decry at every opportunity as the things which prove ""holywood"" is completely out of touch with it's audience that it brands most as hypocritical. Seems to prove it's not the sex, drugs, violence, and vulgarity that critics actually object to, but simply the package they come in.This is basically dreadful sludge masquerading as hip!"
27 July 2002,joseayarza,6,12,10,"Overall a great film, but...","OK, I loved this film. LOVED IT. But it's not perfect. The main problem with the movie is that the best scene is at the beginning: the histerical what? conversation. This scene comes very early in the movie, so you would expect that the rest should equal or top that perfect scene. And while the movie is always interesting and has some other moments of great humor, it never reaches the greatness of that scene. Compared to that incredible scene, the rest of the film is a disappointment. That wouldn't be a problem if the scene had been left to the end, but since it's at the beginning....Putting that aside, this movie is so original. The characters speak a lot. In many movies, the characters only speak the necessary to advance the plot, and the action is given more importance. However, in Pulp Fiction, characters are given the chance to talk, as we talk in everyday life. As a result, the characters seem incredibly real and we care a lot about them. The non-linear structure is another plus. It's a very intelligent way to grab the audience and not letting go. At times the movie gets a little boring but you never lose interest because you always want to know whether the movie will move forward or backwards. Movies that play with time always work. Well, most of the time, at least.What about the acting? My personal favorite was Samuel L. Jackson. But everybody did a good job including Quentin Tarantino as the guy who helps the guys hide the body but is afraid that his wife might arrive and discover the whole deal. Uma Thurman was also great at portraying that strange woman who apparently likes to play with people's feelings, knowing that they're afraid of her, because of her husband. John Travolta  was my least favorite. He was too inexpressive for me, although, perhaps he did that intentionally because the character required it.Overall: 9/10."
5 August 1998,ving13,8,14,10,The most influential movie of the decade,"Tarentino's masterpiece has sent shockwaves through the entire film industry.  So many films are clones of it, try to imitate the dialogue, or hype, where applicable, their stars ""of Pulp Fiction fame."" Pulp Fiction features dialogue that rings true to life, unpredictable plot turns, and plenty of humor.  To best enjoy this movie, know as little about it before viewing it.  The non-linear plot serves a purpose and is not merely a gimmick.  It puts the most fitting part at the end of the film.  Truly a historic film in many ways."
26 October 2005,RockStrongo,72,174,2,Totally underwhelmed,"This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it."
7 January 1999,Ian-67,4,6,10,What a wonderful movie!!!,"Ok, no review now because we all saw this awesome movie. The best is not the actors (despite the great Samuel L. Jackson), is I guess, the wonderful script about that kind of things that we usually in our minds we have, but that we never get out from our mouth.I mean, the silence when we talk with another, the things we know about erotism and sexuality but never talk about it, that moral and ethic we have, but never use, etc...At the end, we only may say that Tarantino do everything he could, and now, 4 years later, we may say, that this is a film for all eras, because that kind of speech is the kind we live every day, in all walks of life. Do not judge the bad words, or the places around, look for the speech... that's the real thing."
2 February 1999,bl-2,57,155,1,Disgusting,"This is one of those movies (like ""Fargo"") which expects the audience to laugh about the most cruel scenes of violence. That's not only disgusting but even dangerous, because in spite of ""It's only a movie, you know"" we all should know how influential screen behaviour might be, don't we?"
8 March 2021,PsychoBeard666,2,3,10,Flawless,"Arguably Tarantino's best movie with an unusual yet talented cast. Travolta on his way back up the movie pecking order in an iconic duo with Samuel L. Jackson, sharing scenes with amazing actors such as Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken...Anyway, it's a perfect movie."
26 December 2001,voxhumana,26,60,5,What a godawful piece of crap,"I am at a complete loss as to what anyone can see in this film. By it's very title it glorifies the days when ""story"" was a cheap and disposable commodity, and seeks to canonise it's lack of a script as a result. I'm sorry - ""anti-art"" has all been done before, and it wasn't very interesting with the dadaists back in 1915 either.Poor acting, a non-existent script, dialogue written by someone who thinks swearing still has ""shock"" value and endless, pointless violence. The burger discussion was the nearest thing to a highlight."
23 November 2006,sugar_daddyo,18,46,1,Shocking,"Fortunately I only caught pieces of this trash on cable where the language and other filth were edited. Only some sort of strange perverted voyeurism can explain why the redemption of assassins, sodomites, and other sociopaths garners such attention. Or perhaps most of the movie going public is not that far removed from the experiences of these miscreants, and any message of unburdened hope is received with resounding aplomb. The next thing we know people will be claiming pornography possesses redeeming cultural qualities and Oscar performances befitting the publick's adulations. Or has Boogie Nights already claimed that role? Whatever the case, Pulp Friction is just another post-modern nihilistic romp.I guess I can take comfort in the fact that my 1 out of 10 stars vote will depress the rating of this film even though the usefulness of my comment will get many 'No' votes. So, go ahead and vote away and confirm my suspicions. Your favorite movie still has a 1 vote in IMDb from me, and I enjoy watching them add up!Last count, 11 people found my comment unuseful!"

One has the sense of a hyped up boxing match where the Champ get cut in the 1st minute of the 1st round, thus ruled a ""no-contest"" ...I can see it appealing to some MTV-type crowd or some that desperately cr ave something original (which it is) , but gives me nothing to ""digest"" once over, VS something one can really connect (and sink his teeth into like : The Shawshank Redemption, Gattaca, American Beauty - that one is a rose, by any other name ...And it **Certainly** doesn't deserve to be in the Top100 of all times !

6 June 2005,jim-862,30,70,1,A bandwagon-hype-faux-happening,"Sorry you QT worshippers. This film first of all was no Reservoir Dogs, and second of all, doesn't have the edge or guts of ""Fight Club"" or ""American History X"", for example.This is a ""tour-de-FORCED"", ""I'm-so-full-of-my-self"", pant-load of a movie. Calculated hit for the ""I'm-so-full-of-my-self"" yuppie-money-punk crowd, who think they are ""HIP"" and ""COOL"" because they connect with ""The Street"".Analogy:""Pulp Fiction"" is to ""Reservoir Dogs"" as ""Oceans 11"" is to The GetawayThis film is a Tarantino Ego Trip that merits no higher, in my humble though strong opinion, no higher than a ""5""."
23 November 2006,wereuat06-1,4,7,9,All Hail Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest crime stories ever told on screen and portrayed by great actor including Travolta and Jackson. This movie had high expectations after Reservoir Dogs. It did not only live up to those expectations but went above and beyond. It is told by one of the greatest directors of our history with a stylish and violent twist that everyone likes in a while. This movie has everything a perfect movie should have, guns, death, betrayal, and love. This movie keep me pumped the whole way down the road. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a violent and a great story with excellent attitude. It could not have done any better then it was I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
4 May 2005,eternal_winner,40,89,2,Not a very good movie,"I never really like when a movie gets labeled a ""defining chapter"" of movie making or gets named a classic just cause it's different. Sometimes it is sometimes it's not. Clockwork orange is one of those which i felt was garbage as a movie. Pulp fiction is another. Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems. If u want a true story, a movie with substance and an experience richer after wards, this is not a movie to get anywhere near."
4 February 2021,xaapaas,3,4,10,Dialogue at its best,"This is arguably one of the most influential films of all time. Story-telling with totally entertaining dialogue with teasing subtext. If you're a film student, this is a must-watch. Some movies, as great as they are, once you're done watching, you know, you would never want to watch them again. Pulp fiction gets better with each screening as you discover more layers in the story."
23 July 2019,FeastMode,4,9,5,my notes,"Decent movie with an interesting story but very long and sometimes boring. It had trouble keeping my interest at times. And I also found the nonlinear storytelling very unnecessary and it didn't add anything to the movie. Completely dialogue-based, which is not normally my thing even though a lot of the dialogue was very good. Some very memorable moments. all star cast with some great performances (2 viewings)"
4 July 2020,ronakkotian,2,3,10,A timeless classic,"It's crazy to think how I've never seen Pulp Fiction until a few days ago. It's crazy how it's one of the last Tarantino movies I've seen and the fact that it still holds up is mindblowing.Pulp Fiction is a collection of four stories that interwine which include a boxer, two hitmen, a gangster and his wife and two bandits.The amazing part of Pulp Fiction is how brilliant each scene and each character is. Each scene has iconic written all over it. I thought the film was going to be overly violent but that's not the case. It's just characters talking but it's the dialogues that make it so engaging. Seeing John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages for a couple of minutes make them feel like ordinary people rather than just hitmen. There is a feeling of realism between each character interaction. It's something moves steadily without losing momentum at any given point. Then you have characters that only appear for a short amount of time like Mr. Wolf and they have such a huge and memorable impact on the film. If this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best screenplay, I don't know what is.Another aspect that caught my attention was the excellent soundtrack. It's no surprise for a Tarantino film to have great song choices and placements but there's something about the songs in Pulp Fiction that work so well with each scene they're embedded into. It's absolutely perfect. The film's narrative is very interesting as it goes back and forth with each chapter. Each chapter, by the way, is fantastic. All of them are filled with terrific moments and iconic scenes that makes it difficult to lose interest. If that wasn't enough, the performances will surely win you over. It's great to see John Travolta and Bruce Willis give stellar performances especially after seeing them in the films they're currently doing. Samuel L. Jackson has never been better and the rest of the extraordinary ensemble cast are at the top of their game.I love seeing filmmakers express their love for cinema within each of their films and Tarantino has been consistently doing that, creating memorable movies his entire career. Pulp Fiction will remain his masterpiece for years to come. Now that I think of it, it's no surprise how well Pulp Fiction holds up to this day. After all, it is a timeless classic."

9 March 2008,kingmonkey,10,22,3,"all fuss, no substance","in the wake of his awesome debut, Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino could have served up just about anything and it would have been hailed as a masterpiece by all those keen to jump on the bandwagon. he, sadly, did just serve up anything.on your first viewing, Pulp Fiction does take your breath and look stunning. if you want to join the masses and celebrate this film blindly, you may then want to avoid the rest of this review and never watch the film more than once.if you be generous enough to let the flimsy, contrived plot threads go by you, the real problem here is what the film was oddly celebrated for - the bad writing and the lousy dialog that shall forever haunt this film. sure, there are one or two smart one-liners, but the problem is that each and every character in this film talks, acts and behaves the same. the lengthy speech given by Christopher Walken, for instance, is the same in tone and content as anything that Samuel L Jackson would say, and likewise Sam just talks like Uma Thurman, who talk like Bruce Willis, who talks like John Travolta, etc, etc ad nauseum.this, and the subsequent, poorer films he made, revealed Tarantino to be a confidence trickster, a, if you will, one trick pony. what a shame, he looked like he had so much talent and potential.be brave, do not just follow the crowd and the masses - see this badly written home movie for the low grade, half-dimensional nonsense that it is!!"

                        ",A masterpiece! Did you really expect me to say anything else?,"Today I just heard about the death of Dee Dee Ramone, and after getting over the initial shock, it made me think about 'Pulp Fiction'. This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking music of the Ramones, has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. The many talentless punk bands who have recycled watered down and witless imitations of Da Brudders music haven't made 'Rocket To Russia' any less brilliant, only more so. The same thing goes with Quentin Tarantino's countless less talented followers. They just make you appreciate 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' even more.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script (though influenced by Kubrick's 'The Killing', and the experiments of the French New Wave) has been much imitated and will continue to do so, the fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie buffs, especially 70s nuts like myself. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - ""believe the hype!"""
16 June 2000,rjrozen,53,126,6,Not the classic that the critics say,"I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of ""multiple narratives"" in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?"
12 July 2010,Eternality,4,8,10,Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.,"What else is there to say about Pulp Fiction that has not been said? I am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to Quentin Tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. So, if you will, let me ramble.After the breakthrough at Sundance that was Reservoir Dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as Tarantino at that time. Here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. Such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in.What happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. His ""stories"" became Reservoir Dogs, and two years later, he made the Palme d'Or winning Pulp Fiction at age 31. To my knowledge, the only American filmmaker I could think of who won the coveted Cannes award at a younger age was Steven Soderbergh for Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) at 26.The fear of making an explosive debut like Reservoir Dogs is that it is tricky to score again. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. Easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, Pulp Fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing.The four stories are as follows: One, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two mob hit men who work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. Two, Vincent is tasked by Marcellus to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. Three, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer, betrays Marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. Four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons.One way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. Expertly crafted by Tarantino (who won an Oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer Roger Avary), Pulp Fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Amores Perros, 2000; 21 Grams, 2003). While it takes some time to understand what Tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling.The performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. The signature Tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.Pulp Fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre – the gangster crime-thriller – to suit contemporary tastes. As much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban America, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by Jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
30 August 2020,grantsmyhre,3,3,10,One of cinema's milestones,"A movie with no real solid plot, Pulp Fiction launches you smack dab in the middle of the happenings and the inter-connectedness of a group of characters. Structured unusually and executed freely, the movie is deliciously cliched and groundbreaking all at once. It offers a careless normalcy to violence and crime and expresses this through the sickly humor. Tarantino becomes the master of creating so much with so little, which is especially evident in the pointless yet captivating dialogue, and with the drawn out but mesmerizing shot composition. It's over the top but hell that's the fun of it all."
25 May 2017,connorveenstra,4,6,7,An enjoyable noir story,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."
9 July 2020,ArjunnBoruah,6,8,10,Outstanding.,It's a masterpiece. I feel bad about those people who are yet to taste this masterpiece.
18 February 2021,byappucherianvlogs,2,2,10,A tarentino film,I really liked this film because of tarentino style especially violence. And actors are the best especially samuel l jackson. You want to watch this movie if you didn't saw any tarentino. This movie is still fresh even after 26 years
24 January 2012,daddyofduke,4,6,8,What Is Crazy Anyway?,"There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.I admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.John Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter. Directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.The dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.Everyone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.And remember, ""Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character."""
8 October 1999,Danimal-7,6,13,5,The appeal of this movie escapes me,"This oddly intertwined series of tales is chiefly about two professional assassins, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the boss's wife out to eat.  (Trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). Haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and of Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for Wallace and thus earns his enmity.Some things are not wrong with PULP FICTION.  I do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to glorify violence and drug abuse.  It does play both these things for comic effect, in what I found a very tasteless, vulgar, and unfunny style, but I don't think Tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are actually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically.  And the acting by Jackson, Rhames, and, yes, Willis is pretty darn good.Nevertheless, PULP FICTION bored me out of my mind.  I was not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in any way remotely approaching my own.  And much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the plot. To be fair, Tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases.  The lines never sound artificial, forced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real people's conversations.  But I don't listen to strangers' banal conversations, because they're boring if I don't know the people.  And that's exactly how boring the conversations in PULP FICTION are.PULP FICTION's genius is generally said to lie in its accomplishments as a black comedy.  Well, whatever floats your boat.  I got very few laughs out of this picture.  Interestingly, I always find my friends' re-enactments of their favorite scenes from PULP FICTION to be much funnier than seeing the scenes themselves.  I was amused twice in the final tale by Tarantino's spoofing of movie cliches, as where Jules urged Honeybunny to ""stay calm, point the gun at me,"" and where a hapless gunman misses Jules and Vincent with an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties' amazement.  But aside from that, the comedy eluded me.  I don't know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like Christopher Walken's scene as being some kind of comic genius.  Furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy don't mix well for my taste.Tarantino does have some imagination handling the camera.  For instance, Vincent at one point is told that Marsellus Wallace had a man thrown off a building for massaging Mrs. Wallace's feet; later, when Vincent meets Mrs. Wallace on orders to take her to a restaurant, the camera never leaves Mrs. Wallace's feet.But Tarantino's imagination often is no more than showing off.  The film's structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word ""nonlinear"" is synonymous with ""brilliant"" and ""artistic.""  Not to be a spoilsport, but there's a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a linear fashion: that happens to be the way time flows.  I'm not saying you can't tell a good nonlinear story, but there'd better be a reason for it. And I cannot tell what Tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five (counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order.  I was not confused, but many others were, and I don't see what Tarantino gained in exchange for losing them.  One reviewer has suggested this device enabled Tarantino to put Jules' ""redemption"" at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note.  If this is so, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on Hollywood feel-good ending.Not that the ending is really bad; in fact I gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as I finally became interested in one of the characters.  I would have liked to find out whether Jules succeeded in leaving the criminal life.  Of course, I take self-confessed ""redemptions"" with a grain of salt, but since Jules seems to be uncertain himself about whether he'll kick the criminal habit, I can live with that.  But redeemed or not, Jackson couldn't completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours.Rating: ** out of ****."
17 May 2006,PaulNewmanIsDead,31,70,1,Worst Film Ever. Pulp Fact,"I rent the film because the fact that it's #9 on IMDb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film. So I watched it last night, I couldn't believe my eye, what a piece of garbage film-making this is, the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million F word in it. the character sucked, I never felt I care about them. And the worst thing is that there's not motherfreaking plot! I watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on. I cannot think of any positive things about this film.And why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics? Here's some of my theory: 1. this is a very unique film for its time, so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film, so whoever hate this film would considered ""uncool"" 2. Pulp Fiction is so bad that it's good. As mention before, pulp fiction is a unique film, it's so unique that it's hard to tell that it's good or bad, but the critics decided to call it good, soon a bandwagon start.the bottom line is, do not watch this film, don't care about what other people say. If this comment doesn't convince you to stay away from this film, then go to page 5,6,7,8, there are other people who just hate this film as much as I do"
21 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,5,13,10,There's nothing fictional about this movie's high quality.,"""Pulp Fiction"" has partly gone down in history as the movie that revived John Travolta's career, but it's more than that. A look into the lives of several criminals, it's likely to shake up almost anyone. The first time that I ever saw the movie, my dad (who'd already seen it) sent me out of the room for the scene where Bruce Willis...well, I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).All in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy."
21 January 2021,tiagocshaw,6,8,10,It's AMAZING,I mean it's pulp fiction how can you not like this movie.
21 April 2006,Galina_movie_fan,4,9,10,"He will strike down upon us with great style, class, irony, wit, and talent.","I just love ""Pulp Fiction"". I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV. Every time I see it, it seems to get better and better. I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end I don't care a bit about the mysterious case. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art. It is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. It is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap ""pulp fiction"" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary took the clichés of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. I should mention Tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for ""Pulp Fiction"" (as for all of his films) is just killer. And last but not least - how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. There are no bad performances in ""Pulp Fiction"". For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.I've read many times on these boards that ""Tarantino is a rip-off artist"", that ""he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies."" I often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. He is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. I cannot resist. Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""Pulp Fiction""."
3 November 2002,Tommydevito,7,13,10,A true original,"While I don't think its better than Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction certainly comes close. PF is definitley one of the 5 best movies of the 1990s and established Tarantino as an accomplished filmmaker. Everyone knows the screenplay, acting, and direction are top notch, so I won't get into that. Bottom Line: Classic film that everyone should see. 10/10"
7 November 2000,Mickey Knox,4,8,10,probably the best movie ever,"It all began with RESERVOIR DOGS. An unbelievebly real movie that got a new name in the minds of all movie lovers acrossed the world: QUENTIN TARANTINO. PULP FICTION continues what Reservoir Dogs started, and proves that Quentin is indeed one of the best and most original directors ever. Who else could write three attractive totally different stories, and get them together into a thrilling 3 hour movie that will not even allow you to breathe? And probably the best part about the movie is the dialogue: fast, ingenious, exciting. Perfect. Two guys, John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson, almost screw up a job they have to take care of. A boxer, Bruce Willis, just before a fight in which he's asked to lose. Two thieves, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deciding to rob a restaurant. Take these three stories, put them together in a bowl, and shake as much as you can. Result: a brilliant film. A big-size puzzle that will make you think. I know that it's one of the most known movies in the world. But if by any chance you have done the stupid thing of not seing it, then hurry up. Cause Quentin's not wasting time: new masterpieces are coming up soon.Vote: 10 (out of 10"

                        ",Definetly One Of the Best Films Of All Time!!!,"This movie is full of obscanities, violence, it is gritty, gutter, shocking, real...and definetly the best.  What makes this movie, and not Slumber Party Massacre the best, is that this movie provides insight on the life of hitmen.  Generally speaking, a day in the life of a hitman, not really there life.  From what I seen, it was a day in the life of Jules and Vincent. That's why this movie is so excellent.  It is just nothing anybody has ever seen, and the title warns you before you enter the theater, and also provides a definition of ""pulp"" before the movie starts.  The performances are amazing, providing an all star cast, throughout.  It's kinda hard who takes the cake.. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta both provide amazing performances....Rossana Arqueete is great as a peircing junkie, Uma Thurman, well, watch it and youll see... and so on and so on.What is there not to like about this movie?  If your looking for a ""gone With the Wind"" you will not find it, this is a gritty, gutter movie, not afarid to let anything go, which is why Quentin Tarantino is my idol."

25 September 2000,Matchboy,90,212,1,Unadulterated dreck,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
22 November 2004,jay4stein79-1,5,11,7,Oscillating Wildly,"Have you ever gone from one extreme to the other on an issue? Our President excluded, many of us change our minds about things on a daily basis. When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again."
11 July 2002,rodnie,6,10,10,Pure Class,"This is independent film-making at its finest, with the best ensemble cast to have possibly ever graced the silver screen.  Tarantino will never equal this.

2 February 2021,paudieconnolly,2,3,10,A perfect Ten from the beginning and back there again,The most amazing film from seeing it the first time in the mid 90s today has lost none of its magic from the opening scene with shades of reservoir dogs start in the restaurants. The simple setting with immediate addictive dialogue hooks you from the beginning. It is long before the film takes off to a new never before level of movie making the visual brilliance of the scenes and stories The intertwining of the different tales into each other the choice of order and the eventuality of being let back to the beginning makes this for me one of the all-time greatest films and from the very first viewing knowing this is going to be one of the worlds greatest directors. so many amazing performances career defining roles for stars at the top of there games actors aided by an amazing script. which still to this day is timeless like Reservoir dogs before it how to tell when it was supposed to be set what year? which just helps to make the film still perfect 30 years later. Stories could've just as easily be made into three four five maybe even six movies instead what you have is it beautifully mix intertwining timeless tales told by a master who's love of cinema is all over this movie.
15 January 2016,mistoppi,1,1,10,"There's no denying it, one of the best movies ever made","My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill. I saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.I love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.Pulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.The characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.Pulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made."

                        ",A Masterpiece,"In my humble opinion, I believe that this is Tarentino's finest movie. As I grew older and older I've come to realize that this masterpiece from the 90s aged like fine wine. It's easily one of the most rewatchable movies considering it's filled with an insane amount of quotables, great cinematography and most importantly, charming characters that will stand the test of time.I truly believe that this movie is a work of art, the way Tarentino handpicked the songlist for the soundtrack helped elevate every single scene of the movie to a whole new level.To cut this short, this movie is easily one of the best movies ever made, and my personal favorite movie and I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a shot."

There are 3 stories, each revolving around L.A crime. The first one is about an overdose, the second (and weirdest) is about a boxer and the third (in my opinion the best) about 'divine intervention'.

When I went to a Film Production class I eventually dropped out of, the professor and a classmate where like how can you want to be a film critic and have not seen Pulp Fiction and would always ask me you seen Pulp Fiction yet everyday. Pulp Fiction is set in the early ninety's and tells three stories of characters played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis to name a few. As the film started I didn't get it but as we went through the first two stories I started to get the gist of it. If it weren't the first few weeks I was in that class I wouldn't have noticed the shots in the second story where John Travolta and Uma Thurman sitting down in the diner how the shots are equivalent to each other and don't change too often. The films a product of the nineties with its music but my favorite scenes is those silent moments like in the diner or in the last story where a man in the bathroom comes out starts shooting at Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) and it stops they look and you know whats bout to happen. I love how all the stories leave on a note like whatever happen to these two or whats going to go on next, it doesn't just give you an answer. Pulp Fiction is one of the great giant achievements in filmaking and in film history and I can see why. The stories are fun to sit through and all the shots from director and star Quentin Tarantino are amazing and the cast is very memorable."
22 March 2021,Filmdokter,1,1,8,A landmark film that changed world cinema,"Let's be honest: if I had to rate Pulp Fiction based on it's monumental influence on world cinema I would rate a 10. Tarantino took what he knew and loved from the history of cinema (from exploitation cinema to the work of Godard) and reinvented it. Pulp Fiction is still his most important film. But it's not always an easy watch for an average filmgoer: there is no clear narrative and some scenes drag on a bit too long.

I can assure that even Godard will say that this film has no beginning,no middle and no end and that too in no particular sense.As Quentino Tarantino has crooked teeth may be people like his films for that reason.All the actors of this film look confused.The great actress from Portugal Maria de Medeiros wasted her talent for a minor role which no one will ever bother to remember.Although it was a comeback vehicle for John Travolta,he has not acted well.Sam Jackson is confused.The most confused of them all is Christopher Walken.Let the others make merry but Quentin Tarantino will bore people to death with silly films like Kill Bill.Stay way from this film as it is a waste of money."

Q.TS second movie is his best nothing since has matched the sheer brilliance of this film every character is memorable even if they are on screen for less than five minutes. Nothing in pop culture comes close to replecacting the quintessential brilliance of the tight script wonderfully acted film that just flows so well. Q.Ts most powerful directoring achievement is his second film. Not only does it launch stars but it gives life to failing stars revetlising failing acters and giving them a shot of life who would go on to command bigger salaries in bigger budget movies.
Unlike Quentin's latter movies that have much more bigger budgets and bloated runtimes the modest budget used on pulp fiction helps the director to sculpt a script and runtime to perfection within the limited budget. It's a masterpiece and lots of films have tried and failed to replicate the Quetin standard formula of his first two movies but failed terribly."
18 June 2008,gavin6942,4,10,9,Considered Tarantino's Masterpiece... Set a New Standard,"Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Death Proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, ""Bruce Willis."" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (""Die Hard"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""Pulp Fiction"" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen ""Pulp Fiction"", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in ""Death Proof""), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why."
25 July 2021,Sunsphxsuns,1,1,10,WHY YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM,"You must see this film simply because there's no other movie like it. It's Quentin Tarantino, red hot and constantly in motion, like the flames from the torches carried by the angry villagers in Frankenstein (1931). If you are new to Tarantino, and want to explore the style of this director/writer, Pulp Fiction is your starting gate.Tarantino was clearly running on 12 cylinders with Pulp Fiction, from start to finish, and by the end of the film, you'll suddenly feel as if your heart had stopped beating and you had inexplicably forgotten how to breathe. And for all of its visual intensity and pathos, the film explodes with some of the most witty and cutting dialogue since John Houston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). You could spend all afternoon discussing Pulp Fiction's myriad of memorable quotes.There are so many classic scenes in Pulp Fiction it would be a sacrilege to mention them here (although the ""hamburger scene"" stands out from everything else).This is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest hours, and the film, bold and shocking, remains peerless."
21 April 2018,saru2020,3,6,5,I don't understand what it has that its been called as Cult,"Watching it 28years after its release, i don't get the point of whats there in the movie & why its called as one of the cult classics? Maybe it broke the typical single genre kind or it was seen as a crazy uninterlinked parallel set of 3 stories mixed or may be the crazy dialog that gave it so much fame? I don't know seriously. But many old guys call it as the best, just for that sake, I'll give it an average rating."
8 January 2000,Stu-42,9,22,3,The first negative comment,"No, this film did not repulse me as much as reservoir dogs did. That's among the best things I can say about this movie. The fact that so many people seem to love it so much is actually frightening to me. I just can't seem to understand the desire to see this director's shock value material. What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess. All in all, excrutiating, but as I say a step up from the first film by Tarantino."

It made me want to pursue a career as a screenwriter.There's nothing about this movie that I can say that hasn't been set already. I'll just say that the movie never gets old, it just gets better. It can't be ruined for me. Every film Tarantino has made is great but he will never recreate the magic of this movie!

8 May 2007,Galagonya,16,45,1,Couldn't make it through.,"I have not been able to get over more than 15 minutes of this movie despite several attempts due to the fact that everybody is always so keen on Pulp Fiction.I suppose the trick must lie somewhere after these 15 minutes, but it is rare to see such uninteresting characters (two otherwise so great actors, really) chat for such an incredibly long time without any sense in their dialog at all. I simply can't get beyond that initial quarter of an hour even with fast-forwarding. Why is everyone so frantic about this film? I felt I simply had to comment on this movie so as to somewhat spoil the (in my opinion undeservedly) excellent rating."

11 January 2002,m_madhu,1,1,10,this film rocks!!!!!!!,"pulp fiction is as good as film noir gets. tarantino brilliantly weaves his different plots into one madcap movie that just races along. the humour is out of this world, tongue in cheek and nasty. but hey, it works. boy! does it work!!! the actors are all fantastic, personally my favorite characters were honey bunny and pumpkin. they were incredibly funny. not to take anything away from any other character though. each one is a gem. the best thing about this movie is that it stands up to repeated watching. everytime i see the movie its as fresh as the first time and infact i enjoy it more and more. tarantino takes the film noir genre and turns it around with so many amazing twists. its a long movie, but never feels that way. and it is slick!! fast and slick!! i've seen this movie often enough and there is not one scene that i think is out of place or should have been cut out. each scene is full of  wonder and demands your attention. this for me is a great pep up movie. it fills me with energy. i am not very queasy about al the violence and bloodshed. if you are, you might not enjoy it. else, go ahead have a ball and feast on this cracker of a movie. a rip roaring 10!!"

27 September 2019,brambilar,8,11,10,Cinematic Masterpiece,"This movie without a doubt has never had a dull moment, there is always something bizarre or interesting happening around every corner. The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece."

22 June 2007,leonardwatson212,22,49,1,One of the worst movies ever made...,"If I could give this film a negative 10 it would not begin to describe how horrible it is. There is little to no plot, the story never resolves, and it jumps around in time and sequence so much that it is impossible to make any sense out of it. I fail to see why so many people actually like this film, and why it continues to get great reviews. The only thing this film offers is a lot of graphic violence and blood throughout the entire movie (the only thing that Quentin Tarantino is good for). When you finally do reach the end you find yourself wondering why in the world you just wasted so much time. Time that could have been better spent cleaning your sock drawer."

18 May 2008,adamgreasley,141,255,6,A masterpiece? Do me a favour!,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
28 June 2016,bt698nhj,1,1,8,Revolting Travoltaing But Still Good,"Really like the style and feel of this flick. The opening in the Diner really drew me in. Actually, it raised my expectations to a level that the movie did not meet, though I still rate it an 8, which is very high on my scale.Tha alternating time sequences took a little getting used to, and the film dragged in parts. I felt the entire scene with the Wolf could have been cut or significantly edited with very little loss of entertainment value. The film was a bit self-indulgent in that regard. 2:34 alone tells you that. Nevertheless, it was highly entertaining, even if looking at Travolta's hair was revolting.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding.

28 July 2012,mtthwibrahim,56,128,1,Flat and Brainless,"As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema"
5 May 2019,Sunny_Kumar,7,12,10,Masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. . Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis.

Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages. But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.That's why the name :""Pulp Fiction"""

I did not like it because it is violent for violence's sake and unless you think that is funny, it is not interesting. Another movie from Quentin Tarantino that is just crude. Pulp says it all. The writing is clever. I won't deny that. The cast is good. What a waste of talent. To put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times. It is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type. It seams in order to make a ""GREAT"" movie all you have to do is put as much violence, sex and the F word as you can and people will laud you. There is no redeeming value in this movie."

Now, I don't't think that it's the best movie ever and I don't think that everybody has to like it, because it can easily be disliked. What I don't understand is this- Why does this film have such a bad reputation. Just think this over, please, all of you people who wail and complain about how horribly violent it is.How on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?"
13 July 2021,chervenkov,3,5,7,"Watched it because of the rating, however didn't quite hit the mark for me","Quick disclaimer, I am 24 and have generally not seen tons of 90's movies. I read somewhere that this film is a landmark of modern cinema and has influenced many other gangster flicks after it. That certainly makes sense, has a unusual plot line(if you can call it that) for it's time, has grotesque violence and obviously not taking itself too seriously.Moreover, no subject matter, to me it felt the scenes were purposely constructed to give off artsy notion and not develop the story. It seemed like ''art made for the sake of making art'' which is pretentious in my eyes, however many people obviously find it riveting.There is this sequence of scenes which is so completely out of left field that will most likely make you feel emotionally disturbed (don't want to spoil it). Again, it is completely random, however made me chuckle. You can't help but admire Tarantino's audacity to put the most shocking things in front of the eyes of millions. Did not like him as an actor though, the incoherent digressions were a bit too much at a certain point.If you are expecting something meaningful, skip this one. It definetely leaves you with sense of emptiness when over. The thought ""What on earth did I just watch'' was swirling in my head for some time after. Don't think I would consider rewatching it."
9 April 2005,Science_Fantasy_Guy,4,7,10,Tarantino's masterpiece,"What can one say about Pulp Fiction, that hasn't already been said about it? One of the best action films ever? No doubt about that. A masterpiece? Said thousands of times. Quentin Tarantino best film? Said even more. One of the best of the '90s? Been said even more again. It's one of those all-around great movies. Everything from the directing, writing, acting, editing, soundtrack, humour, even the set pieces  the adrenaline shot, the ""Bad Motherf*****"" wallet, and of course the much-documented suitcase (the contents of which we never find out)  is flawless.Then there's the classic characters. The two bickering hit men Vincent Vega (a career-resurrecting performance by John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (a hilariously unforgettable Samuel L. Jackson), their boss's sexy wife Mia (Uma Thurman), the desperate prize-fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and the two clumsiest bank robbers ever put on film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), all of them enjoyable. Travolta, Jackson and Thurman were all nominated for Oscars for their performances.This was the movie that changed the face of indie films forever. But ultimately it's Tarantino's movie. He is responsible for putting all the elements of it together to form one massive and enormously enjoyable ensemble piece. His direction is outstanding and his screenplay  one of the best ever written  is even better. With great character development, wild action scenes, brilliantly inspired dialogue and memorable conversations between the characters involving everything from robbing restaurants to foot massages to the names of European hamburgers, it's no wonder why it won the film's only Oscar.Throw in some clever editing, a typically Tarantino '60s and '70s soundtrack, and fine cinematography  the single shot of Jules and Vincent walking through the foyer of an apartment building is a highlight  and you've got yourself a masterpiece, one of the best movies of all time.Let's face it, Pulp Fiction is most certainly not one to show to the kiddies (the F-word is used an unbelievable 271 times throughout its 2 1/2 hours, and that's just for starters) or to watch with Grandma (the rapist scene is not for the faint-hearted), but that only makes it even more of a guilty pleasure.It remains the crowning achievement of one of the most daring and individual film-making talents to come out of the '90s.10/10."

HEY,PEOPLE THEY ARE KILLERS! Movie fans treat them like fans of Mickey and Mallory in Natural Born Killers. WOW, THEY ARE COOL AND FUNNY! BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES BRAVO! (DUDES). In this picture show, the good guys are ruthless, mean, brutal, murdering outlaws and they do it with a twinkle in their eye. Not realistic. I am amazed at the number of people who love this movie. It must be the phenomena of when you tell drunk jokes to a drunk; they love it.I am not one of those pristine few who believe that movies should have no violence. Many of favorite movies are violent.The part where Travolta blows a guy's head off is not funny to me nor is the one with Jackson and Travolta killing people in the beginning. The drug overdose with Uma and the needle slamming into her chest is not funny or entertaining and yep, I always laugh and watch rape and sodomy for entertainment. Jackson and Willis are the highlights in the movie to me. They give a little moxy to the flick but they can't save it. I did love seeing John Travolta returning to the dance floor (very clever), but it was not enough to keep this movie ""stayin alive"". The movie ranked up their with professional wrestling. I almost had to kick my own ass for watching all of it. I pulled the plug on this one before it made a vegetable out of me.The plot is anemic. The violence is the steak and the plot is not even a baked potato side order. The plot clings to this Hollywood entree like wilted parsley. In the end ,just like food, it all does come together and should be flushed down just like last nights supper.If I had to watch it again I think I would get a blow torch and some pliers and get medieval on some pulp video."

Jackson.His speeches & the dialog delivery timing perfectly fits.Bruce Willis is again good.Somebody wrote like John Travolta looked lost.Absolutely right.Uma Thurman is kind of OK.Rest of the casting is also OK only.But what was the point for this movie.In the end,we come to know that everyone in this film are on a violent streak and only one wants to change.But this is no concrete story & its a strange way to tell a story.I don't get it how its in the top 10 of IMDb.Reservoir Dogs was more interesting & fun compared to this.So people only see this one if you have a knack for saying some pretty cool mother f***** dialogs otherwise you will end up being disappointed.I give it a 5 just for the character setup Quentin tries to achieve.Apart from that,sorry Tarantino,i hope you learn from this."
27 March 2020,g-96059,1,1,8,Great.,"From the point of view of the structure of the play, quentin abandoned the traditional Hollywood way, and with the technique of separating the points of view, the whole film narrative treatment into a kind of echo ""circular structure"". In this novel overall structure, every story in ""pulp fiction"" is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental.
In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith. The film was cut to pieces by the director to cover up the truth that people should have faith."

9 July 2020,navnishb,2,2,9,Overall i felt the movie was a masterpiece,"Pulp - 1. A soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter .
2. A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.Quentin Tarantino is a brilliant director and does an amazing job on his 2nd feature length film which is a terrific film. Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Jules is truly a role for the ages. John Travolta as Vince was also quite good but what I felt was that Bruce Willis as Butch and Ving Rhames as Marsellus really stole the show. The side story with Butch and Marsellus was filled to the brim with suspense. It leaves people anticipating what would happen next. Some people find the violence in the movie too much but personally I feel it has the perfect balance between gore and drama.Many Quentin Tarantino films tend to follow a non-linear pattern and Pulp Fiction perfects this formula to the max. The cameo made by Quentin as Jimmie is quite humorous in certain ways and feels like a proper fleshed-out character. Uma Thurman does a wonderful job portraying Mia . An underrated aspect of the film is how each character is related one way or the other. Jules and Vince were hired by Marsellus, Mia is married to Marsellus and Butch worked with him before. Overall i felt the movie was a masterpiece."

                        ",Crazyness all over the board,"for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film."
13 April 2020,z-07842,5,8,8,not too bad,"It resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genresI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong."
25 April 2020,yuzou-45815,1,1,9,nice,"The masterpiece of the non-linear narrative film. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, with wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly going to darkness and confusion. Each paragraph has no beginning and end, a complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar movies in reality always happen and never stop.
Line: Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find a truly special person can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
26 October 2020,bignuts-06245,1,1,7,Another Tarantino classic...,"Starring Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis & many more!The lives & stories of 2 gangsters along with their boss & his wife plus a boxer & 2 petty criminals all become intertwined into a complex rollercoaster of a classic!It's not one of my favourites but it's a must watch even if it is just the once like myself, you won't be disappointed!"
13 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,5,15,5,"Oh Quentin, Quentin...","This is probably the hardest movie for me to rate and review; how do you review a film where about half of it is great, and the rest(which pretty much means the other half) is awful? I decided to rate it a 5, since that seems to be the sensible thing to do in this situation. Like a few others have said, Tarantino's style is hip and makes you, the audience, feel hip. The dialog, the editing, the violence... the problem is, it's empty. The dialog is entirely superficial, which is OK if there's not too much of it or what there is there to be superficial. But here it carries half of the scenes. The dialog scenes(as pretty much everything else in the film) is very dull, visually. The camera doesn't move and rarely changes angle, and it's something that'll make you fall asleep, if the pointless, shallow dialogs don't do so first. The editing is daft as well. The violence is so over the top that you almost have to be mentally disturbed not to be affected(read: repulsed) by it... is that why it's there? Does Tarantino want to gross out his audience? Is that what it's about? The length and pace is horrible. I don't believe I've ever managed to sit through the entire thing attentively. The problem is not the length itself as much as what appears to be Tarantino yelling at his audience ""You want to see my movie? Well, you better prepare to sit there for what feels like 10 hours straight!"" Just to ensure that there are no misunderstandings; that was a metaphor. Tarantino doesn't *actually* yell at the audience. It just feels like it. The whole film feels like it's trying to get somewhere, to say something, but then the film is over, and it forgot to tell us what it was. The film is anticlimactic throughout(quite an achievement... usually only the end of a film is anticlimactic), and when it's done, you'll be saying to yourself ""That's it? What the heck was all that hype about?"" The truth is, in my opinion, a small group of Tarantino fans got together, and started 'converting' anyone they could find to love the film, and suddenly, this had taken over the general opinion on the film. Everybody thinks it's great, but no one can really explain why. I have yet to meet someone who've explained why Tarantino's films supposedly are great. Now don't get me wrong; I don't have anything against the guy. I like several of his films; Jackie Brown, From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Kill Bill 1&2. The problem here is that the film lacks any real substance. None of the characters are likable, not even slightly. They are killers, drug-dealers, psychos and morons. The film has the typical non-linear time-line which Tarantino utilizes in virtually all of his films. However, here it seems redundant, like it was just tagged on for no actual reason. Both volumes of Kill Bill were great because of good use of this; Pulp Fiction is not, because of the use of aforementioned effect is seemingly pointless here. The actors all play exactly the same type of character that they always play, with one or two possible exceptions. Samuel Jackson plays the 'violent, loud-mouthed individual with an unusual belief or philosophy' what do you know, that came right off his trademark section of his biography on this very site. John Travolta is the usual cool guy. Ving Rhames is the typical tough black guy, same as always. Do I need to go on? If you've read everything up to this point, you might think I hate this movie... I don't. I just dislike half of it. And that's just the thing... I can't entirely hate this. The scenes with Travolta and Jackson are pretty good, a few of the lines in the film are quotable, and most of the characters are well-cast. There you have it; half bad, half good. Better than Reservoir Dogs, but not as good as Jackie Brown and not even in the same league as the two Kill Bill films. I recommend this only to Tarantino junkies. Everyone should stay away, unless they are crazy about one or more actors in the film. If you do see it, only see it once and try to pay attention(even though it's really hard). 5/10"

                        ",The most over rated film of all time. 225 people here have commonsense.,"Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular? Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie? Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable."
27 March 2014,eklavya-cwk,7,18,5,What a great but useless attempt........,Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one can't deny its grandeur.But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events.

                        ",Best Film of the Nineties,"PULP FICTION(1994) **** John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Peter Greene,Frank Whaley, Julia Sweeney, Quentin Tarantino.  Propolsive in-your-face salute to film noir with a Nineties slant with savvy filmmaking from auteur Tarantino interweaving three tales of crime, sex, greed and O. Henry sensibility mixed with Murphy's Law.  Outstanding in every sense with memorable performances by all particularly dim-witted hit man Travolta (Best Actor nominee in his second comeback) and Bible-verse speaking partner Jackson (Best Supporting Actor nominee) and a beefed up and nervy turn by Willis.  Wickedly clever and outrageously funny with some truly surprising moments of unease, carefully handled violence and arguably cinema's  worst blind date ever with kudos to an adrenaline enhanced kitschy Thurman (Best Supporting Actress nominee).  Winner of The Palmme d'Orr at Cannes and Oscar winner for Tarantino (also nominated for directing and Best Picture) for Best Original Screenplay with Roger Avary.  One of the decade's best."
19 November 2021,trevorstunt,6,10,1,Garbage sewage,"The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of ""Pulp Fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.""Pulp Fiction"" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting."
17 March 2014,benjaminspetrofsky,4,6,10,I Am Completely Baffled By Some of The Reviews. Just Shows a Lack of Understanding of the Film More Than Anything,"Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.Flat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is. And too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty. I heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.Overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""Psycho,"" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.This is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""Jaws."" I'm sure not many people will call ""Jaws"" a bad film either. Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat."
6 March 2019,sterlin_rivera,1,1,10,A Wonderful Masterpiece,"I love Pulp Fiction so much. It is clearly one of the greatest films of all time.The movie centers around different storylines. The first being about two hitmen, Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), who have discussions about different things and have to do a favor for their mob boss, Marsellus Wallace. They get screwed over by some things, but manage to survive. Later on, Vincent goes on a date with Marsellus Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), and a struggling boxer name Butch (Bruce Willis) has a gold watch that was given to him, and he tries to get it back after he left it somewhere, and gets into trouble with some people.There is nothing bad about this movie at all. Sure, it maybe 2 and a half hours long, but it is worth your time. It was great acting from a great cast. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all did an outstanding job. All the other actors did a pretty solid job as well, but the first four were the true stars of the movie, and were magnificent all the way.The dialogue is the best part of this movie. Just about every other line is quotable and unforgettable. And the stories for each segment of the movie are very well put together and have a great direction from director Quentin Tarantino.All in all, you have been living under a rock if you haven´t seen Pulp Fiction. Watch it as soon as you can. It is a very very great movie."
18 December 2004,cmon3590,25,58,1,'Fiction' or something more sinister?,"I agree totally with the people here who have said, among other things, that Pulp Fiction is gratuitously violent, morally corrupt, and designed to appeal to hormonally imbalanced young males. I first saw it when it came out in 1994 and as I watched, couldn't understand why the other people in the room (my friend and her parents) were not outraged like I was. One of the more horrifying scenes that will always stand out in my mind is where a young black man is murdered and then his body dumped into the boot (trunk) of a car like a discarded shop mannequin. All this, supposedly in the name of 'art'.People say life doesn't imitate art but I disagree. How many kids saw Harry Potter and then went home and pretended to be wizards? Of course people are influenced by art, and even if they are not influenced directly, the overall sentiment or message will often leech it's way under the skin. So what kind of message are we sending out about how we treat human beings with movies like this? Why is spraying bullets into someone's head and then making jokes about how their blood will be cleaned out of the car their body has been dumped in something we want to put on film?It worries me that Tarentino knew he'd have a market for this kind of movie; Obviously, some of us want to see a movie like this ... disturbing, I believe.No amount of sophisticated direction or stylization can be used to justify this kind of travesty. Quentin Tarentino, you ought to be truly ashamed of yourself. Too unworthy to even rate."
8 August 2020,enriquelr-50976,4,5,9,Meaningless genius.,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."
19 August 2000,nehpetstephen,2,3,10,Brilliant,"Wow! Truly a modern classic! Each of the several storylines are intriguing and highly entertaining. My favorite is the one focusing on Bruce Willis as a boxer who disobeys when ordered to throw a fight for a million dollars. My least favorite is the one centering on Vincent (Travolta) and his ""date"" with Mia (Thurman), the boss's wife. In my opinion, it detracted from the crime-related tones in the other storylines, yet it was still wonderful. The acting from the all-star cast is perfect, all around. I only had one problem: Travolta. Several other reviewers state how wonderful he was in this outstanding role. Personally, I didn't think it was that remarkable. I've never really like Travolta and that may have been a factor. The real actor in this movie is Samuel L. Jackson, as a philosophical hitman--but then again, he's good in everything.So the plotlines may not be too believable, but that's the point. This film explores things that rarely happen as a natural chain of events. The Bruce Willis story--which explores how coincidences can strongly affect our lives--is one example of this. The people they run in with at the gun shop is hilarious and memorable. Quentin Tarantino has certainly outdone himself in this brilliant, classic film. Everything about it--from the very detailed, complex characters to the entertaining storylines to the stunning direction and acting--is perfect. A must see for any fan of movies. 10/10"
26 July 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,2,4,10,Perfect,"Tarantino is great director. I met Tarantino via Pulp Fiction. Music, acting, dialogues, jokes, Uma Thurman's feet .... Everything are Perfect.10 / 10."
20 August 2019,bowmanblue,2,4,10,10/10. Not much else to add,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."

I waited for it to get better; waited for the storyline to begin to take shape. However, during the first 45 minutes, i witnessed film footage that was difficult (to put it mildly) to watch. At minute 46, I gave up and decided I could no longer watch this trash and walked out. The film stinks. It was awful, it was terrible, it was disgusting."

9 January 1999,mick-30,20,46,2,F this movie.,"Pulp Fiction is one of the worst blights on American Cinema anyone could conceive of. Tarantino's enthusiasm for the awful films he loves to rehash is amusing, and his dialogue snappy and funny, but he is not a great filmmaker and his films are not great films. Him and his films get by on retro-mania, smugness, and arrogance, and will date as horribly as his source material has. Tarantino is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with indie filmmaking in the nineties, and nineties youth culture in general. Cinema, and the world, could have done without him."

15 January 2012,cinemastupid,6,10,10,The Movie,"There is a world of many, many motion pictures, from Roundhay Garden Scene in 1888, to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Ingmar Bergman, to the Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca. There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.Perhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps ""veteran"" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.Not telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.The characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.The violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.Don't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is. My hat's off to you, Quentin Tarantino, and if you haven't seen this movie already, see it. Twice."
29 April 2010,ian_bell,8,18,5,Are we supposed to be laughing?,"If Pulp Fiction were meant to be a comedy I'd be tempted to give it 7/10 for sheer effort. It's got John Travolta in a wig (check out that ponytail!) Uma Thurman pretending to be a dancer, and Mr Quentin Tarantino himself in yet another cameo trying to prove he can act, and proving beyond all doubt that he can't.Amid the farce and supposedly knowing humour of this film there is one shining light. The performance of Samuel L Jackson as a hit-man stands out as one of the performances of the 1990s. It's a shame the director got his hit men mixed up and put Travolta at the heart of this film; with Jackson front and centre this could have been a first-rate crime drama, with the added intrigue of a man atoning for some truly wicked sins.Travolta is miscast as Vincent. He plays a hit-man who talks about hamburgers on the way to murdering his victims. Not because this is what hit men do, but because Tarantino is so desperate to be seen as cool his hit men simply MUST do something different.It gets worse. Vincent is assigned to look after his boss's wife and duly ends up on the dance floor. Quite why this is supposed to be so iconic I have absolutely no idea. John Travolta moves like a bored polar bear at times, and Uma Thurman may as well be on heavy medication for all the good she is. Rarely do you have sympathy for Hollywood superstars, but watching these two I did wonder whether the pair of them might consider early retirement. If nothing else, I guess this scene offers a cautionary warning to anyone fond of a hamburger; eat too many of 'em and you too could end up like John Travolta.Throw in Bruce Willis as a disillusioned boxer, Harvey Keitel as Wolf, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as a pair of hold-up artists, and, well, you've got a film not a million miles away from a Robert Altman picture of the Seventies. Or indeed a John Cassavetes film.This is my problem with Tarantino; you watch his films and wonder if you've seen it somewhere before. Reservoir Dogs was a deserved success - critically, at least - but with Pulp Fiction we've been here before many times.Its rating on this website suggests it is up there with The Godfather, and that, frankly, is the biggest laugh of the lot. Come to think of it, maybe I was right all along; maybe it IS a comedy after all."

Whats in the briefcase? Was it really an accident shooting Marvin in the face?No one knows and quite frankly my dears - I don't give a dam.

The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it."

The plot has many dimensions that make you notice something different and new every time . The characters are developed and are realistic. There's plenty of drama in the three different stories that are occurring simultaneously. There is a good amount of action, and a little bit of comedy intertwined. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but children, unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see. You really see how amazing these actors are. I love Uma Thurman's performance, she really got into the role and perfected it."
3 November 2013,mlk960,8,15,10,Read Some Vonnegut,"Sorry to degrade from the structure of how things go, but this is a hybrid between a review and a defense of the film.As far the movie itself, I could be locked in a room for a few weeks with it. It's what movies where made for. It is entertainment- sure and simple. I'm not gonna dive really into what the movie tries to do, because I see that more as a viewer's perspective. I can say, however, that whatever it it tries to do it does well. The acting, the dialogue, and everything else about it is gripping. The most overarching thing about it to me, though, is the absurdity. The absurdity is concocted at just the right angle so as to create a strange world, but one we can dwell our minds in. Reality itself is absurd in itself, is it not? This is what particularly draws me into this movie, and makes me like it so much.This is also the reason I think a lot of people hate it. The main insults toward the film regard it's ""lack of plot,"" ""lack of core,"" and ""lack of meaning, or anything at all."" Did I miss some section of the Geneva Convention that mandated how a movie had to be made? Yeah, typically a more linear and mountain shaped plot/ story line give that feeling of satisfaction at the end, but leave that to other movies. There are plenty to spare.People accuse it of being hollow as far as spirituality and meaning go. I find this kind of funny and ironic because I think that is exactly how it emphasizes these two subjects. The interactions and experiences of the characters in this absurd reality are what make it so real. We really don't have lives much different from Vincent and Jules. We're all figuring it out as we go, , under pressure of constantly changing circumstances, making decisions for ourselves in a place where we don't have much direction.If you can't find in this movie what others do, I guess you just aren't catching with them. It's really a matter of choice. These are all things that make Kurt Vonnegut novels what they are. Lack of tangency with seemingly pointless digressions. But that is what makes them brilliant. They place a film on life to view it with a new perspective. It's up to you how much value and entertainment there is in something like that."
20 January 2012,Steffi_P,2,4,8,"""Royale with cheese""","Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying ""five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us"". One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style – he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's ""square"" is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there."
30 September 2004,tr_s,15,34,2,"No plot, no specific mission. Pointless, bad movie","I do not understand the hype. This movie was nothing but a waste of my time.Why? First, I believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know what's going on. This movie doesn't feature that. It starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending.There are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the ""right mind"" (however most are violent and immature) and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesn't pump this movie up to anything good. It kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe, that's all.To sum it up... this movie has few redeeming qualities. Do something productive and more fun instead. Such as washing the dishes.Two stars out of ten."

Breakneck pacing & some of the funniest one-liners in movie history left me gasping for breath by the time it was over. Characters in a total panic as things go more & more wrong is a staple of film & TV comedy, but when overdone it can be really irritating.

5 October 2012,metalheadstef,13,27,3,"Didn't like it at all! it's just me, I guess...","I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the film's cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn't like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction..."

A couple of days ago & it still had the same impact on me, what it had on the first watch !!Pulp fiction to me is not just a movie, it is a genre in itself...a result of Tarantino's wildest imaginations. It is a combination of 3 stories of the same world but with different protagonists, linked with each other in some way or the other. I was heavily confused about the plot of the movie after my first watch.....it slowly grew on me with time....it is one of those films, which will remain with me for years to come, aur jab impact kam hone lagega...i will watch it again !!The movie talks about the decisions that we make in our life and the unpredictability, fortunes & misfortunes of it.Violence is the heart of the movie & the way Tarantino blends it with his plot is a whole different chapter altogether. His violence is real, funny, unpredictable, sometimes horrifying and sometimes surprisingly exciting too(if there is something that i learn from movies, it's definitely not the violence...so chill)The background score, the songs, the camera work, the performances of the actors (especially samuel as jules, john as vincent, bruce as butch & uma as mia{fab of the lot}) are all very powerful & amazing. The direction of Quentin is simply unparalleled in this movie but the only thing that i don't like about this movie is his cameo(it looks a bit odd...idk why)My favourite parts of this masterpiece are....the dance scene, the car scene, the beginning & the ending scenes of the movie, comic reliefs, Jules quoting the bible and the sexual tension that builds between Mia & Vincent !!"
11 November 2001,prendevi,1,1,10,In my opinion this is definetley one of the 10 best movies of all time ***** out of five,Incredibly good. Not quite as good as Reservoir Dogs but but pretty close and anything that one would come in a mile of Reservoir Dogs must be incredible. In my opinion the greatest writer/director of all time Quentin Tarantino- who is my idle writes and directs this and incase you don't know wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs aswell. This really was and still is ground-breaking so clever and funny with great performences. In my opinion this and Dogs are far superior to the likes of The Godfather- not that that is a bad film thats fantastic but not nearly as good as this and Dogs (in my opinion) QTs next film after this was the excellent Jackie Brown and I can't wait for Kill Bill

3 February 2021,one9eighty,2,4,9,Do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France?,"After the success that he had with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back strong with his second written and directed full-length feature film, ""Pulp Fiction"". Some would argue that this neo-noir black crime film is his masterpiece. Like his previous film, this offers just as much violence and brutality, which again is wrapped up with lots of style and substance.This film has seven narrative sequences, with three primary storylines, which are all interwoven, making it a hard watch for some people, while others marvel at its construct. Mob hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the protagonist of storyline 1, Butch Coolidge the boxer (Bruce Willis) is the protagonist of storyline 2, and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the 3rd storyline protagonist. The film goes from a prologue (diner hold-up), to Vincent, Jules, and then Butch, before going full circle the epilogue and the diner hold-up again.I enjoyed this in the 1990's when I first watched it, and I've never shied away from watching it again given the opportunity. It might not be everybody's cup of tea and it certainly is not for the younger audiences (even of post 2020!), but I enjoy it and can appreciate its technicality. Having the benefit of 20+ years of hindsight it is interesting to see lots of films that have come out since and tried to replicate part of this film, most have failed too. It is a testament to how good this film is though that it can inspire other people to try, not just in film but other mediums too - games, comics, etc. If you have not seen this film it is absolutely worth a watch, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again and find something you missed last time - or discuss some of the themes, homages, or McGuffin's to try and work out your own messages (the gold light in the suitcase for example - I would love to believe it is Marcellus's soul. It ties in with the plaster on the back of his head, and with the combination of '666' on the briefcase - but this has been widely debunked). A cracking film and an enjoyable piece of art - one of Tarantino's finest films in my opinion."

14 January 2006,peteyob,16,34,2,Disturbing,"*a few spoilers below* I remember seeing this movie at a theater when it was first released. I was very excited and eager to see it as I had heard a lot of positive ""buzz"" about it. I was very disappointed for many reasons including: 1. Glorification of violence - all the ""cool characters are cold blooded murderers, drug abusers or sadists. I cannot identify or become emotionally involved with these type of characters. I didn't care if any of the main characters lived or died. In fact I would have preferred if they all died in the end because they were all terrible excuses for humans. 2. Attempting to mix realistic violence with humor. In the scene where the guy was accidentally shot in the back seat of the car, a few people around me laughed. Others gasped that someone would laugh. I will never forget the guy in the theater sitting behind me saying out loud ""wait, that's funny right? Isn't that supposed to be funny"" Many action films have cartoonish violence - it's understood that the violence is farcical. This movie seemed to be saying murder and rape are funny and cool. 3. The scene with the gimp was way over the top, not necessary, and sadistic. Again, is this supposed to be amusing and entertaining? 4. The dialog seemed to be random and unconnected and without purpose. People cite lines about McRoyal with cheese like it is profound. Is it me, am I missing something? 5. You have to completely suspend your disbelief at the coincidences that occur. A guy is driving on a random street and happens to pull right up next to the guy trying to kill him? I am at a loss as to why this movie is rater so high. It had some snappy editing, and a few genuinely humorous moments. But is was a film about nothing but a fictionalized underbelly of society."
25 August 2006,instigate_insanity,6,11,10,There's some gimpy sh#t going on here.,"I never thought it'd happen. I've seen a lot of movies. I've given a lot of high ratings. I've never before seen fit to give a movie a ten, though. But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.I avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.This manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.I must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.To those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.The film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.I have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.""Get the Gimp!"""

31 January 2000,afaix,5,8,10,I can't believe that I have to defend this movie.,"Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The ""pointless"" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The ""pointless"" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting: what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.  My apologies for the length."
18 October 2002,chris65203,7,13,10,The movie that changed movies...,"OK, first of all we all know that ""Pulp Fiction"" barrows heavily from other films (check out IMDB's movie connections link), but what really is the legacy of great films (""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""The Godfather"", etc.) is the way it influences all of its movie descendents.  With movies ranging from ""The Usual Suspects"", to ""The Matrix"", to ""Boogie Nights"", to ""Dogma"" it is very evident that such an impact has occurred.  When it comes to people, we say they will ""live forever"", in my mind this movie will be the same.10/10"

1 May 2004,dxia,4,7,10,Some People Just Don't Understand,"I won't hide the fact that my comments here are directed toward the people that don't like this movie, but my foremost goal is to clarify a few issues about this movie that some people just plainly don't have right.Issue 1: The movie is gratuitously violent!Well, yes and no. I admit that for it's time 'Pulp Fiction' seemed excessively bloody and does at times glamorize violence, but if you review the film frame by frame, you'll realize that most of the violence is implied. The famous needle scene and Marvin's unexpected end actually show less than you may think. Tarantino stealthily cuts away at the exact moment when the audience expects to see something gruesome, and everything that we think we saw only occurred in our imaginations. Now apart from those two scenes, there is a sword fight and a few executions, but none of them are as gruesome as what one would expect to see in action movies.The reason why people believe the movie is so violent is because of the extraordinary tension that Tarantino builds up in every scene. Bret's interrogation creates incredible tension because everyone knows that it will explode in violence, but they don't know when. Vincent's ""accident"" is excruciating to some people because they see the gun bouncing in Vincent's hand just before it discharges. People find it painful to watch because what they fear would happen is exactly what happens. I know some people dislike this movie because everyone laughs at the violence. They don't seem to understand that the audience is supposed to laugh. The laughter is there to relieve the tension because otherwise the movie really would be gratuitously violent.This movie is a caricature of criminals and neurotics, and the point is to watch them react to their world. Fans of this movie are not blood-thirsty and do not find it cool to kill people. What so many like about 'Pulp Fiction' is how Tarantino builds up his events and then pays them off so elegantly that some mistake it for a director trying to be cool. He isn't trying. He's succeeding very brilliantly.Issue 2: The non-linear story is confusing and pointless!This issue that some people have with 'Pulp Fiction' really bewilders me, and it's plainly obvious that the people who says it are conventional movie watchers who don't like to put effort into what they're watching. These mainstream movie-goers want plot points and character arcs that can be diagrammed. While there's nothing wrong with linear story-telling, non-linear movies can be a relief sometimes, especially when it's done well. 'Pulp Fiction' is a perfect example of non-linear story-telling because the movie cannot be told in a linear fashion!Think about what would happen. The movie would begin with Jules and Vincent, but then Jules' redemption would happen midway through the movie, Vincent would go on his date with Mia, and finally Butch would have his turn. The movie wouldn't make any sense! People would wonder why Butch was introduced so late, and Jules' redemption would feel less meaningful because it would no longer be the focus at the end. But as it is, the movie begins and ends perfectly. Tarantino introduces all the characters at the correct moments, and he places the chapters in such a way that it brings more focus on the characters rather than the plot. If the movie had ended with Butch riding away, it would have felt drab and awkward, but ending with Jules feels ennobling.Issue 3: The dialogue is meaningless!I know it shouldn't, but this issue really ticks me off sometimes because there's not a shred of truth behind it. It's like complaining that Mozart's music has too many notes. People complain not because there's too many, but because they're just too lazy to listen to all of it and interpret what it means. As Roger Ebert says, Tarantino's dialogue is ""load bearing."" Take the ""Quarter Pounder with cheese"" discussion between Jules and Vincent. Some may believe it's frivolous dialogue, but the information we learn from it makes a reprise in a later interrogation and initiates the mounting tension in that scene.The discussion of foot massages introduces the imposing threat of dating Mia Wallace, and Fabi's speech about potbellies is used to hide the fear in her situation. She's trying to comfort herself with pillow talk so that she won't have to talk about hiding from the mafia. Honestly, 'Pulp Fiction' is the most quotable movie ever made. At times, the dialogue sounds like poetry. The conversations do not jump or bounce, they flow and ebb with the sounds always hitting their emotional cues. It's a rare film that can be just as entertaining when listened to rather than watched.If you are one of those few that cannot at least appreciate how well Tarantino creates his characters and narrative structure, then don't bother complaining because I already feel sorry that you cannot enjoy the movie as so many do. At the very least, you should not criticize the movie with false and shallow comments. Because really, in the end, you're only embarrassing yourself."
19 March 2021,mustafa-moharram,3,3,10,Peak of Entertainment,"This movie does hit all the entertainment elements perfectly without sacrificing any.. Humor, Action, Revenge, Salvation and on top of it the much interesting dialogues which sometimes seem that they're not related however they fit incredibly well.
It's my all time favorite movie and nothing comes even close since I don't consider it as just a good or even great movie, but a unique sense of putting together whatever elements you need from a movie to be entertained, surprised and satisfied. This goes for QT as an extraordinary movie-maker!"
11 May 2010,fackjoley3,4,7,10,Possibly a perfect film.,"Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, but I'm yet to get tired of it. This masterpiece is fast paced, action pact and extremely quotable. Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus. The editing is interesting in that the film is told out of order and the audience has to see it more than once before they can start piecing it together. The directing is fantastic, as per usual with Tarantino. Further following an early Tarantino trend, he casts himself in a small role and as usual, it a terrible actor. Don't let Tarantino's poor acting deter you, the rest of the cast is amazing. Pulp Fiction is thought to be the film that brought back John Travolta's career, but there is much more than that. Nearly the entire cast are legendary actors. Furthering the Tarantino tradition, ""Pulp Fiction"" has an amazing soundtrack. There is nothing bad that I can say about this film. It is honestly the closest thing to film perfection that I can think of."
8 July 2010,russellt-766-50076,4,7,10,"Wildy entertaining,simply astonishing","Pulp Fiction is a crazy,wild ride of a movie and is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It effectively combines smart original dialogue, wildly entertaining plot lines and many memorable characters. This movie is Quentin Tarantino at top form,delivering what is his greatest film to date,and one of the best films ever made. I will say that I am not quite sure it deserves the number 5 spot on the IMDb top 250 list,not because I don't like it but simply because I think that there are better movies out there. But to get back on the subject this is an amazing film. It is stunning in its brilliance and a joy to watch. It can also effectively switch moods at the drop of a hat. Sometimes it plays like a buddy comedy,other times it is dark and extremely suspenseful.I will say that the only complaint I could ever see thrown at this movie is lack of emotional involvement or feeling. I get this way with most of Tarantino's work but with this film I really didn't care. It is just sheer brilliance,imaginative film making and excellent entertainment. An absolute must see"
13 November 2019,bowwowwowyippy,1,1,7,Overrated but good,I don't think this is QT's best work but it definitely has some memorable one-liners and great performances.
16 March 2022,stewartcarl,5,12,1,😴😴,"Like all of tarantinos films,they're just a load of stolen ideas and images of other films,but together to resemble something that people think is original,the bloke could'nt come up with an original film concept if he tried."
9 September 1998,fubar-2,8,21,2,Boring Movie,"I guess I just don't see what the hype is about this poor excuse  for a movie.  Yes, it has some good dialogue and acting and one or two good scenes, but otherwise it was just a long-winded bore, like all his other movies.  He'd be better off writing for the theatre where dialogue and acting are more the driving factors of the medium.  Oh, and when are you going to come out of the closet, Mr. Taratino.  That scene with Bruce Willis was just homo-erotic fantasy, plain and simple.  A theme that seems to run through all your films and performances.  Haven't you heard?  It's ok to be gay!"
14 June 2021,AuroraLaude,5,13,1,Cheap Rides & Plagiarism,"Quentin Tarantino is the used car salesman of Hollywood, and this film is just another previously-owned cheap ride. The glowing suitcase bit was stolen from the 1955 noir film Kiss Me Deadly. Samuel L. Jackson's bible-quoting hitman character was stolen from the 1973 Japanese martial arts film Karate Kiba. Tarantino takes four anecdotes and cuts them out of order to fool the viewer. Tarantino knows his story his boring, so he splatters blood around various sets, uses profanity to an extreme, and regresses to violence befitting of his character. His success is in knowing the vast majority of the public does not watch movies made before their own birthdate, so he can get away with cinematic larceny. At a Hollywood film panel, in 2006, a popular film critic called Tarantino a ""hack"" to which the audience applauded."
31 January 2007,yfguitarist,8,23,6,The hilarious misadventures in the life of a pair of murderers!,"Describe Pulp Fiction in one word: impossible. Because it's impossible to describe it one word, so I'll use many: a complex, interwoven modern day fable with characters as colorful as an Alice in Wonderland rendition. This film, on the surface, appears to merely be an exploitation flick, mindless in its execution and gratuitous in its violence. On the contrary! The violence, while shocking, serves the purpose of jolting us out of our everyday life - it speaks to us, and ABOUT us, in ways that your average Hollywood popcorn movie can. We get to see the humour in murder. Injected with black as night humour, it tells the tale of a group of criminals ""behind-the-scenes."" We see their everyday conversations, fueled by intellect, wit, and poetry, debunking the stereotype that murderers are devoid of any real intelligence. Pulp Fiction is a film for the ages.In all honesty, I gave this film a low score because it's ridiculously overrated. Personally, I can't stand hearing QT's pretentious dialogue and the ""look-how-cool-I-am"" style really grates on my nerves. It's pretty popular to like this movie, so maybe I just have to hate everything popular, but that's obviously not the case, so...I don't know what it is. Mass brainwashing and hysteria over this egotist that likes to write himself into cool parts in his films so he can suck women's toes?"

                        ",Tribute to On the Waterfront,"I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: ""In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.""Butch: ""In the fifth, my ass goes down.""Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In ""On the Waterfront"" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando ""coulda been a contender."" So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in ""On the Waterfront."" I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside."
21 May 2008,ygodson,1,1,8,a different experience,"No wonder Pulp Fiction will remain a cult classic and certainly one of the definitive movie in cinema history.The beauty of this classic is the variety of interpretation it allows.Multiple viewing always refines our thoughts about this movie. Parallel tales converging to a convincing ending is certainly a different genre.Tarantino and Guy Ritchi are the masters in this genre.Sometimes different screenplay makes a movie unforgettable and surely this was the case in Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction is a cult classic and one of the movie that will stay in the viewers mind for a long time but certainly not a popcorn movie(a spiritual movie in my opinion) . Pulp Fiction is a philosophical fiction with a tinge of humor added to it. S.L.Jackson was amazing as Winnfield and Thurman excels as Mia and not to mention Bruce Willis but I felt rather disappointed with Travolta. A very satisfying movie but not an entertaining(depends upon the way you define entertainment) one. I recommend ""Snatch"" and ""Lock,Stock.."",if you want a more entertaining movie from the same genre. My score 8/10..If you are a serious movie buff..Go for Pulp Fiction"
4 July 2016,leelacade,9,23,1,As Empty as a North Korean Grocery and Twice as Smelly,"Once again we have the phenomenon of Tennessee QT ripping off classic outside-Hollywood '60s and '70s fare, copying the superficial elements, and failing to deliver any kind of meaningful context. Hey, dude, there was a reason it worked in the first place. But, no, his acolytes will attend this latest black mass and congratulate each other on all the vacuous references they can recognize.This is a total rip-off of La Mala Ordina. The only thing he adds is some dialog between the hit men. He should've left it out if that's the best he can do.His biography should be out soon. If truly titled, it would be, ""A Typical Redneck Tries Art-house"". Sound pretty awful? Well, the movie is worse."
9 May 2018,aghauptman,5,9,9,Always entertaining,"I remember as a kid my Mom watched this movie when it came out (I was 10) and my brother and I were playing video games downstairs and we could hear my mom laughing upstairs and wanted to know what was so funny. But we knew it was a rate R movie and we couldn't go watch. Well I was so relieved and triumphant feeling when I was finally old enough to see it. It held up really well!! Tarantino may be a creep, and may have issues with acknowledging his whiteness and all but he does know hot to put together a decent movie. Perhaps one of the biggest accomplishments of this film in particular was reviving some Hollywood has-beens. John Travolta's career was 5 and a half feet under and Pulp Fiction basically revived him. He also threw in Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette who were not really super relevant anymore. I think at least when I saw this movie for the first time I also saw Bruce Willis in a darker role than I had previously seen him. I appreciate that Tarantino uses actors in ways we are not always used to seeing them. This movie has great action, good cutting between storylines, entertaining dialogue and per usual a killer soundtrack and of course plenty of the shock value we know to expect from his movies at the time. This is probably his best film for sure."
16 February 2020,Billybobble1,2,3,10,Tarantino's Magnum Opus,"As years pass and I get older, when speaking to people many years my younger and inevitably getting to the topic of movies and film, this is always the first one I enquire if they have watched, and also inevitably demand it is the next thing they watch.It remains possibly the most entertaining script to cross genres, I don't feel you can really pigeon-hole this to a genre, it has a bit of everything. It's one of a select few films you wish you could watch again for the first time, but watching it for a second, third, eighth, tenth time... it still feels fresh and still makes you laugh.The casting is just spot on, and the performances across the board are so memorable, even the bit-parts. I have watched this so many times I could probably recite the entire dialogue with a high degree of accuracy. As many a good film I have seen I would be hard pressed to state a better script, I can't think of many, if any lines of dialogue that don't need to be there. That is an outstanding achievement.
On top of this there's also the awesome soundtrack, when I first saw this I can't say I had heard any of the tracks before, subsequently it was one of the first soundtracks I bought the CD. As with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's choice of music was incredibly effective for the vibe of the film.There is some violence but it is not gratuitous and adds to the story. Now stop reading this and go watch it."
28 October 2012,cheryl-142-917207,12,29,1,Offensive,I am baffled by the users who rate this film so highly. If one deleted the N word and the F word there would be no script. How can we expect young viewers to treat people respectfully when Hollywood bombards us with racial slurs? Yes life imitates art although calling this movie art is a stretch. I read that Tarrantino is a high school drop out. Must be true judging from this script. I am certainly no prude or a stranger to adult themes and language. However the script was filled with glorified drug use and violence yet failed to show one ounce of Character growth. The barrage of profanity and violence was both offensive and boring. Quentin Tarrantino movies are on my list of films to avoid. Waste of time.

21 December 2008,elshikh4,4,13,3,Everyone Has Their Own Nonsense !,"Save all the sophisticated Yada, Yada, Yada, and all the smart Blah, Blah, Blah. I watched it 3 times trying my best to like it, though it failed big time to leave any effect but disgust, silliness, and provocative absurdity; and maybe that's Quentin Tarantino's original dream! It is the ultimate boring nonsense, and it's proud of itself too. OH MY GOD, how did Tarantino manage to persuade all of these stars to do it in the first place, I swear this is a mystery for me!Though, at certain corner in my mind, I have to ""respect"" its script somehow, because its unusual structure, and revolutionary sense. It succeeded in being a cheap novel which has been published cheaply in not well-ordered pages. It left its clear mark on all the crime movies later, with some followers that range between ugly and uglier. And still it's the most artistic movie made by Tarantino to date. WAW, I can be objective to surprising extent!But, in the same time, this movie is as dull as Harvey Keitel's face, as meaningless as Bruce Willis' role, and as unfunny as Uma Thurman is. It's wholly non-enjoyable, highly sickening, and a special torture to watch. I ranked it in my list of the worst 10 movies I've have ever seen, which makes me the biggest misfit among all the mad fans of it. It's the forever tragedy of being alone among a group that loves the usual: (2001: A Space Odyssey), (The Godfather: Part II), (Chinatown), etc.. as if loving them makes you a well cultured movie buff, and a venerable thoughtful brain! But you know what? I don't love them at all. I love (Die Hard), (The Guns of Navarone), and (The Boy Who Could Fly), and that doesn't make me trivial or ignorant, it just makes me someone with a different taste (or - sometimes - a taste!).Huh? It won the Oscar, So what? Some people gather yearly, at the Oscars or else, to select the fine movie from THEIR point of view, and simply this one isn't fine from MY point of view. I may care about its novelty, but I won't give a hoot about its characters, atmosphere, or world. Any movie that has Christopher Walken narrating such a nauseating story about some watch in some war--is definitely not for me WHATEVER THE GREAT MEANING BEHIND THAT ANYWAY! Even the plot, yes it's different and inspiring, but not brilliantly used. Its final result was something too ridiculous and cold. It's anti-formulaic, yet produced a sleepy doped up crime movie. It's not the case of style overwhelmed narration, it's a case of style killed narration (if there was any!), to show off what looked eventually like oddity for oddity.After so many movies by Tarantino, it's official: the man is a master of nonsense, who's so educated when it comes to the internationally cinematic nonsense history, and so creative in producing lots and lots of highly manufactured nonsense. However, sometimes he makes movies about uninteresting people by uninteresting ways, recycling the old nonsense into new forms, making it perfectly interesting for anyone but me. I don't hate Tarantino, but I hate Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction). Sorry, not my kind of nonsense."
25 September 1999,Wakuwaku,118,270,1,Extremely overrated!,"This is what I call a fad movie.  People say it is a great movie because other people said it is great.  People are afraid to express their true feelings because they don't want to be ridiculed by their friends, especially if one is a member of the so-called X-generation.  I would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high, especially for a movie that is considered a great movie.However, I concede that a number of people truly like it.  However, I find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie.  They just don't express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isn't worth the effort of making a negative opinion."

                        ",Crap Fiction!,"In a nutshell, the following elements causes a movie to be hyped beyond its own good:1.  Early trailers showing a movie with a huge cast, sex, drugs, and violence from a director who made an earlier hit and an underground genre as its subject.2.  After the trailer, it will respectively draw people in like sheep to see it.3. Sooner or later, there's a controversy about the movie's content, and yet it is still being raved about. Sooner or later the Academy of Motion pictures will knock on the director's door based on the amount  of sheep-people who love it.  It becomes a classic, and to those rare cases of actual humanoid lifeforms like myself, it's a hoopla B.S.Essentially, it's the hype that made this movie. If a film student approached a producer with the same idea, he'd get the hand. If you're Quentin Tarantino, you'd get Caviar and a warm welcome.  First of all, I didn't care for any one these characters. And where's the plot? Ooh, who needs one? Just turn these con men into philosophy majors, and have them drive around using four letter words all the time. Then make a bunch of vignettes out of this ""plot""! Someone gets a big needle poked through their chest because they overdosed on cocaine! Ooh, shocking! Pump up the hype! They took the scientologist star of Saturday Night Fever and made him disco dance again! With Uma Thurman yet! Some shocking stuff here! But what does it all mean? Is it supposed to prove that even the most sleazy  people are smart and intelligent? Does it mean rape in a VCR repair store could be a hype getter in another movie? Could it mean that the ""N"" word is okay to use as long as your name is Quentin Tarantino and you're just making a movie?The emperor has no clothes. Or is it the hitman has no clothes? Or the drug dealer has no clothes? Whatever."
29 August 2019,educallejero,9,37,1,"One of the worst ""movies"" I've ever seen","But... if this atrocity of a ""movie"" made Tarantino famous enough to make the really good Django, great Hateful Eight and amazing and elite Basterds, then at least something good came out of this awful disaster.Mediocre characters or just plain and simple annoying.
Idiotic dialogue without anything interesting or clever.
And a non-story of boring sequences (except the last part of the Mia/Vincent date, something close to 8 minutes? Maybe 10? In a 2.20h movie)Overrated won't even cover 10% of how inflated the perception of this is. The MCU is ""Godfather level"" compared to this crap."

Pointing a gun at somebody, cussing for 5 minutes, pulling the trigger, walking up to somebody else and doing it again for an aeon-like 2 hours is not very entertaining to me! There was NOT ONE stunt in this movie, and the camera angle never changed! And just when you think it's about to end, nope, it HAS to keep dragging on....and on....and on.

Then again, thank the maker it didn't win Best Picture!Rating: A much-deserved, exhaustive NEGATIVE 1 out of 10"

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"I must admit that I'm a little disappointed in myself for not having seen Pulp Fiction until very recently. It's something that I've always been meaning to watch, and you can never really go wrong with Quentin Tarantino. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is legendary, and although I am not a huge fan of John Travolta, I really enjoyed his performance as well. I absolutely loved the style of this film. The dialogue is so smooth and natural, and the way the different story lines intertwine just makes this movie that much more interesting and enjoyable. All of these little elements come together to produce a truly great film, one that I could watch over and over. Pulp Fiction is certainly a must see for everyone, whether you're a film buff or not."
12 May 2016,j-goslin,1,1,8,Wildly Exciting,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has gone down in history for the way it looks on screen and the messages sent throughout the course of the film. The film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. Sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. Another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. The subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story.
7 February 2001,scotty12,8,20,2,how great is this really?,"This film worries me.  Is it great as so many say?  It's riveting viewing that's for sure.  Movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better).  This film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth.The film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.It is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt.  Though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. Goodfellas). Rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know Mr Quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit.  You get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue.
Best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of Saturday Night Fever ended up!  I have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards.  I'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up.  And who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its British name) when it's called epinephrine in the US?  I'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life.  Most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. It's made to seem glamorous and seductive.  Anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen.  I think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie.  Again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein.  Maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)?Overall I think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing.  However it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness.  My opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost."
2 May 2018,loganalaxanian,5,9,9,Great Movie,"This movie is classic Tarantino with the use of his trademark camera angles, gore, and fowl language. This film is one of my favorite movies of all time because of how unique it is from other movies. The casting choice of Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta were perfect and can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The dialogue in this movie was perfect and is half of what made this movie so great. I also loved how the chapters in the movie were mixed up and really made you think when the movie was over. I recommend this film to anyone who loves fast paced movies with great dialogue."

Let me just say I want to go back and slap my past self. This movie is a master piece. From the naturally flowing dialog that talks about anything and everything, to the actual acting of the leads John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis. It has it's over the top moments, its plan weird and bazar moments, and its violent tingly moments. And rapped all together you get pulp fiction. Literally fiction that is complete pulp. The music also has to be mention as having a huge impact on the style and overall coolness of the movie"

Anyway, there's not much point in going into WHY Pulp Fiction is so great - everyone who's seen it, understands it. So I just wanted to say that it's one of the two movies that has got the ""Loved it"" rating from me at Moviecritic.com, alongside with Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"". A movie the world (or at least mine) could not do without."
10 May 2016,CriticalViewing,1,1,10,Such a strong use of dialogue! I love it!,"This film keeps the viewer paying attention as there is a lack of chronology in the telling of the narrative. However, this can be slightly troublesome during the first viewing of the film, but if one gives this movie the full attention it deserves, the characters (such as those played by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and the watch scene with Christopher Walken) and dialogue drive narrative carry this film from the on-screen start to the end credits. The acting in this film is great, the use of the soundtrack paired with the film editing is even better, both of these paired together create a well-thought out, story that will continue to be told for some time. It's one of those ""cult classics"" for a reason. Not to mention, the director, Quentin Tarantino, what a talent."

I really loved the partnership of Jules and Vincent also Honey bunny and Pumpkin were just perfect together. The opening scene to this film is one of the best I have seen."
7 June 2022,HotHamlet,1,1,8,Great Movie.,"Pump Fiction is a very good movie. Quentin Tarantino was one of those directors that everyone liked but I didn't really appreciate. But I finally found a movie that paints him in a better light.I thought the casting in this movie was it's strong suit as I couldn't think of another soul who could play better parts in this movie. The comedy some of the characters share together (especially John Travolta & Samuel L Jackson) where great and the characters where written in a very pleasing way.The story was good but this movie doesn't need a very elaborate story to drive it. That being said the story was absolutely fine and at times I was a little shocked. Like a certain death scene and a reveal about the opening scene.Action was good considering this movie was an all out avengers action blockbuster type movie. So if you only like action movies it isn't intense high octane stuff, but it should satisfy you. But as I said action isn't the main priority of this film in my eyes.The scenes are done so very well and the way the story has a scene take place before the scene prior is a nice mix up and genuinely fits the movie well (you need to see the movie to understand this).Bruce Willis was solid and Uma Thurman was fine, but the two boys of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta really stole it for me. Although Bruce's story and the scene with Uma where great too. Two serious additions to an otherwise not as serious movie.Cast - 9/10Story - 7.5/10Comedy - 8/10Action - 6/10Overall a great movie I would definitely recommend - 8/10."
12 April 2021,and-artuso,2,2,10,Thrilling and full of surprises,"This is the masterpiece of Quentin IMHO. You have to watch it , you need to watch it."
13 March 2010,dwf801,6,11,10,Best Movie of the '90s,"What is Pulp Fiction about? On the surface, it is about several unique people and how their lives connect in some way. The cast of characters includes a boxer (Bruce Willis), two gangsters (John Travolta), their boss (Ving Rhames), and his wife (Uma Thurman). The whole movie consists of several small stories that all connect to each other. One of them involves the two gangsters trying to get rid of a dead body and clean up the mess they've made. Another situation has Travolta taking his boss' wife out on a date, her overdosing on cocaine, and him trying to find a way to save her life. There are other story lines that I won't give away because part of the fun is seeing how everything comes together. But the story is not told in chronological order. It jumps back and forth between stories in a way that would normally be confusing, but the brilliant screenplay makes everything flow nice and smooth.If you like to look at movies for their meaning and artistic value, then you could say that Pulp Fiction is about how people have lost all meaning and value in their lives. Instead of having individuality, people define themselves by what they see in pop culture. The movie has endless references to pop culture and it seems that everything in the movie is inspired by some aspect of pop culture. This is not a lack of originality, but a way to show that everything we do is inspired by something or somebody else. A perfect example is when Bruce Willis' character, Butch, is talking to a Hispanic cab driver who asks him the meaning of his name. He says, ""This is America, honey, our names don't mean sh*t."" To me, the meaning of Pulp Fiction is that each moment has its own priorities. Something might be important to you at one moment in time, but in another not important at all. One minute you could be racking your brain over what you are going to say in your next Facebook status update, and the next you could have a gun in your face. People think they know what is important to them until something else happens that completely changes their priorities. Take, for example, the part where Butch Coolidge sees the man who wants him dead. At one point, they are trying to kill each other, and suddenly one is trying to save the other from getting raped by some psychos in a gun shop. When it is all said and done, they don't even care about why they were fighting in the first place because something bigger and more important is happening.One of the things that makes Pulp Fiction great is that if you don't want to think too much about the deep, philosophical meaning to it, then you can just enjoy the movie for what it is-a humorous, violent, and stylish portrayal of several characters and their encounters with one another. It has a little something for everyone, and the more times you watch it, the more you begin to understand and appreciate it.The genius of the movie comes out in its dialogue. Everything the characters say has meaning or it foreshadows something that is going to happen. For example, when Travolta and Jackson are talking, Travolta says that in France, a quarter pounder with cheese is called a ""royale with cheese."" Soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, Jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. He then uses the ""royale with cheese"" line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies.The Academy-Award nominated performance by Samuel L. Jackson creates one of the coolest, funniest, and greatest characters ever. Despite how crazy the whole movie is (and how ridiculous his hair is), we never get the feeling that he is acting. He makes us think that he is a real person and truly believes everything he says. It is very exhilarating to watch how he starts off as a mob hit man with little meaning in his life and transforms into a deeper, more self-aware person.Pulp Fiction is not only the best movie of the '90s, but it is one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. The first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. Watch the funny conversations between Travolta and Jackson, the funky dance scene with Travolta and Thurman, and all of the other moments that make Pulp Fiction a truly memorable movie.http://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/"
14 November 2019,xoxascott,2,3,7,Strong Movie,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made."
25 June 2022,jacobmiguelnogueramartinez,2,2,10,What can i say about Pulp Fiction ?,"This movie meant a lot of changes for the entire industry, the unusual way for telling us a story, main characters with unique personalities who swats tons of charisma, the music and photography take us back to the 90 years ... and we can't ignore every single detail that Tarantino placed in the whole movie is probably more essential than we thought. It's not a coincidence that many directors use Pulp Fiction like a guide for making their movies...It could be taken as a cliche comment, but Pulp Fiction is an obligatory date for every person, it doesn't matter what kind of movies are your favourites, trust me, this movie could hardly dissapoint you."
28 October 2004,XIOMANGER,4,7,10,Why can't there be a thousand movies as good as this one?,"The one thing that really makes this movie stand apart from all other movies is not the gratuitous violence, nor the philosophical issues it raises, not even the dialog. We've seen all that before in one movie or another, though perhaps not as powerfully combined as in this movie. The one thing that REALLY makes this movie stand is how much fun it is to watch it. EVERY SECOND of the movie is incredibly entertaining. Every of the several story lines is captivating, novel, unusual, and, quite simply, interesting. How can I ever watch conventional blockbusters after this movie?Some of the great precious things for me in this movie: the watch-in-rectum story, a disgruntled suburban asking his good old friend Jules who has just brought a dead body into his garage whether there was a ""dead n***er storage"" sign in front of his garage, the foot massage discussion, the thought of what will happen to Zed, Wolf's knack for solving every possible problem, the Quarter Pounder discussion (by the way, its true; you CAN buy beer in movie theaters AND in Mc Donalds in Europe) and of course the initial shootout. Watching the soon-to-be-dead guy tremble in fear as Jules skillfully leads the discussion (""breaking his concentration"" at times) is so much fun. There is a lot to be said also about the style of the movie. The dialog is of course legendary, and every line in the movie is infused with significance. While all characters really do seem like they are out of a comic book they all exude style. This makes their every action, as I said before, fascinating.The movie is quite violent. Even though the violence is stylized, it is depicted with scary realism and its full consequences, unlike action movie violence. When a guy's head gets blown off, we see it in all its glory, including our main heroes trying to ""pick up the pieces"" for the next hour or so. This is perhaps also one of the few movies that had the audacity to show a male-on-male rape and afterward the victim, having gotten the upper hand over the assailants, seething in anger and desire to extract unimaginable revenge, despite his calmness. Unlike in action movies, everyone is scared ****less when their lives are at stake, even though a sharp line is still drawn between the main characters of the movie and ""cannon-fodder"". This is also one of the few movies the ""n"" word is used so often, most of the times with just the right energy to have a hilarious effect. Quentin, in my opinion, rightly says in an interview that every time a word is given such a power, one should shout it out from the rooftops until the power goes away. Anyway, here's to Quentin remaining a prolific director for a long time in the future!By the way, if he ever decides to make a Big Kahuna franchise, he would be a millionaire.

11 May 2016,smcguirk-88356,1,1,10,One of the best movies ever,This movie certainly deserves the rating of 8.9 and deserves its spot ranked as the #7 movie of all time. Everything is fantastic in this masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino does a fantastic job directing this and not one actor or actress in the movie disappoints me. I personally love the plot of the three different stories that revolve around Marsellus Wallace. This films doesn't leave time for the viewer to be bored while watching since it is so pack full of complex and entertaining characters that bring their witty comments to the screen. There almost seems to be a natural flow between some characters and that draws you in and doesn't let you go for a second.

25 June 2016,urbanlegend23,1,1,9,"Not a film I feel passionately about, but still an undeniably fantastic second feature from Tarantino.","Quentin Tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent ""Reservoir Dogs"" in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered ""Pulp Fiction"" two years later. Commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. Many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer ""Jackie Brown"" - consider ""Fiction"" Tarantino's finest work. Countless film fans worship at its alter. Am I one of them? Not really. I think the film is fantastic for reasons I'll soon explain, but I don't passionately subscribe to it as Tarantino's best either. In fact, ""Django Unchained"" is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from ""Inglourious Basterds"" or ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (YES, I think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact).But why is this film so particularly popular? It's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. There's no wonder it won Tarantino and Roger Avary an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The technique on display only matches the words - Tarantino's patient, passionate direction and Andrzej Sekuła's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven.The film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. It never complies with Hollywood movie clichés, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing.Fans and viewers which of ""Fiction""'s distinctive four chapters is its best. Some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like Uma Thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. They'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero Butch Coolidge (perhaps a career-best Bruce Willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever Harvey Keitel-assisted murder clean-up. They are certainly the film's highlights for me. But the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic."

9 February 2008,mcrasterix,4,7,10,You think there's no fun in violence? You think again!!,"I wanted to see Pulp Fiction for a number of reasons, apart from the fact that everyone told me to watch it. I wanted to see if Tarantino was something beyond of what some told me as ""a pig of violence"" And indeed, the film is packed with guns, bullets and drugs all around, but all that is passed and accomplished by its mere feel. All movies have a feel, but there are few that set a standard like Pulp Fiction. A movie that, after watching, leaves you confused, punched and dizzy, with a dried throat and a big black smile on your face. Not even God knows how Tarantino did it, he created a new kind of black humor, and a touch that was later used in many ways, for other big ones like Anderson's Boogie Nights. This is one that I'll remind, it seemed to me like the kickoff point for so many other great stuff I had seen before, and it has make me see violence and blood in another way: If I hear twist I think John Travolta and Uma Turman, if I see a hand watch I see Bruce Willis, and I say to you all: I will never ever forget the ""Royale with cheese"" scene!!

31 December 2015,bsbulldogs,1,1,10,"A classic film that has permanently changed the way I see films. Witty, violent and spectacularly original, one of my all time favourites","At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well."

20 August 2013,forthosewhowait94,4,6,10,A Great Movie Experience!,"Pulp Fiction is a terrific movie! It has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. I love all of his movies and I never get tired of watching any of them! Pulp Fiction is just another example of how awesome Tarantino is as a film-maker.Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. Not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how Tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. For example: the connection between Marsellus Wallace's Band-Aid on his neck and the suitcase.There is a fan theory that says that Marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. The fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the Band-Aid on Wallace's neck. Tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. Personally, I think Tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. The acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and I couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters.When the film was nominated for all of those Academy Awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption were also nominated. But I won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. However, I believe Pulp Fiction deserved the Oscar for Best Original Script and I'm really glad it won! In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years."
29 January 2003,lists-9,6,16,2,Just Nasty,"Well made, competently directed, cleverly scripted: yes. But I've rarely seen such an unpleasant film. To me, Pulp Fiction summarises everything that's wrong with modern film-making. We are asked to laugh at someone being shot in the head, to find violence ""cool"" and to be entertained by murder and drug addiction. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic and I don't think I'm alone in needing some one to ""root for"" in order to enjoy a film.I hate to sound moralistic (I'm an atheist, but hopefully humanist). However, I have to side with the minority who found this film excessive in all the wrong ways. I find it genuinely disturbing that so many people enjoyed it."
9 December 2021,assignbydesign,1,1,10,Tarantino Silences the Crowd,"Possibly the greatest film of all time. A collage of images, stories and characters positioned in such a way that we tilt our heads in amazement trying to piece linearity to story arc. What we can take away is Tarantino's ability to revive a career (Travolta) and make one (Jackson) and still find a way to wrap a big kahuna burger into a tight foil. The soundtrack is also a clever collage, and so is each actor/actress handpicked and set neatly on the stage of a pulpy epic. And let's not forget about Willis, who, with his mademoiselle, adds another element to an already effective concept. After all, what's a gritty pulp crime story without its pugilist and his father's watch?"

I am first of all A Big Tarantino fan, but NO, i do not like Pulp Fiction and nothing will ever convince me to like it. The Film has become a victim of its own popularity, every knows the quotes and scenes. But that's all it is, a collection of witty dialogue. I Could not care who doesn't agree with me. I'll go as far to say I like the soundtrack, but that's it.If you want a Tarantino Film that's far better than this Overrated Junk, Watch Jackie Brown."
31 July 1998,Venom-5,40,128,1,Plotless,"To me the movie had no plot and was merely an excuse to depict one form of violence after another; with no intent to tell a story, make a point, or to get the audience intellectually or emotionally involved with the movie."
3 November 2019,tcorrell-69070,1,1,10,"One Of The Funniest, Most Shocking And Original Films Ever!","Quentin Tarantino is the only film maker that makes death so comical. Marvin accidentally getting shot dead in the backseat of Jules Winfield's car by Vincent Vega is one of the funniest, most classic scenes ever in a movie.Another one of the funniest, most classic scenes in a movie ever is Marseillus Wallace shooting his rapist in the groin and stomach. This movie will never get boring, no matter how many times I watch it.It's hard to believe Pulp Fiction is now 25 years old. The dialogue is still relevant today."
15 November 2021,joiningjt,7,32,1,2nd MOST OVERRATED movie since reservoir dogs!! MOST OVERRATED DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME!!! Watch the best HITCHCOCK!!!,"Tarantino is EXTREMELY overrated he wrecks every movie hes every made with gratuitous sex and EXTREME vulgarity. To me a great director doesnt need either. You want PHENOMENAL characters watch Tombstone see kurt Russell in a western with a REAL director. Its miles better than hateful 8. You want ultimate dialogue watch Bone tomahawk. This guy is a butcher he uses mother fu.... every other word in pulp fiction he has a guy on guy rape scene in hateful 8. I actually would have watched that with my dad but he wouldn't ever watch a movie with me again if he did. The actors in hateful 8 are PHENOMENAL but the added bullshi. Wrecks it. Pulp fiction is all over the place and the best scenes according to critics and viewers are ALL VULGARITY AND VIOLENCE AND RAPE!! Quit saying how great he is, his movies are over the top violence, vulgarity, and out right BORING!! The best director EVER. Was Alfred Hitchcock!!!by a fricking mile!!"
20 February 2018,Vector18,9,19,2,Overrated,"In my opinion one of the most overrated movies of all time. This is the worst Tarantino movie out there, I dont understand the movies popularity. Its just so bad and it doesnt make any sence. But on the other hand the acting is good and Samuel L Jackson is as good as you can expect. I guess it is just not for me and maybe you will like it."

Q takes us on a roller coaster ride with his words.  After the film has ended you'll find your self going back, just to try and memorize the amazing one liners.  His characters are extremely likable despite there flaws, and there are some moments in the film that will stay with you forever!A testament to great writing and other movies had tried to copy the style of Q's film..........some have succeeded, but most have failed because there is only one PULP!"

It has an oscar winning script, great characters and some career performances from Jackson, Willis, Travolta and Thurman.This movie is so clever and well thought out. Some people find it confusing. Rubbish!. The structure of this film is one of the things which makes it so good and original. when put in chronological order, the story makes complete sense, the stucture is not a gimmick.The cast of this film is truly excellent. Travolta got nominated for best actor at the Oscars but lost out to Tom Hamks (who was truly deserving as forest gump but, IMO, not as much as Travolta was as Vincent). The character of Vincent is a scumbag but Travolta's performance makes him lovable and funny and likable. Sam Jackson also puts in a stunning performance (The scene in the diner is truly stunning acting).I could talk this film up all day but i wont. Just go see it and you'll see for yourself how films should be made."

It's true.And out of all of these brain-dead conversations that took place the most brilliant ""factoid"" brought to my attention was that in France, at their McDonalds, they actually (get this!) put mayonnaise on their french fries.(Gasp!)

When I bring up how disgusting this picture is to people whom love it, I get a multitude of answers that amount to nothing more than academic masturbation. Some people have the audacity to say it is a comedy. Somehow , I never thought mindless killing and standing around and laughing about it was comedy. ""Ha ha ha ha, he just got his head blown off"". ""That was so damn funny that I can't stop laughing."" Other people say it's a serious satire. ""It's supposed to show you the way the world really is."" Wow like I need to waste my time and money to tell me we live in a sick world. Simply put, if you like this film, you need to get your head examined."

                        ",Flawed.,"Yes, I admired the unique narrative of Pulp Fiction, and yes it was entertaining, but come on... you gotta bunch of people waving guns around in a wide open restaurant (including a black man who previously murdered 3 white men earlier in the day) with about 30 hostages for which seems to be about a half hour, and no cops show up?! And to add insult, this black man takes the time not only to recite a line from the Bible, but to also interpret what he feels this line means to him! It's obvious cops aren't in this movie because the criminals act as if they don't exist. I mean they really ACT AS IF COPS DON'T EXIST. And I thought Tarantino's repeated use of the N-word was low class, unfunny, uttered simply for shock value, and painfully obvious being that we knew he was going to have a black wife, didn't we? It's like someone diving into the water, but not wanting to get wet. Having said that, I enjoyed Pulp Fiction. But how could anyone think this flawed film deserved to win Best Picture. 2.5 stars."
14 August 1998,Sickfrog,2,3,10,An Amazing New World,"What ""Pulp Fiction"" does is not give you the normal, rinky-dink, Point-A to Point-B, generic movie. The film isn't about plot progression. What Tarantino does, in essence, is create an entire world. This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this ""morally ambiguous"" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry. So obviously, it must have something going for it."
16 March 2014,BA_Harrison,1,2,10,Tarantino's magnum opus.,"Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10."
13 February 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,4,12,6,Quentin Tarantino once again slips up,"After opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'Reservoir Dogs' Quentin Tarantino followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction'. Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.The film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.The first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.Technically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the ""sound"" than the ""look"". There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.In the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points. It entertains and it has some solid acting-Tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again.6/10"
10 November 2006,energyman-speed,10,25,4,One of those movies you just can't hate,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that is certainly original.. there is no movie like it.. However, there does not seem to be much of a plot or a message.It is like 3 totally unrelated stories about gangsters, crime, robbery etc with a lot of language and way too much detail.. I read in another review suggesting me to watch the movie twice to really pick up the detail and understand it, but the truth is that you cannot watch a hardcore 3 hr movie without a message again! None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.But one thing in Pulp Fiction's favor is the cast.. I thought that the 2 lead actors (Jackson and Travolta) were really good..In the end, I have failed to figure out why this movie was such a big hit, but I do not discourage you from watching it since you could have a totally different opinion about a unique movie like this."
15 January 2003,mgirl,6,14,8,And the point was,"I picked this movie up from the video store and watched it last night. I mostly got it hearing that it was a great, one of the best movies of the nineties. I have to say I was let down. Yes, it was a very intriguing piece of fluff (considering it was about violence). I mostly found it very funny at times, the way these mean gangsters act like regular people. For example, Vincent and Jules are calmly discussing the level of intimacy a foot massage implies right before they go inside an apartment with guns to teach some twenty-somethings a lesson. However, when all is said and done I felt as if there should have some point to the movie. The only characters who evoked any sympathy were minor characters. I will confess I totally loved ""The Bonnie Situation"" sequence, but it was way too short in comparison with some of the rest of the movie. I wish the whole movie was that light-hearted or had expanded the story out for two hours. On the other hand, I was almost bored during the story about Vincent taking Mia to the restaurant. Overall, it was a good movie, but the quality changes throughout."
25 February 2016,kmill-19623,1,1,8,Good movie.,Very well made movie great acting there were many different plot twists and turns in the movie. I personally myself did not like the movie I thought it was very dull and to not make sense at times many other people find it amazing and a great movie but that is why we all have different tastes and likes when it comes down to movies music Exedra. The director of this film is usually not one of my favorite that could possibly be why I do not enjoy the movie as much as other people have it was a well made movie with lots of great acting and lots of famous actors and actresses. A lot of the story just made no sense to me on why they would do certain things or why they were acting in certain ways that they were like I said this movie was not for me but I know many people out there have really enjoyed it throughout the years.
13 December 2020,amanshersia,4,6,10,Fabulous movie must watch,Rough and raw crime drama comedy movie and with some dark humour
25 December 2015,grantss,1,2,10,Brilliant beyond comparison,"Brilliant beyond comparison.Set in the world of LA gangsters, the intertwining stories of two gangsters, their boss, his wife, a boxer...and a couple who hold up restaurants. From the outset, the stories are clearly not parallel, but don't appear that closely linked either. However, they all eventually coalesce...though not necessarily in chronological order...A mind-blowingly brilliant movie from master-writer-director Quentin Tarantino. This was his second feature film, after the almost-as- brilliant Reservoir Dogs. While Reservoir Dogs was a film noir-type crime-drama, Pulp Fiction created a new genre (and prompted many attempts at copying Tarantino's style). Pulp Fiction has the film noir elements - the gritty crime-drama, the clever, solid plot, the hard-edged characters. Yet is has even more: great humour, incredibly snappy and clever dialogue, the coolest, swaggering characters and clever little sub- plots. Add in the time-jump element which adds to the intrigue and originality and you have the greatest movie ever made."
24 August 2014,gr8ful2u2,11,22,6,Good Yet Over-rated,"Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a ""genius"".The problem with ""genius"" is that what is genius to some is mundane to others. Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantino's later films."
4 April 2007,vg_slietian,31,71,1,the worst movie i have ever seen,i don't why people had ranked this movie so high but there is nothing in this movie which is good expect john and Jackman Samuels acting.................this is slowest movie i have ever seen the parts like start with boss wife is not needed..................... when i have seen rating of this movie i was really exited to see it i bought the movie CD when i stated watching movie is good at start it attracts mine interest but after the two stories the third seems much boring and after that the others are also boring and does not make any sense i thought that there will be any suspense in the last part but what i thought was crap so movie is much much below mine expectations.......
31 May 2020,lshu-34187,1,1,9,Pulp Fiction,"The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused.

29 May 2020,ylings-98434,1,1,7,Pulp Fiction,"Every plot is tense and frightening. The story seems to have nothing to do with it, but it's closely related.

When seeing it in the theatre, my wife and I walked out and demanded our money back.  I've never seen the full movie...I couldn't stand it.  I've even rented it again, thinking I must have missed something...but turned it off 3/4 of the way through, thoroughly disgusted.Why was this movie rated so highly?  I think it is a sign of our times. Drugs are everywhere, and violence sells.  Rather pathetic, but true.  Says something about the decadence of our society.  Are we at the end of another Roman Empire?  Is it all downhill from here?"

I like being able to see life through the eyes of someone else.  Everyone has their own interpretation, and this film is Quentin Tarintino's view on life.  There are a large group of people out there who follow Tarintino's career and praise his genious and mastery at story-telling.  I am not one of them!To me, Pulp Fiction was a horrible film!  I thought the plots were boring, I thought that the movie was a waste of time, and I feel that way about everything that Tarintino has put out!  All he does is recycle the same garbage over and over, and the public praises him for it.  From my perspective, the only thing that I see in the film that I would consider an original idea about this film is the manner in which the story was presented (ie the sequence of events being presented as they were.)  However, if you really want to see a great and unique approach at story-telling, watch Memento!What it all boils down to is that I don't believe that Quentin Tarintino is any better a director than Britney Spears is an actress; but that's just my opinion!I Rate - * 1/2"

Unfortunately, the almost non-stop foul language takes away some of the power and enjoyment. One great thing about this type of movie is the intentionally unintentional humor out of genuinely bizarre situation. Some may find the scene of Jimmie in the kitchen hilarious, but I feel it's ruined by the over-acting of Tarantino and the expletive-filled rant which sounded forced and fabricated, losing the edge of unintentional humor and genuinely bizarre situation. Luckily, the scene of Jules in the diner with Ringo and Yolanda had very little foul language, but it's the most powerful scene. There are other places where few or no expletive could make the humor and/or drama just as gripping if not more so. Overall, a 7 out of 10."

Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman was extraordinary.I recommend this movie to you because I think that movie reflects the new generation that came with Quentin Tarantino at the wheel!"
1 September 2002,lonsdalegeezer,8,14,9,"""Take a trip with me to a masterpiece of the 90's""","PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.If extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.On the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.The major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.This is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.The camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more."
7 November 2020,briancham1994,1,2,8,Tour de force,"There's quite a lot going on in this film - it has one of the longest Wikipedia articles I've seen for a single film.

This film is a blend of postmodern references, meandering characters, violence and intersecting storylines all borrowing from a shared lexicon of lowbrow media (hence the title). From the beginning to the end, everything is constructed masterfully. Every little detail, every line of dialogue, every gunshot has its purpose. I won't say this film is perfect but the level of purpose and skill are unparalleled."
3 February 2020,southdavid,1,2,10,12 out of 12 (Imperial System),"My Tarantino retrospective continues with ""Pulp Fiction"" a film I know well, and love. Having been slightly underwhelmed by ""Reservoir Dogs"" a few weeks back I was delighted to find that ""Pulp Fiction"" is as Iconic as ever.Told with a convoluted timeline, ""Pulp Fiction"" revolves around two Hitmen, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal Kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. Wallace then arranges for fading boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when Butch double crosses him, Wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them.Iconic really is the only word that fits. Each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. So many sections have been parodied in things like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Spaced"", the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. The jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. There is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order.Visually, it's a step up from ""Reservoir Dogs"" as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. Performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of ""Dogs"" Q.T was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. Samuel L Jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. Every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) Iconic. The music choices are fabulous - just as they were with ""Dogs"". Every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly.It's not totally perfect though. Tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. He's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the N-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like Jules would let him get away with it.That though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in Tarantino's catalogue (I'll see as I check out the rest)."
4 August 2020,kimmykat-99105,5,6,10,"Still, his best movie.",It has been almost thirty years and this film stand the test of time. I loved it the first time I saw it and I love it still. The weaving of these storylines and the intricate twists and turns have never been matched. This is new wave filmmaking at it's best. It will be studied and discussed in film schools all over the world and lauded as the best of it's kind in filmmaking history.
12 January 2016,Floated2,1,2,8,Transcends through quality,"Pulp Fiction as with any landmark movie, more has been written about it than would surely. The type of wild and hysterical ranting that has surrounded this picture can be a little off-putting. But it's hard to over sell a movie that is so supremely confident in writing and direction. Despite an almost audience-annihilating run time of nearly two and a half-hours, it is consistently absorbing.Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies. As with many films considered classics, Pulp Fiction may seem out of date to many viewers watching the film for the first time, in recent memory."

29 July 2000,edinger,7,20,2,What's all the fuss about?!,"What is it about this movie. Why do people hold it at such high regard. I simply don't get it... In my opinion the story is vague, the dialogue stupid and the performances, well, average.Certainly, Travolta made a bigger impression in the much underrated eighties suspense-drama ""Blow Out"". For great Sam Jackson performances, look no further than 96's ""A Time To Kill"".Besides, I didn't like the score either..."
4 December 2020,aljhayes,5,6,10,Spectacular masterpiece,From the moment the movie starts it is captivating. with its non-linear story structure allows you to jump into your favorite scene and or watch the scenes in the order in which you feel is best.
13 May 2002,rodentsfoe,24,58,1,Overrated,Highly overrated and unnecessarily crude.  Can't believe what some people see in this one.  Wastes the talent of the great Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman on vapid script by then-newcomer Tarentino.  Wish I could give it a negative rating.
25 March 2017,Movie_Muse_Reviews,1,2,10,"Tarantino's brilliant script both imitates and digs into pulp, uncovering meaning and richness","When Quentin Tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. The auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with ""low brow"" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. Essentially, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say.""Pulp Fiction"" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. The brilliance of Tarantino's screenplay (with story help from Roger Avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways. Act I, ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife,"" is the film's most memorable. The stylization, the quotable dialogue and Uma Thurman's tantalizing presence as Mia Wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film. It begins by introducing us to Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two black tie hit men working for Wallace (Ving Rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of Wallace's. En route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in Paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. The feel echoes Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in a lot of ways. We then follow Vega in a classic ""take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her"" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry.Act II, ""The Gold Watch,"" introduces us to aging boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) as Wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. We also learn about Butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. There's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as Butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (Maria de Madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. As we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil — or bad vs. ****ing evil — start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment.Act III, ""The Bonnie Situation,"" takes Jules and Vincent down a peg as they too get ""lucky"" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named Wolf (Harvey Keitel). The whole ordeal has Jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune.By digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, Tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. He proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. A notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end.As a director, Tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. It has remained his calling card ever since. Nobody can craft a modern day Mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. He also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. He goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story.The greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. Vincent and Mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell;"" Christopher Walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young Butch —Tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story.Yet the literary quality that Tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. Even just the Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to Vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films.""Pulp Fiction"" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other ""lesser"" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. It certainly gave Tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. From spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
18 January 2001,LeFreak-5,7,17,5,Gratuitous Violence Masquerading as Art,"I know this casts me as one of those who Don't Get It, but all of the raving about this film, and Tarentino in general, makes me want to vomit.Pulp Fiction is offensively violent. The clever plot, amusing dialogue, and eye-catching cinematography just can't cancel that out for me.5/10 -- and that's being generous."
8 February 2017,Kingslaay,3,11,4,The most overrated movie in film history,"Pulp Fiction has be the most overrated and over hyped movie of all time. It is absolutely bewildering and mind bogging how such a film received such praise. Tarantino is a great director but this movie is by far his worst production. A number of people criticize the non- linear storytelling and some vigorously defend it. But I feel movies need to add value, you walk away enjoying the experience. Movies are not made well just for the heck of it. Pulp fiction in no way adds value. It is a disorganized mess with fruitless story lines. The only redeeming aspects of this circus of a film is the acting and soundtrack. People rave about this mediocre film, well they also sold a lot of tickets on the Titanic."
4 February 1999,dynagirl,6,17,4,Pulp Directing,"Quentin Tarantino should have his director's license revoked (or at least be banned from the editing room) for this awful piece of garbage. The movie as a whole was a hack job of mismatched scenes, purely designed to hide the flimsiness of the story and mask the crudity of his directing.The film has some masterful stand alone scenes and Tarantino should have stopped there. His calling is short films, not features. Even the superb acting (no, not you Quentin) can save this ""film."""
12 March 1999,theazz,23,62,1,Don't believe the hype,"Sucked in by the tremendous hype surrounding this movie, I went with eager anticipation.  As I waited (and waited) for something to happen in this long-winded spectacle of gore, I found myself laughing only to break the tension. I was ashamed for finding humor in the most inappropriate moments of this film.Over-indulgent pop-icon Quentin Tarantino should head back to the video store so as not to inflict this kind of mess on innocent filmgoers again."
26 August 2016,Breachdk,4,6,10,A must see.,"This is my first review, so don't judge too hard(Pretty much wrote it, only to complete my profile). I was 16 when this movie came out, and I remember how good every said it was. To be honest, after I saw it, I didn't understand what all the hype was about. Later I decided to give it another chance. This time It was a totally different experience, it was like it all came together. I have loved the movie ever since, and I must have seen over 10 times now. The acting is sublime. The story is awesome. The dialog is captivating. This movie sat Quentin Tarantino's name stone as one of, if not the best director of all times. Not only this one but pretty much all of his movies is a treat for the eyes and ears. It's A must see movie!"

You end up listening to his story secondhand...I also hate that Pulp Fiction is lack of soundtrack.If you love Family Guy, big chance you will love this movie. The fact that the dialogue in this movie is blast of randomness without any coherence whatsoever, reminds me of family guy random jokes. To be honest, I really hate random dialogue in a film, many of the conversation in this movie is not sync with the actual plot.I don't understand why people love this crap. Guys, don't you realize that even Tarantino does not stay with this random dialogue kind of writing. The way I see it he wrote better story after Pulp Fiction, for example Django Unchained is well written with coherence dialogue and actual plot with a message. The funny fact is Django Unchained has lower rating than Pulp Fiction.Such a shame...rating 5/10, PS: even the writing is random crap, Pulp Fiction has amazing casts."

19 July 2000,Marvin Oatmeal,5,8,10,Revolutionary Film making,"With his 1994 film Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino perfected his unique style of fractured narrative, explosive film making. Whereas the earlier Reservoir Dogs contains elements of the corrupted, overlapping narrative, it delivers its stories clumsily, only hinting at the overwhelming, challenging style that Pulp Fiction would eventually bring. His influence is evident in the way that so many young emerging film makers have emulated his rapidly delivered story lines and fractured narrative structure, from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels through to Go, or Run Lola Run. He remains one of the world's most influential and gifted film-makers, and Pulp Fiction is clearly his most impressive work to date."
25 November 2019,davidmvining,1,2,10,"Not as fresh as some said, but just as great","Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.It's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.In every story, from the dual framing devices (the café and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as ""the man in Amsterdam"". One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.Of course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.Taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.The second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.There's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.The third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the café that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.Thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.So, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.No wonder it made such a splash."
21 June 2002,onepunchmachinegun,6,12,10,Brilliant movie.,"The movie has its own spirit. The realistic rude behavior every actor pulls in the films makes the movie complete.Warning! Warning! This may destroy some of the experience if you haven´t seen the movie yet. If you already have seen it, check this out! The briefcase Vincent and Jules are going to pick up over at Brad´s place. You know there with the Big Kahuna Burger. The briefcase has a code lock. The code is 666. I don´t know if Tarantino is christian or satanist, but take it as a symbol. Every time somebody sees the content of the briefcase they go, wow! Their eyes are glowing with greed. It´s the temptation. Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is the devil. Trying to buy Butch Cooligde´s (Bruce Willis) soul or just trying to get him to take a dive in the fight. Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the good man. Sees the shoot-up mistake in Brads place as ""divine influence"". Switch some of the letters in Jules and you get ""Jesul"", close to another name. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the bad man. He denies that there is such power controlling the universe in the ways Jules thinks. Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is just another human satan uses to tease Vega. Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) is the demon that frightens the good man. Do you see the posibility, as Jules, or is it just coincedences, as a true Vincent?  Now see the movie again and think of the posibility and make up your point with the movie!"

and I entirely focused only on the story-line but after a repeated view I just fell in love with this movie I ain't got mich to say about this film since everyone said about its originality,non linear story yelling and its masterful screenplay.All I can say is the movie is worth the love and the appreciation it got and it is one of the best movies ever made."
3 April 2002,soonerpike697,1,1,10,Best movie ever made funny as hell,"Best movie of all time.  Quentin Tarantino may be the best story teller of all time.  His direction was something few can match.  The man is a genious why Travolta and Jackson walked away empty handed I will never understand. Anyone who didn't appreciate this film is a damn fool.

20 September 2016,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction: the film that's redefined indie cinema.,"Quentin Tarantino knows how to direct an absorbing story and give a movie near-sentient energy of its own. Pulp Fiction is a funny, mysterious, and gorgeously written movie that's a time-capsule for the 90s, like Back to the Future was for the 80s. Pulp Fiction is a darkly humorous, colourful and hard-to-guess story that's still loved to this very day, and for damn good reason: it's a film that has a little bit of something for everyone.Just like nearly every other Quentin Tarantino movie, the story is non-linear, stars Samuel L. Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!' This film is basically its own classic moment; from Vince's dance with Mia, to Butch's moment with the Taxi driver, everything is just so well done and just right."
17 June 2009,sshaikh3,1,1,9,dunno why i didn't like this movie at first,This in my opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino movie ever I have to admit I don't know what was wrong with me that I didn't like this movie at first really don't know what was wrong with me maybe the scenes are slowly detailed but this movie has the best dialogues a really good concept people like the simplicity of this movie that is why this is so good and it's emphasis alone on dialogues and the fact that this movie was made in a really simple time Quentin Tarantino with his best friend Roger Avary managed to do something different something new which makes this movie far better than Kill Bill Vol.1 or Reservoir Dogs those movies don't have what Pulp Fiction has that is why this movie is so good.
7 December 2016,areatw,1,2,9,Refreshingly unique,"Like most people, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' and found it to be a refreshing change to the predictable and stereotypical drama/action movies we are used to seeing. 'Pulp Fiction' rips up the rule book and completely rewrites it.The film is bizarre, but not in a way that disillusions the audience. Instead, it's thoroughly gripping and demands attention. The dialogue is probably the best part of the film, you could tell from the opening scene alone that this is no ordinary dialogue and no ordinary movie.Good stuff, kept me entertained for the full 2hr 30m run time. Not a film I would consider among the best I have ever seen, but a refreshingly unique movie that I would happily watch again."
15 December 2016,daxbeach,1,1,9,All over the place!,"Vengeance and violent justice are really the premise of this story. Or rather, the FOUR stories intertwined in this film. This film really marked the 1990s as a special decade for US film. The film, and its intertwined stories, go back and forth, bounce between each other for a while, then crescendo into an explosion of violence and justice perhaps, towards the end. We even had a hit-man go clean and profess that he will be a holy monk and wander the earth in peace! The filming techniques are camera use are incredible, and the casting made careers for younger actors (and revived a few, for older ones!). it is my understanding that Tarrantino's editor for Pulp, is the same woman he has used in every film since!"

                        ","A fun, devilish watch","Pulp Fiction (1994), Quentin Tarantino produces what he is know for today, a dark, witty, and captivating film that has a disjointed flow of time but no pacing issues because of it. The film is excellently shot with great use of lighting and scenery. Where this film really shines though is the captivating dialogue and riveting characters. You're attention as a viewer is completely locked into what these characters are going to say next. While not my favorite Tarantino flick it is arguably the most recognizable in the mainstream and for good reason, it's a must watch."
5 August 2018,drjpdenis,12,27,1,What on earth is the fuss about,I never liked this film. Horribly overrated.see the review by adam G for a better worded and longer winded explanation of my feelings on this movie.
3 March 2017,CuriosityKilledShawn,2,7,6,It lives up to its title,"Now that it's almost 23 years later can we have a level-headed point of view on this movie? The hype machine in 1994 went into maximum overdrive with Pulp Fiction in a way that has rarely been repeated, even in a world over-saturated with easily accessible and multiple forms of media. For years people have regarded Pulp Fiction as if it is somehow far beyond any kind of criticism. It's time for scrutiny.As a 150-minute series of vignettes within vignettes it makes for good entertainment the first few viewings, but I've seen Pulp Fiction from beginning to end about 10 times now and I can honestly say I am done with it.The trashy nature of the stories and the wider world that the characters inhabit is a nice homage to the dime novels of the 1950s and other trash cinema of the era. And I mean trash. Pulp Fiction takes virtually no inspiration from anything with an ounce of class. Don't be fooled by the all-star cast and the larger- than-life characters.For years people have been quoting the screenplay as if it were a breathtaking breakthrough in movie dialogue. It's not. If anything it is far too wordy. The editor should have been a little more liberal in cutting down the talking. There is an utterly pointless interaction between Travolta, Thurman, and Buscemi about a $5 shake that seems to go on forever. It adds absolutely nothing to scene at all and I cringe whenever I hear it. I can't believe I am even wasting my time bringing it up in this review, but it's a good example of frequent nothingness that should have been excised. Tarantino also seems to have an inability to reign in his actors here, leaving them to ham their way over the boundaries which gives many characters an unfocused, disconnected, and confusing riff. Travolta in particular seems off and alienating. He was probably just happy to get work at the time but there's no reason for why the rest of the cast didn't question the overwritten material.It's also very dull to look at. Jack Rabbit Slims appears to be the only set specifically designed for the movie, which is why there is a colorful vibrancy to this scene that is found nowhere else. Almost every other shot takes place at street level in the most mundane parts of Los Angeles without any sense of location. The lazy Panavision photography just plonks the camera down at standard angles and indulges in far too much steadicam for its own good, all while never giving us much in the way of geography. It's very frustrating.Pulp Fiction is competent with unique inspirations, but the movie has almost no original ideas and it has been massively over-regarded for far too long."
23 November 1999,BB-15,3,9,6,Mixed Bag,"Plenty of people love this movie. They rave about how original, cool and funny it is. I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the ""N"" word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone."
8 January 2001,Rinho18,5,17,6,Not good,"Pulp Fiction is not a good movie I think. It has some enjoyable moments, but it is actually too confusing, because of the time and place´( they ALWAYS change! ). That is not good for a movie, I think. I do not think that it is one of the best 25 films ever. I mean, what is the great thing about that movie? It is just another piece about drugs and killing each other. Come on?! I rated it a 4/10, because it is quite original and has some funny jokes. But it is definitely not that good."
29 November 2014,Rickting,2,6,6,Am I allowed to disagree?,"The fact that an aimless, jarring mish mash of swearing, violence, gangsters, foot massages, royale with cheese, accidental shootings, interrogations, robberies, yelling and a load of characters without any actual character being badass defined the 90s show the 90s was a mixed decade from film. Quentin Tarantino's legendary drama thriller is a non linear collection of various story lines. In one, a very bizarre robbery unfolds at a diner. In another, Vincent Vega has to look after his boss' wife for an evening and they dance, she overdoses and they exchange awful jokes from a pilot she was once in. In another, Butch Coolidge gets into a lot of trouble when about to flee LA... all for a watch. And finally, Vincent and Jules assassinate a man, then have to dispose of a corpse after Vincent has an accident involving a gun and their informant. Don't get me wrong: Pulp Fiction is a good enough film it's just very over-hyped. However, you can almost see the sparks flying as the actors deliver that electric dialogue. It's a script that will make all aspiring scriptwriters jealous.Quentin Tarantino's direction is very good as well and the film draws out career best performances from Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis. John Travolta and Uma Thurman both rock. There are some good bits: The gold watch speech, the dance, the interrogation, the accidental shooting and some of the Bruce Willis segment showcase the amazing writing. However, many other scenes feel banal and unnecessary. Reservoir Dogs was utterly brilliant, so Tarantino got arrogant and made a bloated 2 and a half hour epic which could have 100 minutes. The film has little personality and lacks any kind of message. There's nothing wrong with that, but if I spend 2 and a half hours of my life watching unnecessary scenes I want there to be a purpose. Pulp Fiction is just too long and self indulgent to be a great film. It has plenty of style and is very well written but it's nothing special. Critics never shut up about modern movies being style over substance, yet this is voted one of the best films ever made when it's exactly that? 6/10"
8 December 2016,g-britosgutierre,1,1,10,One of the best films seen yet..,"Tarantino wrote a screenplay with Roger Avary for one of the greatest films of all time. Amazing shots but an even greater cast brought together by Ronnie Yeskel and Gary M. Zuckerbrod. Each performer brought emotion, hilarity, and a sense of realism to the scenes. One specifically, Uma Thurman's scene as Mia going through an OD, the seriousness within the scene on each character's face and the stillness of Thurman's person and aftershock was scary real. Viewing this from two different age groups (my younger brother saw it with me) we saw the characters had depth and the cast altogether was hand picked to perfection. It's no wonder the box office first weekend alone had brought more than triple the budget! Would greatly recommend to anyone!"
11 April 2021,jakethesnake-42007,1,2,10,A masterpiece that changed cinema,A pure masterpiece that changed the way we see film. I remember watching the film for the first time when I was around 20 and then when I was around 25 and now watching it at 34 I appreciate it more. It's a masterpiece from start to finish. There is not one bad thing about this film. The story and acting is amazing and the directing is top notch. What makes this film a masterpiece is it's the of the first movies of its kind and after this it changed movie making. I would agree it's one of the best films ever made.
7 December 2016,RedNERVE,1,1,9,Stunning Film!,"Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino is simple a one of the best classics out there. This crime/drama is absolutely terrific. The camera work is stunning, being a more modern movie. The acting was also superb.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson absolutely rocked every scene they were in. Both names are big in Hollywood so it is expected that they steal the scenes they are in. The overall acting in this film truly blew me away, i was not expecting such a good performance out of this movie and I would recommend this movie to any of my friends as well as anyone who love classic crime movies."

Everything is excellent, but it's the script that elevates this movie to masterpiece status. No other movie is as quotable as this.If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favour and do so - today!"
13 August 1999,Susie-7,4,11,6,"Decent, but what's all the fuss about?","Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the ""story"" meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind."
26 August 2013,gizmouk-775-537704,37,89,1,Boring,"Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantino's stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of 'Dusk till Dawn'. 'True Romance' was good as well,though he didn't direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantino's poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquette's speech where she reveals she's a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films he's paid homage to (ripped off) such as 'Vanishing Point', 'Death rides a horse', 'the Baby Cart series', The original 'Inglorious Bastards' etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other people's work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly."
15 March 2020,baileycrawly,1,2,9,"""English Mother......, Do You Speak It?""","Of all the Tarantino movies, this is the one that gets quoted most often. It's also the one that has the most commonly seen film cover (at least in my experience). This film is a lot of fun, masterfully written and executed to absolute perfection by Quentin Tarantino. This, in my humble opinion, is a much better effort than his previous Reservoir Dogs.
This film is a perfect example of a good non-linear narration done right. It's not too difficult to mess up a movie whose storyline isn't told in chronological order, but Tarantino knows how to pull it off, how to make it entertaining and endlessly appealing from start to finish. There was never a dull moment in this movie.
To sum up Pulp Fiction, it would be fair to say that it is 154 minutes of pure cinematic magic."
8 April 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,2,7,6,"Cultural memes, nothing more.","This movie is just a parody of gangstar life or whatever, it's funny, memorable, and memed to death. Also the whole Suitcase concept is just retarded, I can't believe how much ridiculous theories it got."

21 August 2014,rajatdahiyax,1,2,10,"Clever and daring, this high-pitched film never falters!!!!!","Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies. Prizefighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realizes that he must give up his life of crime."

Far worse than any of the famously bad cult/monster movies of the 50's-60's. never could understand how anyone could ever have thought this movie had any redeeming qualities, much less actually liked by anyone. The movie is so bad, it prompted me to register with IMDb to add my vote. Wish I could vote a zero...as in the movie never should have been made. Could not imagine a greater waste of time or talent."

This movie does not deserve any rating at all. if IMDb group has something called best/top negative comment for a particular movie, then I request them to treat my comment as the top in that category, that means I want my comment to be top from the bottom Most of the time I watch movies, only after checking the comments on the IMDb website, having seen such a good rating I rented this movie. Believe me, not many times IMDb comments proves so wrong, this was the worst movie I have ever seen... aaaaahhhhhh...... wait a minute I could not even see the whole movie. All the time during the movie, I was thinking that, the good part is about to come, but how was that possible, good part would come only if there is any. I am so surprised why so many people have reviewed this movie as one of the best movie they have ever seen. Total, boring, violent and logic-less movie."
27 August 2006,charlie_cheswick,7,13,10,The best movie ever made by far.,"After being in the Sundance Film Festival with the violent and brutal film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back with one true awesome movie that had everything to be perfect. Pulp Fiction, considered to be one of the best movies ever made. In this violent movie there was very good acting, superb screenplay, great photography and of course, GREAT music. Everything a movie could ever need. Pulp Fiction won the Golden Palm at Cannes and the best original screenplay at the Academy Awards. For me, it has been the best movie ever made followed by Amores Perros. A film with very deep and strong content. Pulp Fiction is all about two hit men, their boss's pretty wife and a boxer. They get crossed while the movie advances, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to get together."

11 October 2006,moondog-8,6,20,4,"If you haven't been exposed to much, you may enjoy this film","I wonder what cops or people living in *really* rough neighborhoods would say about this movie? In working on documentaries, I've been on police patrols and have seen my share of domestic stabbings, cop shootings and drug busts, and to me this movie is some smart-*ss white boy's comic-book imagination of ""what it's like out there on the streets"". So, I can understand why students at state universities thought this was the coolest movie around when it came out.Also, if you haven't seen a lot of esoteric and quality cinema, Tarentino may seem like some sort of movie-making genius. But if you've seen movies like *Kiss Me Deadly* or practically anything by Godard, you'll see that QT cuts and pastes a lot. When Pulp Fiction enthusiasts start to debate their theories about why there was an inner light in the briefcase at the diner, I just have to say that it's just an image ripped off from a movie made well before they were born, called *Kiss Me Deadly*.If you've seen the seedier and dangerous side of life, the movie is lame. If you're a classic movie devotee, this movie is a rip-off. But if you haven't been exposed to much, you may enjoy this film."

17 October 2002,SILENCEikillyou,2,5,10,...that hasn't already been said...,"I think I agree with all the reviews that have come before me.  (Not the ridiculously negative).  Though, this movie does have it's good points (great points); and some that aren't so good - i.e. drug use, violence, blatant disregard for human life and the lack of hardly any morals (on the part of MOST characters).  I've got to say, though, I loved this movie (""love"" is a strong word, considering some of the content listed above). Nevertheless, everything about the way this movie was created was masterpiece material.  Bold and daring variation from mainstream plot.  A look at the ""normal"" aspect of the lives of hanous characters - i.e. what they did or dislike, what and how they like to smoke.  Their feelings on pop culture icons and the list goes on.  Personally, I find that viewpoint fascinating.What worked:  Particularly, the absence of pretense in the actors' projection of their characters; I found myself actually believing that John Travolta was a heroin-abusing, cold-blooded assassin.  Each actor made their character real; and that says a lot about Terantino, as well.  He knew what he wanted from these artists and drew it from them; even when they didn't necessarily endorse the character's behaviors.  PLUS, I think writer/director Terantino portrayed the opposite of mainstream opinion. Some would say that his story glorified or encouraged these criminal actions.  ON THE CONTRARY, I believe he showed that bad things are more likely to happen to people who don't have a good moral fiber.  And, sad though true, these characters are, in any case, a reality of sorts in the world, today.What didn't work:  Not so much that anything didn't work, but that the content was too dark.  AND only for the reason that this was my dad's kind of movie, and one kids could learn from.  Though, from the content neither will watch (well not my kids).  My dad likes crime dramas, but he comes from an era where movies criminals don't swear or not much, anyway.  On the same token, weren't ever portrayed using mind-altering substances.  Other than this, I think he would love this movie.  Maybe he'll just have to catch the edited for television version - ha ha ha.  For me, though, I liked it just fine.9/10 - Hell, I've gotta save a perfect score for that might have the same impact, but my kids could watch, too.  Maybe not possible.  Other than that, I loved this film.thank you"
25 February 2008,TheLoneBadger,13,26,4,The type of movie I would've loved when I was thirteen,"Some observations:1. Anytime your most admiring audience is comprised of 17-year-old males you know you're in trouble.2. Anytime the most common adjective used to describe your movie is ""cool"" you know you're in trouble.This is a silly, juvenile, vulgar movie. Tarantino should have had the courage to make a cheap, violent, trashy Hollywood-style movie and been proud of it. Instead, he made a cheap, violent, trashy, Hollywood-style movie and hid behind the ""irony"" façade. Works for 17-year-olds, doesn't work for the rest of us."

26 January 2016,troyputland,1,2,8,Tarantino strikes again with his 2nd film.,"Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's second film. Is it just as rich and mighty as Reservoir Dogs? Yes. This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes. Mentionable moments include Thurman and Travolta's dancing, Jackson's reciting of a passage from the bible, and Travolta's accident. Tarantino proves that his first attempt at filmmaking wasn't a lucky one."
20 April 2006,Tom_Salmon,8,16,10,Fantastic! 10/10,"Before I write about this movie, I'd just like to say that this would probably be my favourite movie of all time. The dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick.Pulp Fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. The events though, do not appear in chronological order. This makes the movie much more interesting. Tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. The first of the three stories starts off with Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). They are making a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). On their way to this hit Vincent tells Jules that about his upcoming job for Marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. His job is to take his wife, Mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). This story goes on to show us the time had between Mia and Vincent. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."" This is Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) version of Ezekiel 25:17. And it is this that he recites before he kills. But the rest of the story is about Mia and Vincent and their time together. The Second story, ""The Gold Watch"", is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis). It starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. All of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. After this reminisces, it comes to the present where Marsellus is paying Butch to throw the upcoming fight. I wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as I don't want to spoil anything. The third and final story, ""The Bonnie Situation"", clears up a few things. This chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. It also introduces Jim (Quentin Tarantino. Vincent and Jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. This is where the Wolf is called in. (Harvey Keitel). This last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense).An excellent movie. Again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a Tarantino movie. 10/10. Fantastic. Will be next to impossible to beat"
19 June 2014,kccatfish93,40,100,1,The worst Movie i've ever seen in my life.,"Absolutely no idea why this film is so popular. I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie i've ever watched. The acting wasn't bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesn't give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasn't because of the suspense, I couldn't keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isn't even in the ball park. There isn't the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity."
18 December 2015,i-fraher,3,6,10,Pulp Fictton review,"This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."

This movie is pieces of a few character's lifes which is full of dark comedy, crime and unexpected situations. Also the happenings are unfinished just like the movie's name ""pulp"" fiction, movie explains it at the beginning. I really enjoyed the movie and i think its one of the most iconic (with the dialogs, cinematography, characters, everything) and best movies ever."

                        ",cant describe in words!,"The movie pulp fiction is the best movie i have watched till now in my whole life.It it an all rounder as it includes extreme drug use,mild sexual content,mild humour & intense violence. I say that most of 18+ teens would certainly like.The movie, which was a surprise Grand Prize-winner at the last Cannes Film Festival, is shockingly violent, provocatively obscene and profane. It won't just offend some audiences; it will offend the living hell out of them. Tarantino intends to rile people up.After the boxer story plays out, we slide back in time to the previous day, when we learn why the hit men showed up in strange college-guy clothes. It's because after the first hit, they took one of their spies home with them. While gesturing dramatically with a gun, Travolta learns why the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at something you are not willing to destroy. The gun, as guns do, goes bang; the young man, as young men do when hit by bullets, goes ker-blooie. Thus follows a bizarre adventure in post-shooting hygiene, in which the two hit men, a suburban buddy (played by Tarantino himself) and an elegantly mysterious fixer (Harvey Keitel) deal with the problem of scrambled brains all over the upholstery."

15 August 2013,bacard100,4,6,10,Best Movie Ever!,"Must See!! Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a film-goer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hit-man. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the disappointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product"

It's not the worst, but definitely not even close to top 250 movies as far as I am concerned. There are far better, more emotional, with better story, and more teaching, and more positive movies. This looks like some random presence of mess, crime, drugs, lust, relationships, skills, and religion. Yeah, there is confidence in actors, but most in form of talk. Talk dominates, and no purpose in watching it. Most of it is boring. Unfinished, without purpose, too random events, that is how I would describe it. But does not even motivates me to even think what would happen, since even before that it was nothing happening mostly. Some random typical but negative twists of scenarios."
29 April 2005,evanston_dad,1,3,10,Where to Begin?,"What more is there to say about ""Pulp Fiction."" Released in 1994, the film was an adrenaline shot to the heart of the film industry. Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before. Whether you love ""Pulp Fiction"" or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on film-making moving forward into the 21st Century. While watching ""Pulp Fiction"" for the first time, I knew sitting there in the theatre that I was seeing something that would immediately influence movies forever, and it has. I won't bother to summarize the plot, since plot in this movie is only of incidental importance anyway. I won't bother to single out individual performances, since the performances are uniformly excellent. I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years. If you're one of the handful of people in the world who haven't yet seen this film, run out and see it now. I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.Grade: A"
2 October 2011,theinaniloquent,1,2,10,"""You won't know the facts until you've seen the fiction""","The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.Pulp Fiction is known for it's high praise, highly praised as one of the best movies of all time. Funny thing is: the movie is pointless and it has no message. This is where it all falls in place. The acting is top notch; everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy. The style was very familiar if you have seen Quentin's earlier work. I found this movie to be completely awesome, something missing from movies nowadays. Movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way. Pulp Fiction, though, has NO message and executes it nicely. It's fun, it's gritty, and it's just over-the-top greatness. This is what I wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish Pulp Fiction. These facts combine to the fact that Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films. It has no point; but the fact that is HAS no point puts it up there with the greatest. I had no expectations beforehand but afterword I had so much to praise. The entertainment, the humor, and the point. Lying before, YES it has a point. But it is too obscured to find out the real meaning. I love this movie, and I'm sure you will too. Don't walk in with expectations; it'll ruin the surprise. The surprise is the joy and fun you'll get with the film. Pulp Fiction includes great acting, great fun, and overall great entertainment. This is by far Quentin's best film... 10/10."

John Travolta , Sam L Jackson , Bruce Willis , Chris Walken , Ving Rhames all make use of their time on the screen . Its so difficult to pick out a story that i like the most and maybe because the dialogue is all top notch and with a sense of humour that will make you the light of any party if you brought it along with you .

Director Tarantino did a great job with this film, having all the right actors and doing a fantastic job with the film work of the film. Ever hear somebody quoting a movie, generally it is something from this one. Fans of the film can go quote after quote of this film and hearing it from them just makes you want to see it more. With the story and his style of directing, this movie did a very good job at portraying the art of contemporary films."

I thought it was cool and so on, but I didn't get the hype about it. Surely the storyline isn't that good?Well, then I watched it again. And again. And again. This is a masterpiece, not because of the storyline, but of those who make the storyline.This movie isn't about who's the hero, what you win in the end or the survivors of something. This movie is about people, people just like us.The characters couldn't have been better. In any other movie, if a boxers girlfriend started talking about that she wants to eat a pie, I couldn't care less. In this movie, you care. Yes, its great that Tarantino made a ""pulp fiction"" of the movie, but the strongest card is the characters.The acting is great, the music is good, the directing is super. This is the Movie with a big M.So, if you've only watched it once and don't get it, please watch it again. You wont be sorry."

""Pulp Fiction"" just have my attention for one thing... the character of Uma Thurman, that i think (please, don't blame me if i'm wrong) Tarantino adapt from Neil Jordan's ""The Crying Game"". But, this is not the Femme Fatale that we know in Neil Jordan's film. Uma Thurman represents a sexy lady. A lady with her black hair. A lady who want dance without stop. ""Pulp Fiction"", i think, is an adaptation of all the violence of situations. Situations that is around us all the time... of course, with a little of fiction there. I confess the film cant be a favorite for me... but i admit is good made film. But a little excessive for nothing.After all the film works and has good thrills.*Sorry for the mistakes... well,if there any"
11 October 1998,vortex-4,8,22,3,Unentertaining trash,"One of the few movies I have ever seen that made me feel soiled and pistol whipped.  Although the non-linear story line is indeed an interesting concept Tarantino becomes so absorbed in showing us society's underbelly he leaves us with a hopeless mess of a film.  The violence is a study in wretched excess, involving careless murders, drug use, kidnapping and rape. There isn't even a single character worth understanding or identifying with. I ended up hoping everyone, including Tarantino, would die at the end of this film.  Unfulfilling garbage."

12 February 2001,newsboyz,26,59,1,Sad Commentary on today's world,"It is very sad for me to see such an awful, immoral movie on any top list. Much less number 19.  This high rating shows how desensitized the world had made us.  That people would rave over a movie that shows a man raping another man, that uses the f-word 200 times in the first 10 minutes, that shows what is supposedly pieces of a man's head splatter in a car, and that shows people overdosing on drugs, is very, very disturbing, disheartening, and sickening.  There was no redeeming value to this movie.  It was awful and should not have been given a rating R, or, for that matter, have ever even been released to view.  I guess if you are morbid and over 30, they should have rented it to you, but no one under 30, and certainly no one under 21, should have been able to see this movie.  I was sixteen when I saw it, and I was appalled.  I was not impressed by the colorful display of language, drugs, sexual immorality, or violence in this movie.  They should have created a new rating for this movie, no one with any type of morals should see this movie, whatever letter that would be.  To see this movie, and see the high rating, shows me why there are so many murders every year... and why there are school shootings."

The casting is brilliant: Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and even Steve Buscemi makes a cameo as Buddy Holly.The writing is extraordinary the imagination, time, planning, blood, sweat and tears that must have gone into writing it left me speechless. The occasional""comedy"" moment in this film always lightens the mood after a violent disturbing scene. Samuel L Jackson & John Travolta go together so well in this I'm surprised Tarantino hasn't thought of making a separate film with these two starring.This film is by far the greatest film I've seen so far in my life and i can't see Tarantino ever beating it, or in fact any other director beating it! So to cap it all off if you haven't seen this film yet you must you haven't lived until you have!"
12 January 2008,paul2001sw-1,1,3,9,Cooler than the Fonz,"If you only know the work of Quentin Tarantino from the self-indulgent 'Kill Bill' films, you'd be surprised to see the sheer brilliance of his earlier efforts: the Shakespearian 'Reservoir Dogs', the underrated blaxploitation thriller 'Jackie Brown', and this film, made in between those other two and perhaps his finest work. Inventive, clever, funny and cool, 'Pulp Fiction' was one of the defining films of its decade, and over ten years later, it still feels fresh. Samul L. Jackson will forever be remembered as bible-quoting hit-man Jules; John Travolta revived his career as his sidekick Vicent, who always seems to be on the toilet at the key moments; and if this sounds like a crass sort of gag, in fact it is executed with the stylish slyness that characterises the whole film. The dialogue is often hilarious too, while the achronological story telling is perfectly judged, turning a collection of essentially separate tales into a single movie. It's not quite perfect; the scene in the basement has its moments, but also hints at the tendency to unadulterated excess that has come to typify the director's later work. Watch this film instead; and hope that one day, Tarantino will manage to make a another one like it."
3 July 2015,blakiepeterson,1,2,10,A Cinematic Wonder,"Quentin Tarantino is a modern cinematic master, but he isn't a Hitchcock, a Spielberg, or a Nolan. Those directors, wonderful as they are, took the normalcies left behind by their filmmaking ancestors and spiced them up, making the familiar suddenly indelible. Tarantino, on the other hand, has never made something familiar to the viewer. His films, though often paying homage to the greatest of the grind house and the sturdiest of the studio system, twist anything even resembling an expectation — maybe the plots of Tarantino's films have been portrayed in some way or another before, but don't bet that the dialogue, the actors, the dynamics that fill each scene will match anything you've come to know.""Pulp Fiction"" is his most widely adored film, the one where his notable violent tendencies are kept to a comic minimum, the one where his dialogue never rings offensive and his exchanges glow with the smooth wittiness of yesterday's fools. Situations don't play out with the professional easiness of a square that went to film school: everything feels as though it were washed and dried by a cinematic nut more fond of staying home Friday nights watching Pam Grier kick ass than going out on the town with slightly drunken friends. Even watching a bad movie was better than experiencing the mundanities of life, because bad movies, bad as they were, took them away from the troublesome thing called reality.And so ""Pulp Fiction"" is a stew of cinematic wonders, some sexy, some funny, some tragic, some bloody — like the sordid comic books of the same name, there's unrelenting sleazy appeal to be found among the campy ruins. But the film is more than camp: it's radical noir, thunderously romanticized, delirious in its aesthetical violence. Tarantino doesn't just film his actors, his scenes: he falls in love with them, clinging on to their every move, making even the smallest of a detail, of a character, seem enormous in their connection to the overall buoyant picture. Tiny intricacies, such as the way John Travolta casually corrects Uma Thurman when she refers to all the waitresses at Jack Rabbit Slim's as Marilyn (one is Monroe, yes, but the others are actually schlockily dressed like Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield), says much about Tarantino's filmmaking personality. As much as he loves the icons and movies the general public refers to as masterpieces, he can't help himself from putting the underdogs on a pedestal and letting them shine, even if it's for a blink — because ""Pulp Fiction"" is directed by a cinephile who appreciates everything about cinema, not just the conventional Oscar nymphos. There's something about the film that still seems as dangerous as it did in 1994 — there has always been daring auteurs in the slippery slopes of Hollywood, but exciting is the way that Tarantino pushed, and continues to push, boundaries, making madness seem mainstream, luminous.Stories intertwine in a fashion reminiscent of 1956's ""The Killing"", time hopping yet staggering in its ability to complete each other's sentences. ""Pulp Fiction"" follows an assortment of characters, all connected: assassins Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), powerful gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife, the chic, cocaine addicted Mia (Uma Thurman), washed up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and bank robbers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). How they are associated I cannot say (it would ruin the genius of Tarantino's screenplay). But each character, so well drawn and so flawlessly portrayed (the actors are excellent, their characterizations already iconic in some shape or form), is unforgettable.Look at the way Vincent covers up his lack of smarts with his ability to go from agreeable to brutal in a matter of seconds; how Jules can enjoy the taste of a hamburger while ready to commit a hit because he's too damn used to killing; how Mia can make the mere smoking of a cigarette bolster the same sexy power of Ava Gardner or Louise Brooks; how Butch is willing to risk he and his girlfriend's (Maria de Medeiros) life for a watch passed (with disturbing fervor, I might add) on through generations; how Honey Bunny and Pumpkin don't think about the risks of robbing a restaurant because life is short and sin is fun.Even the most despicable of characters participate in conversation so complex and blackly hilarious we can hardly help but side with them. Tarantino doesn't just write characters; he lives vicariously through them, as if he kept them locked inside his mind until it became time to write the screenplay. Among the finest scripts ever written, startling is how confident every line is, how well the performers deliver each sentence. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a near perfect film, and though I prefer ""Kill Bill"", one can hardly deny the genius of Tarantino. How many directors create worlds as simultaneously grimy, cool, dangerous, humorous, appealing, as he does? If you can name five others, I'll have to take your word for it and revoke mine."

28 December 2012,DustinRahksi,1,2,10,The best of the best.,"This film is phenomenal, easily top 5 or even the best film of all time. It is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film, but when I watch this movie I feel happy, I listen to every word, and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening. It is shocking that this film only won one Oscar, very frustrating to even think about it, but most people seem to agree this is much better than Forrest Gump, I feel myself hating that movie for these reasons. Samuel l. Jackson should have won an Oscar, his performance is incredible, I hang on every word he says, he also has a lot of memorable lines. The characters in this film act so well together, that it doesn't even seem like their acting, but are instead meaning it. The soundtrack couldn't have been any better, it is perfect. Tarantino's talent is displayed in full view here, at the top of his abilities. This film is not serious, it is more relaxed and entertaining, but done so well you take it seriously, if that makes sense. I rarely have strong feelings for most films, but this film is different than most films, different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines. This film is tied with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for the best film of all time. No film will ever be like Pulp Fiction ever again, unless they copy it, that says a lot. I'd recommend this film to anyone, everybody needs to see this film, it is the best of Tarantino's masterpieces. I can't believe people cry about this films success, 1 star ratings by people that can't handle this film."
15 February 2010,willie_j_rudd,4,7,10,Dialogue filled masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. The films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive.The cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from Bruce Willis' street smart Butch to Uma Thurman's Mia who has a taste for nose candy. The two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with Jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving Uma Thurman's character from an overdose. Jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable.The camera work by Tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and Mexican standoff. Also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. The masterful film making and acting in Pulp Fiction makes it my favorite film of all time."

4 January 2012,usedtobeamovieguy,6,10,10,Room 416 prior to entering the apartment to Matthew 4:16,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."
17 May 2008,lagriff05,1,2,10,This will make you believe in God again,"WARNING: EXCESSIVE FANBOY REVIEWBrilliance comes in many shapes and forms. This is Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, widely and rightfully hailed as a masterpiece by several people, and I happen to be amongst them. Whoever they are, they have good taste.It's tough to say what is so great about this, because there's practically a grocery list of things to choose from. Its idiosyncrasies are bold and pronounced, yet weaved perfectly into a story that is both funny and charming, never becoming stale and never missing a beat. The repertoire of actors on display here is certainly of a high pedigree (Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, etc.), and the way the stories are mixed and matched and jumbled up into the movie's steely exterior is done so masterfully that you don't even notice, blowing Crash and Memento (two films which I also lauded heavily, by the way) out of the water. Everything is perfectly in sync with the other stories and the way they come together is done so well that it gives me fits.I'd have to write a much longer review to detail every reason why this is so good, but that's unnecessary, and I'll keep it short: Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and as the credits roll, either your perception of films (and sometimes life in general) will have changed, or you will be lost forever. Absolutely essential."
28 August 2006,famfrit,4,7,10,Wow. What a movie.,"Now, what can I say about ""Pulp Fiction""? You've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. I won't delve into all the details in this review so the best I can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it. A noticeable quality about ""Pulp Fiction"" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. The dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in France, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. Whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction"" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(You'll see what I mean) and in this way, Tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story. In an interview Quentin Tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? How right he is. Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. With the 5 different mini-""stories"" in the film(Jules and Vincent, Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the Bonnie Situation, the Diner, and the Golden Watch) Tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be cliché situations. The result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. And not only that, Tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless. At this point, I must address the complaints of many people who think that ""Pulp Fiction"" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. On the contrary, ""Pulp Fiction"" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through ""immoral"" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). Think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! Of course, there's nothing wrong with a good Disney movie for family fun and moral values, but Tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community. Not to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. There is nothing more I can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it. ""You won't know the facts until you know the fiction""."
9 May 2018,dkaznelson,6,12,9,It sucks!!,"This movie is ass and doesn't deserve the critical acclaim that the other reviews is giving it. I thought Vin Diesel really sucked as that boxer sucked, and i thought they should have used The Rock instead. Also it was a huge stepdown from the other Travolta classics. This movie definitely should not be watched by anyone in the future."
7 September 2016,eddie_baggins,1,3,10,Over 20 years on but Pulp Fiction remains a joy,"For a film that's not about much or anything in particular at all, it's incredible just how much of a mark the at the time largely unknown Quentin Tarantino's film has made on the industry with line upon line of memorable and endlessly quotable dialogue, it's perfectly pitched dark humour and a collection of characters that've made their way into popular culture from bible quoting hit-man right through to a leather clad gimp.Pulp Fiction is well and truly a one of a kind movie, a film born out of the imagination of Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary that could never be imitated or matched no matter how many times the imitators would try (and there have been many) and as time continues to ever so surely tick on from its original 1994 release that would see the film not only win the Canne's Film Festival's Palme d'Or but be nominated for 7 Academy Awards in which it won Tarantino his first ever Oscar (for Best Original Screenplay), it's a testament to the everlasting value of the film that it continues to be such a joy to watch these 22 years later.The 154 minute film still wizzes by on the back of its unending supply of quick witted jokes and bizarre circumstances, while its eclectic group of characters who sometimes run across each other's paths for better or worse are well and truly as fun as they could've ever been, whether they be likable or not. Pulp Fiction really did once and for all set in concreate the talents of Tarantino as the writer and director of actors, as his venture to the sun bleached streets of LA resurrected and redefined a number of careers with its success.It's been well spoken about for a number of years at just how important Pulp Fiction was to the at the time stagnating careers of John Travolta (who got to dance his way back into stardom), Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis but Tarantino showcased his chops as a leader of talent by injecting this wild tale with memorable turns (however brief) from the likes of Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and even Christopher Walken. It's a star-studded cast no doubt, but Tarantino handles each one of them perfectly and they show unbridled happiness getting to deliver his and Avary's home run hitting script right out of the park.As a movie fan you've likely seen Pulp Fiction numerous times (I know I have) and there's very little that could be said in an argument against its joys as a cinematic trip like no other. A film joy ride you'll be taking for years to come, Pulp Fiction is deserving of its classic regard and spot on many a film fans top 10 lists. Not too bad at all for a film with nothing but an endlessly mysterious briefcase tying it all together.5 bare feet out of 5"
21 April 2020,ali_hamoud,2,4,10,"OMG, really unsettling.",This is a masterpiece. It is brilliantly written and really every chapter is perfect and it made me really on the edge of my seat. One of the greatest movies in the world.
21 April 2022,mbrcf,1,2,10,Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece,"Years ago it was a cool thing to love and worship Pulp Fiction, it was cool to talk about it with friends, to quote from its characters, to perform those dance moves at parties and to even dress like Jules and Vincent. Nowadays, things have got somewhat a spin to them. It's not cool anymore to rate Pulp Fiction as one of your favorites, but these days the cool attitude is not to like this film, to dismiss it as a petty entertainment and to call it devoid of any artistic values.But, to me at least, trends don't matter. What matters is quality, greatness and influence a certain film comprises and when I think of Pulp Fiction, I think of a timeless masterpiece and a sacred haven for cinema lovers. This film has one of the best (if not the best, period) usages of unconventional/non-linear narrative that works so mind-blowingly well and adds a lot to the overall experience. All of the actors are fantastic but the dialogues and witty lines between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta are truly peerless.It certainly doesn't hurt this film's reputation when considering the fact that Guy Ritchie's entire filmography exists because of it, or countless other witty crime features that came after, only hoping to achieve some of what Pulp Fiction took home. To summarize, this film is so good that even its own director Quentin Tarantino had not been able to make another on nearly as good as this chef-d'ouvre."
12 March 2012,billcr12,1,3,8,Mind blowing,"So Quentin Tarantino brought John Travolta back from the dead with his casting in Pulp Fiction. Along with Samuel Jackson's Bible spouting psychopath, this is a stroke of genius. Pulp is a wild wild ride from start to finish. The story is not traditional in any way. Jules(Jackson) and Vincent(Travolta) are paid assassins hired by a gangster to deliver a briefcase with something of value which is never identified. The proceed on a bloody killing spree done in Tarantino's usual comic book style. Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman and my personal favorite, Harvey Keitel as a ""cleaner"" who I will not describe; just watch Q. T.'s great adventure, for he is a master at work."
14 April 2008,GOWBTW,1,3,10,Hardcore action and adventure!,"Quentin Taratino really outdid himself with this movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly hardcore, has plenty of action and truly got meaning in these intertwined stories. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play mob hit men Vincent and Jules. Jules is a Bible Thumper, while Vincent is just unsure about anything. Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace, a fun-loving, drug-using babe who wants to have fun. She and Vincent go to a restaurant win a twist contest, would OD on dope, and gets pumped in the heart with adrenaline to revive her. Her husband is ruthless mob boss, Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis plays boxer Butch Coolidge, who crossed paths with Wallace, fights him to a pawn shop both he and Wallace ended up fair game when the owner and his brother Zed(Peter Greene) are sodomites. The Gimp scene is a classic. Tries to warn the others about Butch's escape, he lets the gimp have it. Butch would get a katana sword, go stealth on the brothers, sees Marsellus get violated by Zed, kills the owner, and stalls Zed while Marsellus seeks revenge by saying, ""Step Aside, Butch"". Butch may got even with the owner, but Zed is Marsellus' business now. Vincent and Jules are seemingly unstoppable when the roommate failed to kill them off. They let him have it! It was a pity when Vincent's gun blew away the young man's head off in the car. And the diner scene, classic. Real in-your-face action is in this movie. Watch it! 5 stars!"

                        ","a larger-than-life blend of violence, humor, and chaos that belongs in a class by itself","Outrageously stylish, outlandishly profane, audaciously violent crime noir about killers, drug dealers, and every other lowlife inhabiting L.A.'s notorious gangland. The focus is on several overlapping stories spotlighting an array of distinguishable characters including Jackson and Travolta as a pair of hired gunmen who get much more than they bargained for, Willis as a crooked boxer who gets in over his head, Rhames as a powerful, authoritative crime lord, Thurman as his sexy, free-spirited, drug-addicted wife. Tarantino's graphic and uncompromising display of violence and crime will be off-putting for squeamish viewers, but it's done with such daring skill, such joyous amusement, and such flamboyant authenticity that it's likely to leave you in boisterous amazement. Filled with droll vocabulary, memorable one-liners, spirited performances from all those involved, and wildly innovative plot twists, this one of a kind film doesn't hold anything back. A direct hit! ****"

18 June 1999,Coxer99,1,3,9,Pulp Fiction,"Like Welles with Citizen Kane, director and co-writer Tarantino has crafted greatness in story, plot, character and filming technique with this fascinating and well awarded film that not only brought John Travolta back from a long slew of turkeys (Need I mention them?) but also welcomed the re-emergence of a style of storytelling and filmmaking made popular by directors like Cassevettes, Fuller and Sayles. The story moves perfectly and has loads of fun along the way, unleashing performances from Jackson, Keitel and Roth that are outstanding and worthy of study by film scholars, directors and actors. One of the finest made in the past ten years or even ten years from now."
10 February 2010,joshi_3592,1,2,10,A powerful and intriguing movie.,"What can I say, Quentin Tarantino changed something in movies. And this and Resoirvor Dogs was the one's that put him on the map. Now I must say this is a harsh movie, it shows stuff that's rarely shown in films, it is also realistic, and heck even funny at times. This is a good definition of a good film. It's well made, it's well written, and it's provocative. It's not the kind of film you turn on on a Saturday night for some fun, but if you like film, you must watch this. But I warn you, it's R rated for a reason. I guess the expression ""can you handle the real world?"" really makes sense in this movie. So if your a film buff and you haven't seen this, what are you waiting for? I give this film a 10/10."
27 May 2004,jazzest,1,2,7,Pop Art Cinema to Encapsulate the 90s,"Having extreme close-ups of objects such as a hamburger and a syringe (they are particularly reminiscent of James Rosenquist's paintings), quoting from numerous historic flicks, and referring to subculture icons in a humorous manner (most notably, Travolta wearing the T-shirt of UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs), Pulp Fiction is a film version of American Pop Art, visually, technically, and conceptually. Retrospectively, it is a bit odd that it didn't take place earlier than the 90s; probably the narrative film is a relatively conservative art form and had to wait until the sampling concept became popular in the other field, i.e., music. Along with other ingredients, such as jocularly detailed dialogues and a non-linear plot, Quentin Tarantino has established one of the biggest trends in the mainstream American cinema in the 90s. The impression that the film now starts belonging to the past tells how much impact it has had on the particular era; it represents, summarizes, and encapsulates the 90s in the same way Easy Rider does for the 60s."
13 May 2018,maisiemautterer,4,7,10,Greatest film of all time,"Pulp Fiction is ridiculously cool. Filled with cool characters and cool dialogue, it is truly epic and lives up to its reputation. I have never seen a film anything like this, with no consistent plot and no one objective, it is easy to view this film as a messy one, but I would say the opposite. It is a film that contradicts all the norms of Hollywood, and focuses solely on intricate and detailed moments of characters. We don't get back story, we don't get explanations. All we get is scene after seen of pure entertainment, excitement and comedy. Tarantino is an absolute genius to have created this, it is a film that you can never tire of. All of the actors give outstanding performances, even Tim Roth and Christopher Walken who barely appear, but manage to make a mark. Samuel l Jackson is so good as Jules and so funny, and Uma Thurman is mesmerising. I can see why this won best original screenplay, as the dialogue is absolutely spot on! This film has a profound spot in cinema history, a place truly deserved!"
17 January 2006,rufname-familienname,4,7,9,Simply a masterpiece,"There may be numerous brilliant movies made in the 90ies (e.g. Heat, Terminator 2, The Shawshank Redemption, just to name a few), but this one isn't only the best of the decade but potentially the best movie ever made - and by far the one I was most fascinated from the very beginning. Containing a bunch of great Hollywood actors, one of the best sound tracks around and arguably the greatest dialogues such a movie could offer (e.g. the foot massage talk, Willis in the cab, all of Keitel's lines) this Tarantino work is simply a masterpiece. The cast is extraordinary, without exception. Pick Walken as the vet, Tarantino as the worried yet clarified husband (nearly unbelievable if you consider him playing the perverse, violent Richard Gecko two years later), Willis as the lucky boxer and so on. I can't help myself - reflecting about the movie just makes me adore it even more (if that's possible). Probably I just haven't seen it often enough to somehow satisfy me yearn for Pulp Fiction."
10 September 1999,JAM-36,18,55,1,A film which celebrates brutality while supposedly parodying it.,"The acclaim for Pulp Fiction shows just how ethically sick many of us in this culture have become. This movie makes a joke out of murder, torture, and shooting heroin. Tarantino isn't making fun of these people or even the pulp fiction genre--he's celebrating them. He gets off on all of this and he hopes we will too. If it's hip to think that this celebration of evil is cool, then I want to be as unhip as possible. Being a teacher of modern German and Russian history, you might say I'm not inclined to see physical brutality as entertainment. And I frankly don't give a rat's a** for the opinion of all those clowns who gush over how tremendous this garbage is. ""Best movie of the '90s, hands down?"" What a crock."
10 November 2011,andrew-32-51147,7,16,4,"This film was suave, cool and kitschy... but so what?","I was very underwhelmed by this film. I thought thought that the performances, while excellent given the flimsy material, were so unfounded in depth of character which made me think ""ok, why should i care whether he dies? or whether she dies? or whether he cant pay back the gangsters?"" I found the interwoven stories to be a nice idea however the sheer length of each story for approximately 15-20 minute intervals made me lose any interest i had with the previous characters. To this end the film became this consistently unfunny, boring, benign experience to which there was no reason to care about the characters, the plot or the subtext, and the ending while clever was very longwinded with no beneficial or worthy climax.3 stars given for 1) John Travoltas performance 2) occasionally witty lines/conversations 3) the opening scene in the diner"
19 July 2019,perwiraganesha-79496,5,8,10,"A Masterfully Written movie, with a Fresh Take on the Gangster Genre","As usual Tarantino shows us again and again, what a good writing could achieve in a movie. With countless of seamless dialogues that flows like a river. And story arcs that intertwined with each other, the audience will be swept away in a heartbeat by just listening to those writings. Even a blind man can watch Pulp Fiction."

I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It literally took me a week to watch this movie. I would watch for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time & then have to turn it off. My friend at work would tell me to keep watching it & I finally did. This movie is full of senseless violence, torture, rape scenes, horrible dancing & stupid dialog. The only thing it doesn't have is a cohesive story line. Watch at your own risk.

Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's best, but I still think Reservoir Dogs is a much better movie. But what I do like, is the fact that Tarantino always uses the same actors. They're all great! Think about it: Harvey Keitel (who played mr. White in Reservoir Dogs) , Uma Thurman (Batman & Robin), Ving Rhames (Mission:Impossible), Tim Roth (also Reservoir Dogs) ,... I just think it's fantastic! Go on and make many other movies like that, Quentin!!!"

Nevertheless, the acting was outstanding (excellent cast!) and the charming style of Tarantino is unmistakable. I'd recommend a watch."
9 May 2008,axismladen,1,2,10,Excellent,"At the very beginning of writing my comment on this movie i must mention that's it's a perfect movie which will be remembered for a long,long time.Usually i like Quentin Tarantino very much.I think he has that line that makes him stand out from the other director's.Something like Kubrick had.You know,his own style of film making.In Pulp Fiction there is no main character.Everyone is the main character in his own story.And the story of those people come together at one point of the movie.The decision of one character influenced on the life of another character.And so it goes from one to another.This movie is directed great,acted great-especially by Samuel L. Jackson,shooted great and the most importantly written great.I was on a drink with my friend the other day and he said that he think's that Tarantino suck's.I told him that he's stupid and i asked him why he think's that.He said that Kill Bill is a piece of overrated crap.I said OK,that's your opinion but what do you think about Pulp Fiction or Reservoir dog's.He said he didn't watch them.I mean how can someone say that Tarantino suck's only because he watched one of his movies which is probably his worst movie.I'm not saying that Kill Bill suck's i'm just saying that it suck's when it's compared to this one.Anyway i own all the Tarantino's film's so i borrowed him Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dog's.The day or two after he returned me the movies and he said that he liked them both but that he think's that Reservoir dog's is a better one.I wont comment on that because it might be true.They are equal in my opinion.To come back to the subject you don't have to like Pulp Fiction.But you can't say that it's a piece of crap just as you can't say that Tarantino is a shitty director.His movies have style and he has style as a director.Period.Another thing i want to say is that he is the first one that started with making these kind of screenplay's.The movie start's with an ending than it comes to the middle and than at the end we see the beginning.Or something like that.Anyway,his way of writing influenced many film maker's and screenwriter's today.I'm not saying that they copy him i'm just saying that he had influence on them just as John Woo or Ringo Lam had influenced him.But that doesn't mean's he copies them.To short the comment i think this movie is a masterpiece that deserves the reputation it has.I think it will alway's be remembered and watched.It brought so much in the new period of film making,from dialog to story that it can't be called a bad movie.A must see film.Anyone who likes movies and who think's he know's something about movies has to see this film!!!!!!!"
25 February 2020,EVON1TY,1,2,8,A good Tarantino movie. But it is not a bit cheap for a great movie.,"This movie has good film editing and a really good storyline. This movie is really good but not a cult movie or a great movie. Everything is just clear. It has amazing style to tell the story. But the contents in the movies are really cheap.It has some awkward scenes. They are cleaning the car in 30 minutes. Okey it brings realistic style but the whole movie is already realistic, no need to waste 30 minutes."
17 October 2003,bhcpc,4,11,6,Good but overrated,"Tarrantino did what he set out to do in Pulp Fiction - making a wacky, nonlinear piece of entertainment full of gratuitously over-the-top dialogue (or monologue) and violence. He made that clear even in the title; it's just a highly charged but disposable fiction. He succeeded quite nicely.
However, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place"
11 September 2012,Hawkensian,1,2,9,"Pulp Fiction has accrued legendary status in well under two decades, and it's easy to see why.","'Pulp Fiction' is a film with few flaws particularly worth mentioning. Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is. The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino and Avary's complex script. This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' very re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is. 'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hit men who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an ageing but courageous prize fighter; Marsellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner. The characters' stories famously clash with each other, regularly to chaotic and hilarious effect. Tarantino is yet to return to this kind of form. After 'Jackie Brown' in 1998, he spent time making the entertaining but comparably meagre 'Kill Bill' films, which were well orchestrated viscera, but ultimately below him. He then made 'Death Proof', which was an offensively bad, juvenile piece of work with a script of unprecedented annoyance. However, Tarantino made a comeback with 'Inglourious Basterds', which had a rather appealing premise and many memorable scenes. 2013 sees the launch of 'Django Unchained', which, with its ensemble cast and inevitable flair, is one of the most exciting films of the year. 'Pulp Fiction' has all the components of a classic, it has the scope and the quality, it is within the bracket of films such as 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas' and 'Citizen Kane', films that will be revisited by audiences forever, films that are firmly considered as 'required viewing'."
19 June 2002,stevetseitz,1,2,7,A clever and non-linear approach to questionable subject matter,"It definitely has it's moments, but in the end it isn't a movie that demands multiple viewings. It's not subtle and isn't very realistic. It's still a trip down the rabbit hole to see Tarantino's mind on display, but why is he in all his movies? The excessive language actually takes more from the film than it adds upon subsequent viewings. The movie is good, but by no means worthy of it's high ranking in the ""IMDB top 250"". It was very trendy for a time to LOVE this film and many non-film fans thought they were being ""hip"" for jumping on the bandwagon. Has it done anything to advance the art of cinema?"
25 January 2002,Howlin Wolf,1,3,10,Screams 'Style!' all the way...,"... Let's clear one thing up first: I happen to believe that this movie is not as good as ""Reservoir Dogs"". ""RD"" had a clearly defined story and aim. I'm not so sure this does. It feels more like an exercise by Mr Tarantino, demonstrating just how audacious he can be. Is there anything wrong with such flashiness when the result is this entertaining? Not in the slightest.""The Gold Watch"" segment did nothing for me, and in my opinion should have been left out of the final cut, much as I like Christopher Walken. The rest of the movie without exception is a tour de force of controlled direction (Tarantino always knows where the film is going, even if his audience doesn't) understated but powerful acting, and moments of bizarre humour. I could quote the dialogue verbatim here, but there is simply too much quality and not enough space.This was also Sam Jackson's breakout role. For that we should be thankful, because the man is 'star quality' personified...No amount of superlatives can come close to encapsulating the feeling that most of you will get when watching the movie for the first time. It is an absorbing experience, almost like you have stepped into a much cooler VR sim of real life. Repeated viewings do not seem to dull its stark vitality.Those of you who abhor it for its casual attitude to violence miss out on its good points that DO NOT contain violence; namely, realistic yet captivating dialogue, flawless character development and bravura directing. It is much more than the glorification of gangsters and their subculture, a la ""Lock, Stock... "" and its ilk.Calling it the best movie ever made is hollow and unsubstantiated praise that I will not garner it with. One thing that can not be denied is that from its arrival it changed our perceptions of what cinema can mean to all people.Despite this, as I said, I don't think it can compare equally with ""Reservoir Dogs""..."
26 August 2009,sme_no_densetsu,1,3,9,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.""","Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that needs no introduction. One of the best films of the nineties, it made Tarantino ubiquitous and landed an impressive seven Oscar nominations.The film is comprised of three related stories. One story involves hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) & Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) as they pay a visit to some 'business partners' of their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Another story revolves around Vincent Vega once again as he is instructed to take the boss's wife (Uma Thurman) out on the town while he's away. The remaining story focuses on an aging boxer (Bruce Willis) whom Wallace has bribed to throw his next fight.As you can see by the names mentioned above, the cast is chock full of talented individuals. Travolta, Jackson & Thurman all got awards recognition, though none of them were lucky on Oscar night. In my opinion, Jackson in particular should have won an Oscar for what is arguably the best performance of his career. The rest of the cast includes the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel & Christopher Walken. Definitely an enviable cast.The film's sole Oscar win was for the original screenplay, which is arguably the film's strongest point. The script is loaded with memorable dialogue, the plot is original and the film manages to elevate itself above other crime films by mixing violence & redemption. It is not hyperbole when this screenplay is ranked among the very best of all time.As for Tarantino's direction, that's superbly handled as well. The film looks great and it also sounds great. The soundtrack is exceptional, including standout tracks by Dick Dale (""Misirlou""), Kool & the Gang (""Jungle Boogie""), Urge Overkill (""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon"") and Chuck Berry (""You Never Can Tell""), among others.All in all, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a top-notch film whose high stature is unquestionably warranted. Needless to say, if you've never seen this movie you owe it to yourself to do so post-haste."

1 March 2012,oneguyrambling,1,3,10,I think QT is over-rated nowadays - but def not here.,"Pulp Fiction is rightfully renowned as a landmark in modern film. Even when it was released in 1994 you just knew you were watching something that was changing the rules somehow.In essence the film was a series of delicious conversations between well crafted and memorable characters, punctuated by casual profanity, racist epithets and extremely adult topics, all set against an immaculately selected soundtrack of essential yet often obscure tracks selected from several decades. In between all this there were a few scenes of eye-opening violence and/or grown up situations.Rather than go into detail discussing what Pulp Fiction was about I have decided to talk more about what it made. And I am not referring to box office or DVD salesPulp Fiction:  made me wonder what the band aid was for.  made me and millions of others wonder what was in the case  made Jackrabbit Slim's, Big Kahuna Burger and Red Apple cigarettes household (fake) names.  made exploded penises the new severed ear.  made an Urge Overkill cover 'that OD song' and worse still  made The Rebels the unfortunate soundtrack to interracial male rape.Furthermore, it;  made Bruce Willis and John Travolta legit Hollywood Stars again.  (made me like John Travolta for 2 and a half hours!)  made Frank Whaley, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette momentarily cool.  made Ving Rhames the coolest bad guy in years, Uma the coolest gangster's moll and Samuel L. Jackson the coolest MF *period* in 1994.  made Tim Roth, Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel lose zero cool points.  made dated hairstyles like Vince's ponytail, Mia's bob and Jules' 'Soul Glo' perm somehow acceptable.  made non-racists casually racists – at least when quoting dialogue from this film. ('Dead N***** storage', ""N***** please, that's all you had to say"", 'And he'll be damned if some g***'s gonna get his greasy yellow hands on his Father's watch').  made someone saying ""Bring out the gimp"" less confusing than it might have been in 1993.  made 2 ½ hours seem like not enough for once.  made me buy the movie poster, the VHS, the 10 year anniversary DVD, the 15 year anniversary DVD when the 10 year was stolen, and in all likelihood the blu-ray at some point in the future.And finally;  made a young buck named Tarantino the king of the world and master of the cinema universe. A title that he unfortunately swallowed too readily, leading to pap like Death Proof and over-rated dross like Inglourious Basterds. Dross that is inexplicably fawned over by a movie-going community somehow blinded by credits in the bank.Final Rating – 10 / 10. That last point aside, Pulp Fiction is indisputably a work of true greatness, rich, luxurious and rewarding of repeat viewing. It is what real filmmakers should aspire to.."

Amanda Plumber, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and the supporting cast bring a cheap paper back novel to life on the silver screen.The segments with Trovolta and Thurman in the 1950's motif restaurant, and Jackson, Travolta, Plummer and Roth in the coffee shop are 'just' unforgettable.If you love cinema, this is a must see. Be forewarned, however, that the film is graphic and Tarantino uses a device sometimes seen in literature and less often in cinema, namely, and non linear and disjointed timeline (his trademark). Just go with the flow and enjoy one of the best cheap novels that you've never read."
3 December 2005,garykbell,172,411,1,The worst movie I've ever seen,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
26 September 2010,classicalsteve,1,3,10,Masterpiece of Non-Linear Filmmaking Centering on Darker Subculture,"Toward the beginning of the film, Bruce Willis' face appears inside the sleaziest of bars in the San Fernando Valley. But instead of the self-confident and wise-cracking characters he played in ""Moonlighting"" and ""Die Hard"", he dons a very different mask. We notice Willis is not speaking but listening. Listening to a voice of authority, played by a lesser-known actor, Ving Rhames as some kind of underworld kingpin. And then we understand. Willis is listening to a superior. Willis nods and speaks very little; he is subservient to this voice, and the Willis we have come to know is no longer Willis but a pawn in a much larger game in which he does not wield much power. This is one of my favorite scenes with Willis, showing his range as an actor and being able to descend from higher stardom into the lower depths of humility. We learn that Willis is being paid off for some kind of act. The envelope containing the payoff money is presented by the kingpin, whose face is yet unseen. Just as he is about to hand the goods over, he immediately jerks it back. Willis does not try to grab the payment but sits patiently waiting for the superior to hand him the goods. Willis knows he cannot have the payment until the superior is ready and willing to give it to him. The gesture is a symbolic reminder of who is really in power, and it's not Willis. Willis' humble scene captures well the flavor of the entire film called ""Pulp Fiction"", a masterpiece of sub-culture drama but definitely not for all tastes. Characters and story are all spontaneous. These people live on the edge on the darker periphery of American reality. Instead of going to football matches, they kill people in sporting events. Instead of having drinks at the Hilton, they overdose on intense psychedelics. And if they aren't careful, they may end up either on the business end of some hit man's .45 or in a remote dungeon where people are into S & M. This is certainly not for those whose favorite movie is ""the Sound of Music"" and their favorite music is sung by Doris Day.Samuel Jackson and John Travolta play two hit men in service to the kingpin underworld lord. But they never discuss their missions. Instead they banter about all kinds of irrelevant subjects, like the names for American burgers on the menu in Paris. This chit-chat is a breath of fresh air, and probably a lot more realistic, than other films in which characters are discussing ""the plot"" ad infinitum. The hit men's stories intersect with another plot line involving Bruce Willis, a boxer who is on the take from the same underworld lord to throw a fight. But these are just the bare bones. Throughout the film, the hit men, the boxer and the kingpin weave an intricate tapestry of plots and subplots told in a non-linear style.Part of the beauty of Pulp Fiction that ranks it one of the most innovative of films is that it collates as a movie puzzle. Events occur out of sequence rather than told in a straight linear fashion. Scenes happen in the middle of the film that are the end of the story. The first and last scenes of the whole film, which are in my opinion the best, are the middle of the story, not the end. And yet the events of the last half of the first scene are not shown until the very end which turns out to be the last scene of the movie, but not the last scene of the story. Prior to Pulp Fiction, I don't know if there existed any American movies daring enough to pull such cinematic misdirection and make it work. Some European filmmakers may have done this, but rarely such an innovative structure has occurred in American feature films. And yet, Tarantino makes it work, and you understand by film's end how all the pieces fit together. The collation is similar to Tarantino's first production, Reservoir Dogs, but he takes those innovations to the next degree.Because of the subject matter, not everyone will be able to enjoy Pulp Fiction. But I think that's a mark of a great film, which is ironically what Hollywood studio executives try to avoid. Hollywood wants everyone to like a film, not just some people. But the price paid for this curtailing to everyone's tastes is a marked lack of visionary works. Luckily, someone saw the value of ""Pulp Fiction"" and gave it the funding to allow it to happen. The result is one of the most tantalizing of cinematic experiences but not the kind of movie you'll give your grandmother."
25 May 2009,I_Love_Spielberg,1,2,10,My favorite Tarantino movie!,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a Quentin Tarantino-directed film about a series of stories, involving two gangsters, a boxer, and a gangster's wife, and how their stories inter-mangle with each other. This is by far Tarantino's masterpiece. Now, I've heard rumors that his next film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is suppose to be his masterpiece, but I don't know. I would say ""Pulp Fiction"" is his masterpiece. The writing is magnificent. I found myself laughing tremendously from the dialog, which is great because I enjoy clever writing. The acting was magnificent. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman were awesome in the movie. Everybody else was awesome as well. But you have to see it for yourself because I can't describe its awesomeness here. However, I have to say this: The n-word is used excessively in this movie, so if you're offended by the use of this word, then this isn't the movie for you. If not, then you shouldn't mind."
25 August 2002,mattymatt4ever,1,3,9,"A brilliantly original, unforgettable film!","I just bought the ""Pulp Fiction"" Collector's Edition DVD boxed set, and I was glad I did.  Not only does it include this great movie, but it also contains an interview with Quentin Tarantino on the ""Charlie Rose"" show, an interview with him and Michael Moore at the Independent Spirit Awards and even a Trivia Track.  It would've been way cool if it included director's or actors' commentary, but I still felt it was worth my money--especially since I got it for a good price at $19.99.Anyways, back to the movie.  This is an inspired, truly original work of art that doesn't appear like the traditional work of art.  This can be considered an art film, but it's not an art film that bores you with pretention after pretention and has almost no momentum to keep it going. This film has plenty of momentum.  Even at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I had trouble hitting the ""Pause"" button.First of all, the cast is topnotch.  As many know, this is the film that re-launched John Travolta's career.  And that's great, being that he's one hell of an actor, and this is one of his best performances--the ultra-cool Vincent Vega.  Ironically enough, he was only paid about 10,000 dollars (give or take) for this movie, being that it was shot on a modest budget--though it rarely shows.  And now he's a multi-millionaire.  I think Travolta owes more than a ""thank you"" to Mr. Tarantino.  Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific as the ultra-hip Jules Winnfield.  He has some of the best lines, which I will get to later.  Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, showing that as well as a great movie star he's also a terrific actor.  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though I wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. Harvey Keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance.  Ving Rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil Marscellus Wallace. Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette have some funny moments as Travolta's drug-dealing buddies.  And Uma Thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting Mia Wallace.
My favorite element of this movie?  (And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) The dialogue, of course!  ""Pulp Fiction"" has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history.  Tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""True Romance"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""  After watching this movie twice (since purachasing the DVD), there are some lines I simply cannot shake out my head.  These are some of my favorite quotes:""My name is Pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t.""""Does he look like a b**ch?  I said, 'Does he look like a b**ch!'""(After the cab driver asks Butch--Bruce Willis--what his name means) ""This is America.  Our names don't mean s**t.""""Pulp Fiction"" is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action.  It's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget.  OK, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. I personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of ""PF.""  Whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms.  In a short while, I've fell in love with Tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing/directorial style.  Others can't quite handle it.  I still don't understand the whole violence issue.  In the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene.  Most of the violence here is left to the imagination. Well, I guess people have a strong imagination.My only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the Bruce Willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background.  But I still consider this a great movie, and one I'm proud to include in my DVD collection.  I can't wait 'til the Special Edition of ""Reservoir Dogs"" comes out this week, so can buy it and the ""Jackie Brown"" DVD to complete my Tarantino collection.  And is the soundtrack great or what!  I actually bought the soundtrack before I bought the movie, and I fell in love with the music just as much.  It includes such greats as Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Jungle Boogie.""  And who can forget that great ""Pulp Fiction"" theme?  It was interesting to find out that the song wasn't composed specifically for this movie, and that it did actually exist beforehand.My score:  9 (out of 10)"
8 June 1999,Rumples,1,2,7,"Some good, some bad","Firstly I should say that I saw the sanitised for tv version - I don't watch 'R' rated movies and this was 'R' rated even here in Australia. This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with rather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10"

                        ",Dynamite,"Pulp Fiction is  a fun film that never takes itself too seriously and has one heck of a time telling its story.  Had it been straightforward, this story is as jumbled as Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", the movie would not have been as strong.  Since things are out of sync and trying to be hip, I will say this is a good movie whose only fault is the consistent 70s motif. Overall, 4.5 out of 5. ""Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face."""
6 April 2008,mario_c,1,3,10,Tarantino's masterpiece!,"PULP FICTION is a great film, but it's not just a ""commonly great"" film, it's a masterpiece! It's really a genius' work! It possibly was one of the first movies I ever saw with a non-linear plot, and at the time, probably 1995 or 96, I found it a bit strange and different but I liked it. Today, after all these years, I just don't find it different or peculiar, I find it brilliant, because now I can see so many details that probably, at that time, I didn't notice. In fact, there're so many ""little things"" in this movie, which I remembered no more, that are crucial to understand the real meaning and significance of the film. It is very sarcastic and full of dark humor, but it also is a very good social and moral critic to the occidental culture where we live Even if it seems, at first sight, just a movie about gangsters and the criminal world where they belong, it is not, because it shows us a large number of scenes where friendship, honor, forgiveness, mutual aid, and the good Human values are present. So, it has a very strong message, behind all that blood and those killings. I guess I didn't notice that the first time I saw it But this movie isn't just brilliant because of the excellent argument, the remarkable acting, its great message or the nice soundtrack. No, it has an amazing and unforgettable humor! The entire film is full of sarcastic moments and phrase lines which stay in your head for years! Who doesn't remember the ""foot massage"" conversation, the ""5 dollars milkshake"", the ""Royalle with cheese"", the quoting of the bible or the guy which kept a gold-watch up his ass for five years?! These are classic moments of the modern cinema, as the film itself! It's definitely a movie which changed something in cinema, and it is, for sure, a classic of the modern times!"
11 October 2002,Pedro_H,1,3,9,A classic of black and bloody humour,"In modern day LA a set of barely-connected gangsters, corrupt failures and their hangers-on go about their daily business.A film with a lot to answer for. Certainly it took director Quentin Tarantino from cult director to magazine cover star and created a raft of imitators. It put a few noughts on the pay cheque of Samuel L Jackson and brought John Travolta back from B movie hell.Like Star Wars it is difficult to know if you are reviewing the movie or the hype. This movie lived on word-of-mouth. They didn't need to hype it - it grew from a modest budget black comedy to being the movie that everyone was talking about.The title says it all ""Pulp Fiction."" That means those cheap novels that you read on airplanes or on the beach: full of characters that you know by heart, stories that you have heard before. This movie makes fun of a few of these characters.While this is a black comedy, the film world has been blacker, but it has never been funnier. I'd have never have thought that bringing a drug overdose back from the dead would make me laugh, but it does. A failed attempt at homicide make me laugh, but it does. I could on a while longer.And just when you are getting clever-clever and think you have it all figured out off the film shoots of in another direction. Amazing. This is a must see twice movie - there is so much little detail you miss first time around - things that make what happens later clearer.I am always worried about morals. Few movie viewers are. They are more worried about being entertained. Just look at bullying you see on the playground, not at the act, but the bystanders (male and female) laughing , joking and enjoying.Whether I like it or not Tarantino forces me to be one of these people - and there are times I don't like it. He is more restrained than in Reservoir Dogs (another great movie) but people are brought on to be carried out - if you see what I mean.There is only one scene that is totally without justification. The scene where Travolta drives while high on drugs - he should have been shown have at least had a near-accident. But he just cruises along without a problem.The thing I notice is that the film is slipping in the IMDb ratings. I know why. The film has become overblown and over discussed. This isn't To Kill A Mockingbird or Shindler's List with social history to support it past its initial afterglow.We have even seen a TV series - The Sopranos - that is just as good and which borrows a few of its tricks. I learned nothing new about my life (or how to live it) from watching Pulp - not even from repeat viewings - but it is a brilliant piece of cinema that cannot be ignored, just as long as you take it as simple entertainment and remember the title at all times."
24 November 2011,StevePulaski,1,4,10,Does it look like a film? Then why you try and review it like a film?,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art. It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is ""what's in the briefcase?"" that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a ""Royale With Cheese"" in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question ""what?"" again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, and Quentin Tarantino.

                        ",Razor-sharp dialog in violent and profane gangster parody. Highly recommended,"Pulp Fiction is without a doubt Quentin Tarantino's best work. The film is a long, violent parody of the gangster genre with some excellent performances. The dialog is very profane with countless F- words. It also sounds very geeky at times. However, its razor-sharp, slyly self-aware and frequently very funny. There are multiple story lines which intersect, and the screenplay won a richly deserved Oscar. Samuel L. Jackson is in tremendous form and has a memorable speech. Travolta, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all good. The film remains engrossing throughout and is highly recommended.Overall 10/10"
31 August 2002,NateW,1,2,9,A wild ride worth taking,"After many years of putting it off, I finally rented Pulp Fiction at the recommendation of several friends and watched it. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. It is truly one of the more original films out there, not to mention possibly the most influential film of the 90's. The all star cast, Trevolta and Jackson especially, delivers memorable performances and memorable lines while crossing paths in wild fashion. Pulp Fiction established Quentin Tarentino as a major force in Hollywood, and it still stands as his best work. Pulp Fiction, for many reasons, is indeed a wild ride worth taking. 9/10"
30 June 2013,Anuri46,1,1,10,My name is the Lord!,"It's the best movie I've ever seen.Pulp Fiction made my believe to the chance stronger.It really exists,I mean luck.The screenplay is wonderful,dialogs are interesting and the characters are understandable.Tarantino's made a miracle that will never be forgotten.Pulp Fiction's incredible dialogs and great acts and informal story,made me not to move until the end.Mr.Director and his movie changed my idea about all the movies I watched after that.There's a dialog throughout the movie from the Holy Bible:""And I will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""It may be about me.At first I suspected him and I wanted to poison and destroy his brothers!But he really did it!He revenged me and after he got finished I really felt damned and crushed.I thought Pulp Fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch it.But it actually cost. I'm sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of it.Or in better language,it was one of the first postmodern movies.Take it easy. How can your luck be bad?This movie has lots of bad chances.Your boss's wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknown.What will you do?You get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gun.Or you're talking to your friend and he's sitting at the car's behind seat.You look at him during the talk and your pistol's in your hand,suddenly your gun takes the shot by itself.You haven't shot the legs,hands,or even the chest;You've shot straight at your friend's head!And when you wake up,you've taken s--t in the car and it's full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the cops?There are many things like this.Well it's great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD."
27 October 1998,Keith-47,23,77,1,Horrid film,"There are only three movies which I have rented that I refused to watch from beginning to end.  One is Natural Born Killers, another is Blazing Saddles and the third is this piece of trash - Pulp Fiction.  Which of the three is worse, I can't say for sure.Suffice it to say, however, that anyone that has the stomach to sit through this jumbled, nonsensical, celloid wasteland of obscenity, violence, lasciviousness, drug abuse, immorality, and thuggery, ought to get a quick reality check before all is lost.If there is a hell, it is being forced to watch this movie over and over again.  Not only is it horrid to watch, but it makes not an ounce of sense."
13 June 1999,Tito-8,1,3,10,The best film ever?,"There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll give my opinion anyway.  Quite simply, this movie is magnificent, and possibly the best that I've ever seen.  This film is a seemingly endless series of unforgettable moments that make for an indescribably enjoyable movie-going experience.  EVERYTHING about this film is top-notch.  The Travolta-Jackson conversations are flat-out hilarious, the Uma Thurman sequence is the ultimate wild ride, and the Bruce Willis segment was as riveting and nerve-wracking as anything that I've ever seen.  I could go on and on for forever about this movie, and I almost feel sorry for those of you who still haven't seen this masterpiece."
14 May 2008,jdkraus,1,3,10,"Different, Intense, Violent, Funny, Philosophical, overall a Quentin Tarantino Picture!","People that I know call ""Pulp Fiction"" unique but one of the best movies ever made. I've only see two films by Quentin Tarantino, and they were both of the Kill Bills. I liked both movies as the ""popcorn loving"" action and dark comedy junkie that I am. So I expected something along that line for ""Pulp Fiction"". It is far from it.The best way I can describe this film is a non-chronological list of stories combined together with roller-coaster circumstances. Yes, there is some action. And yes, there is a lot of wicked humor. But what held my attention was the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino (who won the Oscar for it in 1994). Even more so, the all-star cast flourished it with some stunning performances. John Travolta shed a whole new light on his acting ability as the cynical hit man, Vincent Vegas. Bruce Willis as the boxer, Butch is in a sense a protagonist, but also a man determined to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, even if it means killing. Uma Thurman is simply marvelous as the amusing drug addict Mia. Also included is: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, and Harvey Keitel are all nice additions to the film.Of all the performances, I found Samuel L. Jackson's to be the best. I always remember Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus in Die Hard 3, but as Jules in Pulp Fiction, he is larger than life. He's cool and funny, but also philosophical and the only character that changes his values towards the end of the film. He was snubbed at the Oscars. I was so captivated by the film that I did not even bother to realize that the movie was over two and a half hours. I can't help but say this is a great film. It is not my favorite, but I will agree that this should stay on the top ten at IMDb's top 250. 10/10"
30 August 2014,sethmlanders,1,2,10,One of the Best Movies Ever Made in the History of Film!,"It's hard to put in words how much I love this movie, but here it goes. Pulp Fiction is an absolute masterpiece. A story that's told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if you've viewed it before. It's so amazing that it's nearly flawless!Where to begin, where to begin. The dialog is interesting yet realistic. Rather than giving us frequent exposition, which most filmmakers suffer from, Tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. The movie's time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence, it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. The direction is sure-handed and Tarantino isn't afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. The casting is first-rate, this is the movie that helped revive John Travolta's career and made the rest of the actors' reputable to the Hollywood system.For those who are concerned about the level of violence, it's actually not as graphic as it seems. Yes, it's intense but if you look closely, the content of it isn't gratuitous or repulsive. Gene Siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with Roger Ebert. For example, Bruce Willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. The victim is faced away from the camera so you don't see the weapon attack him. Then, when Willis stabs the sword into the guy's knee, it's out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction.Don't worry, I'm wrapping this up. If you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is, you are going to have a fun two hours. Hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burger!"

18 August 2007,bluemts,36,83,1,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is a mess of a movie. Gratuitously violent and indulgent. Everyone wants to talk about the humour of going over a bump and someone being shot. How hilarious is that (this comment is meant to be ironic. I note this for the Hollywood saturated brain-dead).To call it a classic requires calls for major surgery on the definition. The film is really just a sign of a sick culture. Stay away from it. The irony wasn't lost on me. The problem is that it was of the sledge-hammer variety.There are so many good films that I am at a loss to see why this is chosen for special consideration. And to make matters worse, the editor on this programme insists I use American spelling. Goodness, get a life. Program with ""me"" on the end of it was still English last time I looked."

19 April 2010,IrasMaldinista,4,7,10,Do You Know Tarantino? Get To Know The Master Here...,"This Movie is one of last century's biggest achievements. No exaggerating. To make a winning masterpiece, you have to be special. Is master Tarantino special? Tell me about it. People find themselves in Pulp Fiction and remain in awe of its stunning style, a work of art that wins in all areas. This is not my favorite movie ever, but I admit it's the most powerfully and creatively made among what I've seen.Not everybody will completely understand Pulp Fiction, Not that I claim I'm superior to many, no, the point is you have to know Tarantino to 1.enjoy and 2.figure out this movie quite well.The long and rich dialogue sequences, the unique close-ups, the usual tribute to the history of Cinema, the captivating violence and finally, the innovative style of the picture should be visible only to those who know the young phenomenon to an enough extent.The first time I saw it I was like, ""This must be great but I've not gotten the message"". The second time that happens to have happened a few minutes ago made me understand that THERE IS NO MESSAGE, a fact that per se was enough to convince me this one is a top-10 on my list.Tarantino is many young director-to-be's idol. He's got a gift, his works contain what many liked and seriously tried to insert in their films but couldn't. If Scorsese has one live rival to be able to compete with him, then it's none other than our man.Travolta and L.Jackson are in my opinion the best pair ever in the history of Cinema here and the supporting roles are acted to perfection. You can't imagine this movie without the presence of Thurman, Keitel or even cameos by the likes of Arquette and Z.Tarantino is a film lover/freak and you can sense it in each and every moment of his works, so make sure this title is the first one you'll watch after reading my review because I'm telling you, you'll love it."
1 August 2005,LoneWolfAndCub,1,3,10,Quentin's Greatest,"Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's second movie after Reservoir Dogs.This is his best. The cast is superb, the plot intriguing, the dialogue absolutely brilliant and characters well developed.The story is three mini stories that all in some way intertwine together. One is about Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), who are two hit men who work for Marcellus (Ving Rhames) and there misadventures.The other is about Vincent and Mia (Uma Thurman) who is Marcellus' wife. Vincent is told to take her out for a good time and of course, something goes wrong, involving one of the most well known scenes of all time.The last follows boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), who is on the run from Marcellus because he broke a deal.Other characters are Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her husband Pumpkin (Tim Roth) who are robbing a diner and there are guest appearances from Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken.This movie is an absolute pleasure to watch. It is funny, violent and thought provoking. It is a must see for fans of Quentin or just for movie buffs.This has taken a place in my top 5 all time movies and i'm sure will stay there. 5/5"
2 January 2008,ajstroe,73,183,1,Overrated C R A P,"Yes, that's right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time he's near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when he's asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because he's in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so ""Cool"" all the time.Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actor's like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn don't get born any more. Today it's just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if there's something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, you're a really ""cool"" bunch, drowning on dry land."

30 April 2008,LagerLagerLagerShouting,1,2,10,The Best Film Of The 90's.,"Quentin Tarantino's all knowing, self-referential, immensely entertaining slice of contemporary pop-culture is a brilliantly original work, full of various homages and subtle nods to a vast array of television shows and assorted movies. The ingenuous structure and style is the work of man obsessed with everything film related and his homages to classic directors such as Douglas Sirk and Jean-Luc Godard are interpliced with more contemporary nods to kung-fu, MTV and media savvy. The ingenious structure derives from the dialogue fuelled narrative, that is bristling with great one-liners and a contemporary hip style and bad ass attitude. Brilliant scene after brilliant scene is dragged out with long takes and tracking shots placing the escapist, media-friendly viewer in the thick of the action, with the overall feeling evoking that of a comic book. The great cast, wonderful characters and unchronilogical structure packed with twists and turns also promise to keep the viewer entertained through this brilliant piece of 90's cinema.10/10"

4 stories that connect together, this is not original or new; it was already done by Kubrick with ""The Killing"" back in 1956. Tarantino relies heavily in copying from other directors (Godard, Fellini, etc), though his dialogues are sometimes witty, funny and creative. I felt i was watching some dumb B-movie from the 1970s or 80s, only with a better cast and photography, and it seems to me that most of the audience is jumping to the ""hip"" wagon with this movie."
4 May 2002,superboy478,1,2,10,Enjoy and Don't Analyze!,"Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of all of time. The beauty about it was that in order to appreciate and understand it, all you had to do is enjoy it and not have to worry about analyzing it piece by piece like MULHOLLAND DRIVE.It was just creative the way Quintin Tarantino mixed up the plot, the after math, and the character's lives all in one movie like the way he did.There are three seperate story's to the movie that were split up scene by scene in this movie. Trust me, it is not confusing following the movie. It is a piece of cake.The first story is about a pair of hitmen named Vincent Vega (John Travolta) who is a selfish lowlife who does nothing but put down people, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a religious person who doesn't believe in killing but will if he is forced to or if he is mad enough. These hitmen are assigned to pick up a brief case at an appartment for their crime boss Marseluss Wallace (Ving Rhames) which turns out to be a success. However, it turns very bad because they take a hostage with them which ends up to the hostage accidently having his head gruesomly blown to bits. Jules and Vincent are forced to go to a man's house and call mob leader The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to take care of the situation. Their day turns into nothing but pure hell.The second story is where Vincent Vega is scheduled to take Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out on a date. To me, that part of the story was very interesting because there was so much action and chemistry between Mia and Vincent. It becomes heroic because after dinner, she O.D.'s and that forces Vincent to do something that is hardly seen in the movies.The third story is about a depressed boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) who apparently made a deal with Marsellus to lose a match in an upcoming boxing event. When Butch apparently kills the other fighter in the match that he was supposed to lose in, Butch and his european girlfriend Fabienne are forced to run. The big part of this part was that Butch accidently forgot his father's gold watch (Christopher Walken makes a funny and explicit monologue at the opening of this part) and forced to go back to his apartment to get it. He does get it but accidently runs into Marsellus. He and Marsellus are caught trying to kill each other and are taken hostage by two homosexual rapists who have a pet known as the ""Gimp.""The best thing about Pulp Fiction was the art, and the writing. To me, the script was just like the bible. Quintin wrote these characters lines that were spoken beautifully and with no apparent mistake, plus the actors were chosen perfectly. I couldn't have asked to see better actors than the ones Quintin chose. I honestly can say that Pulp Fiction has every single thing that every movie should have. I give it: **** out of ****."
24 January 2000,Libretio,2,10,4,"Interesting movie, but hardly a 'classic'","PULP FICTION Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby Stereo SRGreat dialogue counts for much in Quentin Tarantino's highly acclaimed PULP FICTION, but the film suffers at times from a surfeit of unnecessary chatter. None of the main characters are particularly likable, but Tarantino's script is eventful and forthright, and he manages to juggle the disparate elements of humor and horror with consummate ease. Harvey Keitel steals the film in a cameo appearance that doesn't actually require him to *do* very much, but he does it beautifully anyway; Maria de Medeiros is sweetness itself in another cameo as Bruce Willis' girlfriend; and Samuel L. Jackson dominates the screen in a disturbing sequence where he and John Travolta confront some thieving young punks (led by Frank Whaley) in a run-down apartment. Best scene: a 'hilarious' gunshot decapitation and its grisly aftermath."

                        ",A landmark Disney movie. You read that right.,"Not so well known fact: this was the highest grossing live-action Disney movie of 1994. It hauled in over $200 million worldwide, and the only other mouse house film to compel more people to sit in a dark box that year was The Lion King. I'd argue that Pulp's release is among the most pivotal moments in Disney's century-long history, and certainly one of its most overlooked.In some ways, this single film paved the way for Disney's immense buying spree throughout the last quarter century and its explosion into becoming the largest entertainment company in the world. Pulp's artistic and cultural impact has been well litigated, but its influence on emboldening a new approach to growth at Disney is effectively forgotten.This is the very first Miramax movie greenlit under Disney ownership after they bought the studio for $60 million in 1993. And its box office likely paid for the entire acquisition all by itself. Since this was the first time Disney had ever acquired another studio, without Pulp's sparkplug success there's a chance their future string of additions like ABC, ESPN, A&E, Lifetime, History, Freeform, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Searchlight and Hulu might have never occurred as forcefully as it did. In retrospect, it's arguable that this one movie was the opening salvo in what became a $100 billion+ acquisition spree.As Disney structurally held Miramax at a significant distance, Harvey Weinstein turned it into his own devastatingly predatory, financially reckless fiefdom. It obviously became an extremely troubled purchase, and they parted ways with him in 2005, selling off the studio entirely in 2010. While they now haven't owned Pulp for over a decade, it did technically originate as a Disney movie and remained one for 15+ years. That Disney largely ignores the Miramax era is an inevitability of the nature of a publicly traded media behemoth. However, in a stroke of quiet irony, Disney-controlled Hulu released Untouchable - a notable documentary about the brave women who endured Harvey's trail of radioactive waste - in 2019.As a result of Disney effectively writing Miramax out of their corporate narrative, Pulp Fiction's role in the company's modern history has essentially evaporated. It likely provided early proof-of-concept to them that acquisitions can work, paving the way for the ""Disney"" we know today. There's a fairly direct line from Pulp Fiction in 1994 to Avengers: Endgame 25 years later. Both were critical and commercial triumphs of their genres, and each were stewarded by Disney's aggressive post-Walt growth ambitions. Some act like the company's record-shattering, acquisition-driven 2019 box office came out of nowhere, but I think the early seeds of it were being planted at Jack Rabbit Slim's 25 years earlier. That Disney no longer owns this movie but now owns The Seven Year Itch, a film paid homage to in that infamous restaurant, is a quiet encapsulation of what a central role Disney has played in stewarding popular culture past and present.Outside of its commercial success and unique place in entertainment history, the watershed release of Pulp Fiction simply remains a quietly singular moment in Disney's increasingly labyrinthine history. That they were creaking out middling Don Knotts movies not that long before this as the company stumbled toward being nearly smashed into oblivion by corporate raiders is a whiplash-inducing gear shift in retrospect. For better or worse, in 1994 the little mouse began to roar, and it wasn't just because of a lion cub."
17 June 2002,chrisbrown6453,1,3,9,"Pulp Fiction; it's big, flashy, nasty, violent and tremendous fun.","I'm not sure that it's at all socially redeeming, but a rousing good time can be had by virtually everyone. Pulp is certainly easier to take than Natural Born Killers, which was also big, flashy, nasty and violent. It has more heart, though some may find it excessive, profane, misogynistic and/or racist. Whatever you think, Pulp Fiction won't bore you. It is an intricately structured work that employs a very large cast. Working on a big canvas, Tarantino's weaving of plot lines and numerous characters has a subtlety reminiscent of Robert Altman, though he has a bluntness that Joel Silver would envy. At a long 149 minutes, it all moves along quite nicely, though sometimes the author (Tarantino) seems to enjoying nothing more than hearing himself talk. The marvelous cast has a field day with Tarantino's ramblings, and there are many standouts. Christopher Walken has only one scene, but it is a showstopper. The Timex was hidden where? John Travolta, as a hit man who can dance a wicked twist, does his best work. Samuel L. Jackson, with a curly Mod Squad hairdo, is outstanding as Travolta's partner in crime. Harvey Keitel has a brief but funny cameo as a ""cleaner."" Mr. Clean specializes in ultramessy (bloody) situations that need a professional touch. Even Bruce Willis is great as Butch, a thick-skulled boxer on the run for not taking a prearranged fall. See it."
3 February 2021,TheCorniestLemur,1,3,10,"Yes, it is a masterpiece, okay?","So it was me and my girlfriend's anniversary yesterday, and I put some effort into cooking (which we're both bloody awful at) and we agreed that this meant that I got to subject her to one of my favorite films (she doesn't watch films all that often).And somehow, it wasn't until about halfway through that I realised that I had now transitioned into the evolutionary phase of the biggest film bro imaginable.Luckily she enjoyed it too.And if you're on this website, I probably don't have to tell you at all why I love it. It's Pulp Fiction. Yeah, it has something of a reputation for being an r/movies film for insufferable plebs who think they're a lot smarter than they are because they can tell you the chronological order of the film, or an r/niceguys film for people who say that they would have saved Mia by ""giving her what she clearly wanted, wink wink"".However, it is genuinely really, really clever. The structure of the narrative is unconventional, but it most definitely has a purpose for being that way, and the fact that every single character, no matter how minor they are, is so memorable not necessarily because of things they do, but because their dialogue is just that good, is something I'm not sure I can say about for any other film I've seen.And that pretty much covers the complaints I've heard from people who don't like it, so now I can say that the casting and acting is simply perfect, Tarantino's directing is excellent, it's rewatchable to no end even with a runtime of two and a half hours, it's utterly hilarious if you're not one of the aforementioned plebs who take it so unnecessarily seriously, the soundtrack always fits amazingly, and those bloody characters make up one of my favourite ensembles ever in a film.Like I said earlier...it's Pulp Fiction. You know why I love it, you know why so many other people love it, and if you haven't seen it, then...what are you doing, man? As cliche as it's become to say all this...you really do just have to watch it, because it wasn't a coincidence that this film is as beloved as it is."
24 November 1999,bobbyelliott,1,2,6,A movie of our times,"Pulp Fiction is a movie of our times - fast moving, exciting but gratuitous and ultimately meaningless. This movie has pace! It moves along from the opening scene at great speed and it's never anything less than thrilling. There are stories within stories throughout the movie. Several funny moments. And many violent scenes. And that's my problem with this film. It seems to glorify (or at least casualise) violence. A kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair. But it's all very entertaining - just a bit immoral and it doesn't really have anything to say except that Tarrentino has a fascination for meaningless violence. Entertainment value is 9/10. But I gave it 8."
21 October 2019,GiraffeDoor,1,4,5,Nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.,"This smug little kaleidoscope of low lives had a lot of potential.But like a lot of its writer's works has aged horribly as it can no longer corner the market on movies with a zany style and now must viewed in terms of its substance, not just its style.The meandering nature of the narrative really has no narrative: there is no intrigue or sense of development. It's not an anthology movie but it almost is and therefor each scene can only really be enjoyed as a thing in itself without context and so lacks both the ground work and the sense of consequence that would make them classics.It's sort of sad to watch it desperately just try to produce iconic or quotable moment after moment rather than apply itself to something a real back bone. It's sort of enjoyable for its sheer bombasticity but it gets old really quickly with no characters I want to root for which would be fine if only there was some sense of pay off on any of the character's fates.Some people jack themselves off to this movie's freshness but I think this is another case of something that was fresh for its time ageing horribly and its enduring cult status is a mixture of nostalgia, emperor's new clothes and people not willing to look behind the make up to see what a pandering little flick this really is.It has its moments but it never seems to aspire to more than a sequence of moments rather than a movie in the familiar sense. You could argue its a meditation of fate and consequence but that just sound a nicer way of saying it wasn't thought through well.It's not just tedious for long stretches, it kind of annoys me."
21 September 2019,EvanKevelson,1,3,10,Regardless of story line the writing and dialogue are genius,"This is Tarantino's true first born. Everyone who saw this movie felt compelled to see Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown..regardless of your opinion. Just as Taxi Driver & Raging Bull made people watch Mean Streets Unlike Tarantino, personally I'm not blindly devoted to Scorsese and won't say Taxi Driver and Mean Streats we're over my head..I believe they helped get to Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and Wolf.
Sequencing and Narrative films(Narrative was mainstreamed by Scorsese with Ray Liota, Pecci & DeNiro in Casino & DeCaprio in Wolf). Tarantino uses Narrative in Both Kill Bill films and I'm the Hateful 8.
The other influence adjusted for audiences with a shorter attention Span was Leone..in terms of using Ennio Marricone..(John Williams has nothing on him)..and the pre-violence filming e.g. Uma's 1:1 Face Offs, the emergence of the Bear Jew to bash in the Nazi sergeants brains in etc..
I write this because I am surprised that the Biggest Goof is not mentioned anywhere and I'm surprised it took me so long to see it because it's so Glaring perhaps.
When the story line goes back to ""Bonnie's House and Vincent tell Jules to chill him out, one can clearly see the ""miracle bullet holes"" in the Wall behind Jules before the other kid comes in 5 feet away with the arm cannon and ""Shoots off 5 rounds that missed"" leading to their ""Metaphysical Discussion about Divine Intervention"""
22 February 2008,emperor_bender,1,3,10,Just when I thought Tarantino's reign of great movie-making had ended...,"...BOOM! This movie came out. This one almost ties with Reservoir Dogs in how great it is. The stories were very well made. They were well thought out, and put together in a way which even had me saying ""What the hell"" at times. I like that. The characters were excellent. John Travolta was great as Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson played great as the god-fearing Jules Winnfield. Bruse Willis could not have done better as the quick-thinking boxer Butch Coolidge. Ving Rhames surprised me with a great performance as the gang-leader Marsellus Wallace. Uma Thurman was actually not bad as Marsellus' wife, Mia Wallace. Harvey Keitel was AWESOME as the cool, laid-back, problem solver Winston Wolfe. Tim Roth gave a great performance as the British robber ""Pumpkin""/Ringo, and Amanda Plummer as his lover ""Honey Bunny""/Yolanda. Eric Stoltz managed to show his true acting skills as the drug-dealer Lance. Even Tarantino was great as the angry Jimmie. There was not a single actor I would replace in this movie, nor a single scene that should have been cut. If you want an action/crime/thriller movie with a great storyline, ""Pulp Fiction"" is for you. 10/10."

So much has been written about this movie and so many people like it that it is hardly worth adding my two cents.  I found the sick humor to be a little over-the-top for me and although this is a cleaver movie with some fine performances, I find a good deal of it to be both obnoxious and gimmicky.  Perhaps, only the Matrix is as over-rated as this film.  Interesting movie which I would recommend to anyone who likes off-beat movies.  I vastly prefer Resevoir Dogs and Desperado.  I might add that this was an incredibly influential film and it still influences how films are being made today.  The list of ""film noir"" movies that were influenced by Pulp Fiction are almost too numerous to mention.  One of these was THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU ARE DEAD which I liked better than its' predecessor.  Being very original, PULP FICTION was seen as a ""breath of fresh air"".

11 November 2003,Didier-Becu,1,3,9,PULP FICTION (DIDIER BECU),"Quentin is often accused of stealing ideas from lost B-movies but what the hell??? If only all directors would have his freshness. Better than Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs or even Jackie Brown??? I really am not interested in the answer as after all Tarantino hasn't a huge list but they all changed the landscape of current filmography. Just like no one other Tarantino makes ""lost actors"" arise...or tell us how you can explain that Tarantino makes a superb actor out of Travolta? The dialogues are genius as well and it are the kind of movies you watch over and over, some scenes like the one in where Willis is in the hand of some sadistic gay is genius. Too violent? It would have been more violent!!! I hate statements but if there is one than it's Quentin belonging to the cream of the crop!!!"
4 January 2005,HardKnockLife210,1,2,9,Entertainment At Its Best,"Quentin Tarantino is a name with which many are familiar, especially if you call yourself a movie buff. However, Tarantino seems to be one of those directors, whose material you either love or hate. For the most part, I think I'd put myself in the ""hate"" category. Neither volume of Kill Bill really appealed to me, and I haven't bothered to see any of Tarantino's other films. Any other than Pulp Fiction, that is, a film which I definitely did not hate.Pulp Fiction's three greatest strengths are the characters, the stories, and the direction. Each character possesses a life of its own and each actor propels that character onto the screen in such a dazzling and eccentric way that you can't help but enjoy the action on screen. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, actors you would expect to see in a brainless action flick, all put in good performances. Sure, there's no powerful drama, but the interesting stories are the focus here. Each character fits his or her story, and the entertainment increases as the stories intertwine energetically thanks to Tarantino's direction. Also, unlike Kill Bill, the focus of Pulp Fiction is not mindless action, but the brilliant stories and characters themselves.Now, on to Tarantino's famous Pulp Fiction screenplay. Let me begin by saying that, for the most part, the dialogue is as interesting as the characters and the stories, providing insight into their lives. However, as with any movie that attempts to infuse comedy, it's hit-and-miss. There are several more hits than misses, but some of the dialogue in the film is so absurd, that it can't help but detract from the rest of the film.Therefore, if you're looking for a deep, profound film, then I can't really recommend to you Pulp Fiction, as, in my opinion, it's just a popcorn flick. Yet this is a smart, even brilliant, popcorn flick, and I dare you not to be entertained.Final Grade: A."
29 July 2018,thomasjay-2201,1,3,9,Classic,"Long, granted but worth every second. A display of Tarantino's quality as a director and storyteller each segment is compelling and entertaining and even tense but all add up to the bigger picture and show how great the director truly can be when creating his worlds. A great mix of style and substance I highly reccomend this film"
23 December 2015,cheesywombat,1,1,8,The ultimate 90's classic!,"Tarantino, you genius! If you loved Reservoir Dogs, prepare to have a new favourite film! Quentin Tarantino blows us all away once again with 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" with Oscar nominees Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Despite the scenes being in a mixed up time order, this is one every college student should have in their DVD collection. There are some scenes in which you can't help but laugh, even though a serious point in the film. I won't name any right now, because this is a SPOILER FREE REVIEW, PEOPLE! COME ON! But anyway, Pulp Fiction is sure to have you dying for more! The only thing I have wrong with this movie is Jules' Bible passage, which (despite being FRICKING BRILLIANT) does not appear in the Bible. But that doesn't matter, it's a brilliant film!"
12 July 2020,hoffman-burk,2,4,7,I'm not the general consensus,"For me, Pulp Fiction is a good movie. It's just not as good as so many say it is. When I took film classes in college, everyone wanted to be the next Quinton Tarantino. I actually thought Pulp Fiction had some brilliant scenes, but also some rather dull and boring scenes that were a struggle to get through. I've seen the movie now four or five times over the last twenty years to see if my opinion changes. It doesn't. In my opinion, it's a very overrated movie. It doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's a must for any film buff, but the hype is a little over done."
24 July 2003,elu5iv3,1,2,7,"Good, but not as good as the hype...","Pulp Fiction: 7/10This is #18 in the top 250 on IMDB. With some big actors like Travolta, Jackson, and Willis, it doesn't lack namepower. I enjoyed this consistently, but it didn't blow me away, so I can't call it one of the best ever. I'm also not a fan of Tarantino's out-of-chronology approach, which messes things up a bit (like a character dying in one scene, then appearing in the next). The acting was strong besides an awful performance by Tarantino himself in a guest appearance, the script just didn't hit me. It had some great moments though. The ""big three"" of the movie (those names above) were really good, Willis in particular, who showed that he can really act when he isn't just blowing things up. Good movie, just not anything memorable for me."
30 January 2006,movie_nazi,4,9,10,Absolutely Flawless,"Every once in a while a film is released that changes the face of cinema forever. Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is one, ""The Godfather"" is another and of course there is ""Pulp Fiction"". What can you say about a film that 14 years later is often imitated but never quite duplicated? From inventive camera angles, non-linear story-telling, and snazzy dialogue, all of which are perfect examples of the film's attributes that are often attempted to be replicated but with little or no success. Today its cast members are all known stars in their own right but at the time were relative unknowns or were in a considerable rut in their careers. It was this film that made it where they pretty much can name their own ticket, and have.When people ask me, ""What is is about 'Pulp Fiction' that you like?"" I have to answer, ""It is better to to tell you what I don't like about it because the answer is shorter, and that answer is 'nothing' "". Why? Because the film is absolutely flawless. Intriguing, unassuming, characters that makes the experience all the more authentic. This coupled with a perfect script and polished acting make this perhaps the most entertaining crime drama of the 90's or of all time. It is just one of the jewels that make up the cinematic releases of, in my opinion, one of the greatest decades for movies up to date. Granted, ""Pulp Fiction"" is not for everyone but if you have a strong stomach and have a scrupulous officiousness towards the criminal underworld then this film is a must see."

The performances are nearly flawless, Jackson, Travolta, Stolz, Thurman, Roth, Keitel, too. The music is also great. The movie is very hard to describe and is not for everyone. This is one of the best films to come out in my lifetime and is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. Truly, a must see!"
22 October 2002,loonie,40,96,1,This is one big piece of over estimated CRAP!,I just managed to stay awake through this load of crappy excuse for a motion picture! It only contains a enormous amount of words that don´t say anything. The two main characters are so stupid that they should never have been created. And when Bruce Willis disappears from the movie it is so totally dead. This is a total waste of time. And so is commenting on this junk so I will stop now.
28 January 2005,mjw2305,1,4,10,Still the best Tarantino Movie to date,"This movie was recommended to me by my Sister about a year after its release, it was the first Tarantino movie i had seen, and i have to be honest, it nearly passed me by. You know when you sit down to watch a movie and your minds somewhere else, well that was me the first time, and i could have missed out on a gem.Such was the recommendation from my sister, i actually went and hired it again, i don't think i pieced it all together properly on this viewing either, but i certainly recognised its quality, and quickly added it to my collection, and later bought it again on DVD.The Direction can only be described as masterful, the cast is simply perfect and each piece of the intertwining story was brilliantly written and played out. What else can be said, that hasn't been said before.10/10 Recommended to anyone who likes Tarantino, and to those who don't know his work, start with Kill Bill 1 & 2, then watch this. (This is better but Kill Bill is easier viewing)"

                        ",The best thing to come out of a million grindhouse exploitation films besides entertainment!,"The plot is a little more complicated than usual. The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994. It holds up perfectly and it's a must-see if you haven't seen it yet."

                        ",Op-Ed,"I don't know how many reviews of Pulp Fiction are on the IMDb website, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth. If you have the time or patience, go to my review of Mean Streets, Scorcese's classic hood drama from 1973. If Mean Streets made me feel icky, Tarentino's Pulp Fiction made me feel almost feverishly sick to my stomach. PF gave me cramps as I sat squirming through the buckets of blood, the sick humor, and all the talented and elegant film-making expended to bring forth this profoundly ugly movie.I'm not religious, but Pulp Fiction and its director's predecessor, Reservoir Dogs are almost . . . evil. I don't use that word lightly, nor do I feel particularly spiritual when I see movies, but this thing and its creator feel bad, just wrong.The best movie I have ever seen is Roman Polanski's Chinatown (Polanski isn't exactly a poster boy for virtue considering his notorious legal problems) and even though the bad guys win in Chinatown, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is a virtuous man. Virtue defeated is still virtuous. Quentin Tarantino has created more than one film where there simply is no virtue (although Samuel L. Jackson's character makes an attempt toward the end of Pulp Fiction, the soul of the movie is a darkened husk by then).Pulp Fiction is a cheerless, hateful thing that finds humor in human beings accidentally losing their lives. When I saw it, I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. When it was through, I was depressed, sad for the vermin on the screen and off.I've written that I like movies with grit and depth; my wife likes to be entertained. If you've never seen Pulp Fiction (or if you have and want to see it again), take my advice and rent something old and Disney.Or even Chinatown. At least there's somebody to root for."
1 May 2002,ufo0001,1,2,10,Brilliant,"Pros: Memorable scenes, memorable characters, humor, score.Cons: At times too violent, a lot of swear words used.Critics were split in 1994 deciding what was the best picture that year. Mordern classics such as the Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show, Forrest Gump, and Pulp fiction marked thier debut. The best, according to the Academy Awards was Gump but the true masterpeice that year was Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was  genre defying as is influenced other movies and filmakers notably Paul Thomas Anderson and Guy Ritchie though they haven't been able to top Quentin Tarantino's Brillian film. The best ""story"" will have to be the one following Bruce Willis as a boxer who does anything to get back his watch. We know the watch is important as there is a rather lenghty and funny narrative of how the watch comes to the hand of Willis. Other memorable characters are portrayed by Samuel Jackson, Quentin Tarantino, Uma thurman and John Travolta.Premise: Four stories joined over a period of two days featuring druggies, cleaners, mobsters, boxers and a few other shady characters.Pulp fiction was nominated for seven academy awards and won only one for screen writing. Won the Palm'D or at the cannes film festival.Grade: 10/10 (Tarantino's best)"
20 February 2020,v-56289,1,3,10,A masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is a legendary movie. Ever since I saw it for the first time, I fell in love with it.. The music completes the perfection!"
25 July 2003,Silverzero,1,3,6,"Funky, hyper kinetic, ultra-cool satire on crime.","Often deemed as one of, if not the, best movie of the 1990's, Quentin Tarantino's deliberately humorous and violent satire on the sleazy underworld of Los Angeles certainly lives up to the hype. Often, similarly themed gangster movies can be slow in pace and boring in parts, but `Pulp Fiction' is delivered in such a slick, stylised manner that you won't notice the two and a half-hour running time pass by. The Oscar winning script is top-notch and brilliantly conceived. It's the jumping forward and back in time that makes the film work. Only at the end of the film do you realise in what order the events took place. And the interweaving and overlapping comes in the form of three vignettes. They used the term `series' of vignettes so that it would sound like more than three. It would have been smarter had it one or two more episodes, but as it is, all works quite well. The first is arguably the best. What makes this one work is the close attention to detail and memorable scenes that occur. The second story, `The Gold Watch' is also quite good. This is shuffled in second when it's actually how the film closes.
And the third vignette, `The Bonnie Situation' is probably the funniest of the three. Also thrown in there is the café robbery involving `Pumpkin' and `Honeybunny'. The actors are given tremendous material to work with, but the huge ensemble cast is perfectly chosen and is probably the best since `Magnolia'. The lead star, John Travolta (Oscar nominated for his part), is always perfectly believable and brilliantly styled as hit man Vincent. But the performance isn't developed enough to consider above support. Samuel L. Jackson excellently portrays his counterpart, bible-bashing hit man Jules. Also lurking in there is Uma Thurman's exceptional delivery as the enigmatic, sassy femme fatale. Surprising is the fact that Bruce Willis got the most screen time yet received the coveted `and' credit.
Along with this, there is plenty of star-power from a supporting cast that would make Robert Altman weep. Harvey Keitel, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth round up the cast and all give ideal, noteworthy performances. Quentin Tarantino also does a near flawless job in the director's chair, bring just the correct amount of style, grit and humour. With quotable dialogue, memorable scenes and unforgettable characters `Pulp Fiction' is a near masterpiece. Working better in the more satirical moments, it probably isn't for the squeamish and definitely not for the easily offended. But if you want an offbeat, trendy ensemble thriller, then you won't go wrong with this. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10."
19 July 1999,bobc-5,2,7,8,Desperately seeking hipness,"""You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?"" It's inane, but it's entertaining and it sure seems witty when they're saying it, especially when you learn that this conversation is occurring on the way to knock off a group of possibly armed drug dealers. This is the casual manner in which you would like to talk with your friends and co-workers just before the big event goes down. This is dialogue that makes you feel hip just listening to it.Forget the salvation and redemption bit, this movie is all about making you feel hip. You feel hip when you get to listen in on the clever repartee, hip when you can be titillated by the gratuitous violence but still act blasé about it, hip when the sudden time jump doesn't bother you in the least. This movie makes you feel more hip then any other which has been made in quite a long time.Look beneath the hip surface, however, and you're left with little more than violence as entertainment. Violence in movies works best when used as a necessary device to support the plot, characters, and message. Tarantino reverses this relationship, creating plot and characters purely to support an entertaining sequence of violent situations. Each act of violence has its own specific purpose - make us laugh, make us jump, make us cheer, give us a vicarious thrill - and Tarantino is extremely skilled at making this work. This is the greatest strength of ""Pulp Fiction"", but ultimately its greatest weakness as well.The out-of-sequence scene demonstrates the extent to which the creation of entertaining violence was the driving force of the production. No doubt this was originally intended to be seen in its proper sequence but had to be removed because not only does it add nothing to the plot and character development, it actually bogs things down and gets in the way. Not wanting to lose his biggest laughs, however, Tarantino simply sticks it on the end and has the added bonus of now having a non-traditional narrative simple enough to not confuse his audience but sufficient to make them feel hip for being able to ""appreciate"" it.Is being hip enough? Not to be a classic, at least not in this case. Almost any hip movie is going to be firmly rooted in its own time period, but ""Pulp Fiction"" has lost it much more quickly than others. Although very entertaining and memorable in the initial viewing, its appeal fades quickly. When the hipness is gone, there's nothing left but violence, which doesn't make for a very pleasant viewing experience. Hip classics such as ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Goldfinger"" stay classics because they still give us fun and adventure even after the hipness has turned to camp. ""Pulp Fiction"" just gets ugly with time. Guns, drugs, and a couple hillbillies right out of ""Deliverance"" aren't enough to make a classic film."
17 January 2020,badcompanyx,1,1,10,A breath of fresh air,"Pulp Fiction did something that no other film had done at the time. Countless have mimicked it since, but only a few have even come close to succeeding. This was a breath of fresh air when it was first released and it continues to be a great watch time and time again. Perhaps the greatest film of all time. I give a perfect 10 out of 10 stars."

                        ",Frightening hitmen with humor. A decent film but not worth all the great reviews it gets,"This was a somewhat-decent film. Being about two bum hitmen who are just as funny as they are violent, I do not know why this film is so notorious for being ""violent"" and why it is talked about so much. The only real good thing about it was the excellent cast and the drama. There was little violence, with only 4 people shot in the film (including Travolta, who is shot after breaking into Willis's apartment) but the killings are quite brutal and Jackson always recites a Bible prayer before he does the killings. The acting is truly great though, and it is full of drama and different stories which finally come together at the end to have a pretty good movie but not worth all the great reviews. A decent film that should be watched if you have the time. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments."
19 February 2020,deanphillip,1,1,9,Tarantino,Tarantino is a master filmmaker and I was first introduced to him through this movie.

5 May 2021,eldreddsouza,1,3,10,A masterpiece in the truest sense!,"There are some films that are regarded by the general public as Best Pictures of all time. The Godfather, Forrest Gump, Shawshank and Pulp Fiction are some of those films. The thing with these classics is that there's so much hype around them that a viewer not having watched them before goes in with sky high expectations and needless to say, it leads to disappointment. I've found films like Shawshank, Forrest Gump good, but not that great as people hype them to which maybe the case for a variety of reasons. Enough of my backstory now let's get talking about this film.I can safely say, Pulp Fiction is The Best film ever made in my opinion. Hands down, the best picture ever. I had super high expectations from this film and I got to say I wasn't disappointed one bit. This indeed is a work of Art! A true masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino. High on style, high on entertainment and simply Fantastic!Samuel L Jackson has given the performance of his life in this along with John Travolta and Bruce Willis. Tarantino's direction is flawless and the story is one which has set the tone for future films of this genre. The intertwining anthology films. I see where all the new films have learnt from.Trust the hype guys, for it is real! What a spectacular film!"

5 June 2000,revival05,1,3,10,"Genius, definitely one of the best movies ever made","PULP FICTION is a masterpiece from start to finish. A couple of hard boiled stories, are waved together by only such perfection as Tarantino.Now, I'm not going to say that Big Q is my favorite director, but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. Just look at the script! And, just as in his other masterpiece RESERVOIR DOGS, the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. As a director, well, he's good but not that very original, with some exceptions like the PULP-dancesceen and the ending in DOGS. His real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. It is genius!!!PULP FICTION is my second favorite after STAR WARS (I'm not sure why I love that film, but hey, sue me) and it can't be compared to the rest of my top-movies, nor Tarantino's others. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a big flat joke to this, also NATURAL BORN KILLERS (Tarantino's story) and probably TRUE ROMANCE too. JACKIE BROWN is a good film, but it's one million floors down from this movie. The nearest so far is RESERVOIR DOGS. The direction of DOGS was better than PULP, but PULP FICTION has got this screenplay that no other (and I do mean NOT ONE) has got.Let's go on to... acting. Well, I'll put it like this: A majority of the actors do their best roles ever, here is my PULP FICTION ACTING-GUIDE: TRAVOLTA: Definitely his best role so far. His portrait of VINCE is a classic. It's cool, funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.Wallace's house. And the dancing-scene is also notable. Here we see that Travolta's dancing king age is still not over.JACKSON: It's a hard choice, but I'm pretty certain that this is his best performance I've seen. He's around everywhere, so it's tough but he tops. Still, it's easier concidering the fact that his performance is THE BEST IN THE MOVIE! The path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... THURMAN: I have never been such a tremendous fan of Uma Thurman, but this time wer'e talking COOL CHICK. It is a shame that she's only in like 1/5 of the movie. We should see more of her. KEITEL: No, mr.Wolf isn't his best. I'm rooting for mr.White or the priest in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. I know, it's a crap movie but the role is good. ROTH: Yeah, mr.Orange is better, but this one is on a good 2'nd place. RHAMES: His best role! Without a doubt. MARCELLUS WALLACE wer'e talking respect here. I'M GONNA GET MEDEVIL ON YOUR ASS!!!!!! He is one tough bastard. His scene with Willis was great, and every other scene he was into in this great, great movie. ARQUETTE: She isn't in this movie that much, but it is by far her best performance. STOLTZ: Eric Stoltz is a great actor, and I think every part he ever played is the best, and I'm sorry that he's not in this one that much. WILLIS: Bruce Willis might do his best performance, and the most quality-role but I have a very hard time if I'll ever try to forget JOHN McCLANE. This is his second best role.Well, let's not forget about ERIC ROBERTS and QUENTIN TARANTINO. Or should we? Yes, actually but let's try to focus on these two gentlemens too. Ok Roberts, everybody's hate victim and the biggest C-actor since DOLPH LUNDGREN. And Tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor.PULP FICTION has also got BLOOD and VIOLENCE. It is a strong, foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. If you really loved RESERVOIR DOGS... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? I can guarantee (yes, I can make out a promise, sue me if this is wrong) that you'll at least like this movie.ALSO: Great sound and cool soundtrack. I first saw this movie four years ago, and it is still just as great.Overall 10/10"
6 May 2002,nmp381,1,2,8,Violent and to the point,"Pulp Fiction is perhaps one of the most acclaimed movies of the 1990's. What it has going for it is superb editing, direction, and story.

It provides insight into why films like ""Crossroads"" make so much money! ""Pulp Fiction""  won Academy Awards here and in the UK for writing. Golden Globe awards, etc were thrown at this film because people in the know, love this movie. In contrast, films like Titanic, who get lots of hype, but win not one single award for acting or writing (just check and you will see that I am right), this film won many awards, and deserved each and every one. This holds especially true when you look at the competition that year (Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, among others).It cracks me up when I read these posts that make jokes about the fans of films like this one. They seem to always take jabs at the intelligence of those who like them. Well, I will take the gritty hard hitting dramas that are hailed by everyone who knows anything about films. You guys can watch ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" again. You might be able to follow that plot."

Woth it's blend of sweet-talking, back-chatting witt, 70's retro-pop culture, and invoative direction, it's remained a landmark of modern 90's cimena, and is still going strong today.The plot is quite simple, and relatively easy to follow--involving 3 stories which interlink into one another at one point in time or another. The first story, is about LA hitman Vincent Vega, played by TRVOLTA taking out his Boss' wife, Mia, to diner, and having to avoid th traditional boy-meets girl conversation, the second is a 'winner takes all' story, with Bruce Willis as a Boxer who is on the Run from his Boss, who is also Trvolta's Boss. Whereas the third sees Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson on a hit job gone wrong.
Like Reservoir Dogs, the movie is done in 'back to front' placement, where the beigining is teh end, the middle is the begining and the end is the prologue, etc. This was also the film which made Samuel L.Jackson's career, and put him at the top of the Hollywood foodchain, in coincidence, it was also the movie which put Travolta back in the 25 Million Dollar chain, making it one of the most legendary comebacks in History.The screenplay is really origional with lots of new witty cath phrases and ideolodgies implemented by Tarantino and Avary. More than anything else, the movie is about image, not story.Well worth the watch-- 8/10***"
23 October 2016,Margarida_do_Vale,29,59,5,Painfully overrated,"this movie is painfully overrated: every time someone tells me that pulp fiction is their favorite movie of all time, I die a little bit inside. Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."
24 July 2002,MrWhite2,1,2,10,The second best crime film ever made!,"A great follow-up to 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"". Not as good (just my opinion) , because when Reservoir Dogs came out , we did not know what to expect from Quentin Tarantino , and he shocked alot of audiences (in a good way). The film is set in L.A (like all Tarantino films) it is about two hitmen , one is a clumsy stupid , yet violent jerk , Vincent Vega (John Travolta) the other is kind of a smart , religious guy , Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and they work for a vicious drug lord Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Their lifes come together with a boxer who rips off Marcellus Wallace for alot of cash , Butch Collidge (Bruce Willis) and his spanish wife (Maria de Medeiros) , two drug dealers/junkies , Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife Jody (Rosanna Arquette) who sell heroin to Vincent Vega , two brittish bank robbers , Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) who decide to robb the diner they are in that just so happens that Vincent and Jules are dining in it too , a slick handyman Mr. Winston Wolf (Harvey Keital) that helps Jules and Vincent clean up a dead body out of their car and Marcellus Wallace's coke-addict wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) who Vincent takes out to dinner (orders from Marcellus) and almost dies on him. Known for its violent comedy and original theme , scored six Academy Award Nominations and one win for Best Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avery). This film is overall wonderful for anyone looking for fun at the movies. I liked it because of it's steaming originality and cool and twisted plot twists. Rent it today. Pulp Fiction Collector's Editon DVD is available this August."
10 December 2021,patrick-91640,2,7,4,Overrated and boring,"I do agree on serious acting, great style, and cult-ish impact on mainstream cinema. For that I give this movie some points.But let's put all the hype aside and pulp fiction is mostly boring. Casual non-sense dialogues, no plot, no character development or anything interesting whatsoever. In 2021 even the violence can't save the day."
14 June 2014,davidjohnson-27-97514,6,9,9,How to make a cool movie,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool."

30 May 2003,yoyomagoo,1,2,10,Undeniably great cinema,"Lauded by many, hated by others, Pulp Fiction is ambitious, provocative, shocking, funny and breathtaking at the same time (and, as you can see- in the same sentence). It is both a homage to all those ""pulp"" works of fiction out there and a fresh look at the crime genre.Quentin Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction is a set of three interconnecting tales focusing on sin and redemption. There is the story of the hit man who takes the boss' wife out for the night (with John Travolta as the hit man and Uma Thurman as the wife), a story of a failing boxer (played by Bruce Willis) and a story focusing on Samuel L Jackson's hit man- and his role in a diner stick-up. An eclectic supporting cast (including Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel and Quentin himself) add to the gritty, blended nature of the film.It is hard to pick out any distinct high or low points in pulp fiction in terms of the filmmaking itself as it is all so well executed. The performances (except with the possible exception of Tarantino) are uniformly nuanced and deep. The dialogue fizzes off the screen and conveys an interesting mix between mundane conversation and character insight. The direction and subsequent cinematography are all realistic yet subtlety stylish (see the diner scene for proof). All the stories and elements are linked together with a superb soundtrack full of undiscovered and well-known 70s songs which highlight the films seediness. Unlike some of the more recent films, this was the deserved winner of the Palm D'Or back when it was released. It is also, definitely contender for best film of the 1990s- and certainly the most fun."

                        ",My All-Time Favorite Movie,"This movie is wonderful.  It completely met the nearly unrealistic expectations I had for it.  This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that was able to keep my complete attention for more than an hour and a half.  I admit, I haven't seen quite a few of the movies on the top 250 list, but this is, by far, the best movie I've seen so far: A+"
14 June 2020,farshidn-02670,4,10,2,Why was this movie made?,"How can I trust in imdb rating any more?
Long story short. It was made to waste your time and mine watching 4 people puting their brains under pressure to get rid of a corpse and his blood in a car. Very exciting indeed. I could not blink.
Or maybe it was made to show a man loosing his virginity as punishment. What an Incredible story and full of deep meaning.
Don't believe 9 rating for this crap. I don't know were does it come from."
21 April 2005,OriginalMovieBuff21,1,4,10,The greatest film ever made,"Pulp Fiction has been my all-time favorite film for a couple of years now and I have seen many films in the past but nothing can out beat the film. Everything about the film was magnificent. The script, by one of my favorite directors Quentin Tarantino, is the best writings I have ever seen. The performances were brilliant. All of them played their roles perfectly especially Samuel L. Jackson, who played Jules Winnfield. The direction, camera view, dialouge, and humour were all amazing in this one of the most popular films ever made. Overall, in my opinion nothing can out stand Pulp Fiction and its flawless scenes. It definitely set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history and that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"

                        ",8.9 rating may even be underrated,"A complete masterpiece coming from the great Quentin Tarantino. Both the dialogues and the plot is amazingly interesting and well-written. Near-perfect performances from almost every actor (even brett is fabulous), arguably the best original screenplay ever written and great directing performance by tarantino. Simply a superb film that everyone must watch at least once in their lives."
9 July 2006,bald_tony,15,44,1,Why is this movie considered good?,"I was so looking forward to this movie because I had heard such great things about it. disappointed would be a huge understatement. what the Hell was this movie about? as far as I could tell there was no story, zero, nothing. literally nothing happened. there was no plot, no believable characters, not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion. just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie. I know movies are subjective, but I just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way. there are several films in the top 250 I have seen and agree they should be there. this belongs in the bottom 3, along with ""Fargo"" and ""American Beauty""."
2 January 2019,thatrandomguyhacks,2,3,10,My high expectations for this film were not met,I came in with huge expectations just to find a movie with more holes than a piece of swiss cheese. I love Bruce Willis but he sucked. My favorite part was the combo of Travolta and SLJ. That didnt mean I enjoyed it. It wasn't terrible but a film that high has never met my expectations so low.
31 December 2004,newkidontheblock,1,2,9,Wow...,"Saw Pulp Fiction today, and the only think I could say after it was...wow. 2 and a half straight hours of brilliant, but quite bloody. This was one of the best movies ever made, but also, maybe the most disturbing film of the 90's. This enforces my hypothesis that Q. Tarintino is a sick f**k, but a brilliant one.One other thing I noticed about the film was the number of ""f bombs"" dropped. Its like the only word people can say in L.A. is the ""f"" word. Language wise, this film made a George Carlin show look like Mr. Rogers. It made South Park look Tiny Toons. I'm not saying that profanity is all that bad, its just...did it really need so many? Soanyway, I would not suggest Pulp Fiction to the weak at heart or those partial to hard language, you will not believe your ears. Apart from that, see Pulp Fiction, its a great movie."
15 June 2013,kstroll66,71,173,1,Terrible,"This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own ""witty"" dialogue.The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, it's also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDb's list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like ""The Shawshank Revenge"". The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and it's amazing how many people fall for it."
30 May 2008,Ibuk,1,3,9,Pulp fiction- the epitome of cool,"I only viewed it for the first time a couple of months and I have to say from the moment go I loved it. It is a fascinating tale of how the main characters meet and how their paths cross over the course of the movie. I am not sure how people view it but I see Pulp Fiction as a series of episodes in one movie,my favourite being the one with Bruce Willis and what happens to him after he kills someone in the boxing ring. Another thing I loved was the star power in this movie:Uma Thurman,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Bruce Willis, Christopher Walker Ving Rhames to name a few. What makes the movie so remarkable is that we as the viewers do not see the twist coming. Another quite remarkable thing about Pulp Fiction is that the conversations between the characters is actually engrossing. Pulp Fiction is a fascinating tale masterfully directed by Quentin Tarranantino."

31 October 2002,garage5inc,1,2,10,Best picuture of the 1990's,"10/10 Easily, this is a must see for anyone fifteen and up.Step aside Forrest Gump...I originally heard this was one of the coolest movies made in the 90's and that the music was perfectly intertwined with the story. Both were absolutely correct, but I will give you a review that will make you drive to Blockbusters right now and rent it or buy it.""What do two hitmen, a briefcase, a prizefighter, and a gold watch have in common?"" Pulp Fiction starts off with the music ""Jungle Boogie"" in the credits which we see later is actually a radio being tuned in by John Travolta (who was on a self-destructing movie career mode for almost 15 years until this) and Samuel L. Jackson (in his best performance to date) two hitmen who work in LA need to collect something from small-time crooks who screwed their vengeful boss (Ving Rhames) over. From start to finish Pulp Fiction's dialogue is the most known, most recognizable, and most quoted in cinematic history. Travolta and Jackson enter the apartment with guns ready, amusingly talking about how fast food in America is different than fast food in Europe and other such things.  Pulp Fiction immediately grabs your attention when Jackson and Travolta storm into the apartment room and demand answers, a briefcase, and a taste of a Big Kahuna burger. When Travolta opens up the briefcase we see a gold light emit from it, every single person who has seen this movie has a different opinion on what could be inside, but it's never revealed. In some very memorable dialogue Jackson intimidates the crooks by demanding answers on why they did what they did first by shooting one of them while another is trying to talk his way out of his death and saying to the leader of the group ""OH I'M SORRY DID I BREAK YOUR CONCENTRATION?"" Jackson shouts out his death-sentence prayer which might give you a chill the first time you see it and then opens fire on him while we see the gold light flash on Jackson and Travolta simeltaniously.Pulp Fiction consists of a few Oscar-Winning stories by Quentin Tarantino.Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace The Gold Watch The Bonnie SituationEach story is intertwined and reveals to us the true side of American crime and situations in the early 80's. The begining starts out, followed by the scene after the last scene, then a flashback, followed by the real end of the story where all loose ends are tied up, and then the first scene of the movie ties to the last scene. Sounds difficult? Absolutely not! Roger Avary and QT have made this complex story so simple almost anyone can understand it, and that is by no means a bad thing at all.Comedy, Dialogue, Drugs, Dancing, The Gold Watch, Boxing Incident, An Accidental Meet Between Two Small Time Bank Robbers In Love And Two Philosophical Hitmen, and The Gimp is how to explain Pulp Fiction. After seeing Pulp Fiction, it will almost definately go on your top 10 list of movies of all time.

23 May 2021,Samir_Ranjan,1,1,10,Simply Brilliant,What a brilliant movie. The only time I liked John Travolta. Every aspect of the movie is just superb.
18 November 2015,b27922,7,11,9,Classic Masterpice,"Tarantino is one of the best directors of the world to himself. His Cinematographic was spectacular. Pulp Fiction was model for young filmmakers around the world with so many great scene.It's Brilliant.Tarantino borrowed amazing classic movie. combine them in best way then make his own masterpiece. soundtrack was great too. The Characterizations was awesome. It was nominated Oscar.Travolta dancing with Thurman was good.I really enjoyed to watch this movie. Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
9 November 2021,elizabeth_777,1,2,10,almost as good as Sky High(2005),"I'm a big fan of this movie, even though it gets a bad ""bro movie"" reputation. I think it's genius and very well done. Definitely one of the best films of the 90s. Though, the gold watch sequence is pretty boring and i often will skip it."
16 May 2004,psychogoatee,1,2,10,Best movie of the 90's,"Pulp Fiction could be my favorite movie, but that always changes. I will say that I consider Pulp Fiction to be the best movie of the 90's, with only Goodfellas and The Big Lebowski coming close. The cast has top notch chemistry, featuring the best performances of most of their careers. Travolta and Jackson's duo is one of the most memorable and entertaining in the history of cinema. Tarantino's dialogue and direction come together to make one of the most quoted, most watchable, and most influential films of the 90's. Tarantino misorders the films acts chronologically, to the effect of telling a character centered story in the most satisfying way possible. This has been attempted many times since, but never equaled. Tarantino's best film, a modern classic."
16 November 2020,micahallen-25585,4,6,9,Film Perfection At It's Finest,"Pulp Fiction is the film with no meaning, and it's easily perfect. Pulp Fiction displays true growth of story, Oscar worthy acting from Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and John Travolta. The story is moderately difficult to follow as the story unfolds with no certain timeline until the end. Overall, it's the finest piece of Tarantino's work and for the artistic viewer it is a perfect movie for the right mind."
25 November 2020,thalesufv,4,6,10,My favorite movie of all time,"Even after watching it a hundred times, it's an enjoyable ride.
We are thrown in a few different stories which are interconnected. We meet a couple of hitman, their boss and his wife, two robbers and a boxer that's over his prime.
The dialogues and monologues consume quite a bit of the time, but they are so great that we end up craving for more. They give you a pretty good idea of who the characters are and what they stand for. It's something we've come to expect from every Tarantino movie, but it was done especially well in this one.
The star filled cast is just unbelievable. It's amazing how they all leave their distinct mark in the story.
All in all, in Pulp Fiction, we get Tarantino at his best: bloody, dirty, funny and simply awesome."
27 March 2004,angie-belle,10,30,1,overrated,"I don't know what everyone is talking about, but watching the back of my hand for two hours while a small cat constantly bit me was way more entertaining than watching this movie. I'd put off seeing this movie for years for fear of being bored. Unfortunately, when it was forced in at a party, I couldn't escape. I sat there like a normal person awaiting a plot and something entertaining. However, the words ""I don't get it"" and ""God please make this end!"" were constantly repeated in my head over and over again. I think Tarintino is one of a kind and in a good way. I just don't get what's so great about this movie. Bottom line, I still believe that when too many stars enter a film, it will suck. Maybe one day I'll be proven wrong."
14 February 2020,TheAll-SeeingI,1,4,10,It Changed Cinema and Storytelling,"""Pulp Fiction"" changed cinema, showcasing a filmmaker with a knife-sharp clarity of vision operating wholly unshackled at the very height of his powers. From its shrewd curations of pop culture to its electrically charged creatures of the underbelly, Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece navigates our dirty back rooms with a wild ambition, darkly searing wit, and a gut-level intelligence like no other.Yet before the first frame was shot, ""Pulp Fiction"" was already a towering master class in screenwriting, and in all phases of that complex game: Brilliant, scorching dialogue, uniquely consuming character sketches, and a savant-like melding of unorthodox, fragmented structure into a seamless whole all conspired to light the fuse on a film that upon detonation would tear down the limiting confines of cinematic structure. ""Pulp Fiction"" liberated the way stories are told.Over 25 years after its release, ""Pulp Fiction"" remains an insurgent candidate for film's very greatest work. And while its final resting place in the order of things is debatable, its atomic impact on everything that followed is not. - (Was this review of use to you?

                        ",Beat It,"There is no film that has touched me, and few that have touched anyone, as much as this one. Tarantino has a penchant for violence, as do many of the big name actors, like Jackson and Willis. But so does the human race. There's more to us and more to the film.The fact that it creates so many unanswered questions, the fact that I can watch it again and again and still see new things, even it's ""tie-ins"" to other QT movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it.It's ironic that such a pulp/pop film could do it, but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts, a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with Reb flags, and a world of people with accents from faraway places. It adds to a mystery - Where is it from (Fabienne's accent)? Why is she (Esmerelda Villalobos) here? None of these are crucial to the plot. Just like subway chatter and personal romance are not necessary for survival.Yet we find ourselves doing them, day in and day out.Why does Marsellus have a band-aid? What's in the briefcase? Why does mindless violence fascinate us? Why are we enamored with the intricate?"
6 January 2019,Habibi-Universe,1,2,8,Classic Tarantino,"What a great movie by Quentin Tarantino set in the late 1980s/early 1990s. A typical classic. In my opinion, this is not Quentin's finest and best work as I prefer some of his other movies such as Django Unchained, but this is definitely his most iconic picture. For some reason, Quentin Tarantino always manages to pull off such great dialogue in his movies which have a very nice flair to them. Dialogue, which is clearly one of his strengths, build up rising tension and as a viewer you never know what is going to happen next in the scene. There are some unexpected twists in the movie that really shocked me. I found myself gasping a few times throughout the movie. 'Pulp Fiction' is just another great example of what a fantastic writer and director Quentin Tarantino really is. My favourite performance in this movie was by far Samuel L Jackson's one. He really shined throughout every single scene with his great acting presence. It is always such a joy for me to watch this brilliant man act. Another actor who I liked way more than expected was the great Bruce Willis whose performance really surprised me since I had never seen him act so well before. This movie is fantastic, sure does it feel different to other movies you have seen, but that's what makes a movie great and stand out from others. I whole-heartedly recommend this amazing piece of fiction to everyone who is a film fan and doesn't mind a little bit of gore. This my friends, is a true classic! 8.5/10"
17 July 2000,davidshi,2,3,10,The Ultimate Movie,"This film has everthing, in perfect balances - drama, humor, violence, wisdom, love; it has wonderful dialog and interesting characters. I can play this DVD 24 hours a day, the episodic nature of the movie is such that you can watch part of it one day then watch other parts at other times without feeling you missed key plot points.I wish every writer and director took the effort to carefully sculpt and craft every aspect of a movie like Tarantino does."

28 December 2001,SinHippie,1,1,10,I love this movie!,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it and that is why I think it is one of the best to come along in quite awhile!  Don't look for this to be an uplifting or moving experience.  All there is to see is the disgusting underbelly of society, which I think needs to be shown. Tarantino may have blown his mental load on this picture but that is o.k. The dialog is just top notch.  I haven't really told you anything about the movie but this is just the best example of what the movie is about....nothing.  But it still kicks ass."
18 June 2019,TheLazyTiger,2,3,8,Tarantino does something useful,It's an off pace over the top storyline with excellent acting that works. You don't need a 10 page review for this movie. If you haven't seen just go watch it.
10 December 2006,jetsmets222,4,7,10,Genius!,"There is only one word that can describe this movie, Genius! This movie is Quentin Tarrantino at his best. Of all the people I watched the movie with, not one of them said it was anything less that brilliant. You will find yourself quoting this movie for weeks and weeks to come. This is the best movie since the Godfather. If there is one movie Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis or Tim Roth should be remembered for it is this one. A classic Samuel L. Jackson movie. No other movie has a dialouge like this. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat for the two and half hours that fly by while you enjoy this classic."
22 January 2015,MUFCOK,1,3,9,A Masterpiece.,"There is not much that can be said about Pulp Fiction that hasn't been said countless times before, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and is never far away from the number one spot on many peoples lists. Acting – Spot on. Characters – Spot on.Script – Spot on. Storyline – almost non-existent but isn't that the point? Spot on. Soundtrack – Spot on. Editing – Spot on. Quentin Tarantino – Genius.Pulp Fiction is a complete joy to watch. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson give the performances of their careers. Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames & 'The Wolf' all give great supporting performances also.Pulp Fiction is an utterly pointless film; it is a movie that relies heavily on its characters and their scripts. The storyline is basic and feels unfinished but that is the entire point! It is a movie about nothing, it's simply a snippet into the lives of the characters and the timeline is all over the place, jumping backwards and forwards throughout the film. It follows two hit-men, a gangster, an underground boxer, drug dealers & a man who is contracted to get people out of the stickiest of situations, with complete calm!As 'perfect' as it is, I do have a problem with it. It's a controversial problem no doubt, and that is Bruce Willis and his hour long scene in the centre of this movie. I wouldn't say I dislike Bruce Willis as such but I do find him somewhat irritating and when I watch Pulp Fiction I do skip his scenes. In my opinion he isn't relevant and I don't feel the film would have missed his presence if he wasn't involved. This however doesn't affect my feelings for the film as a whole as the scenes with Jackson & Travolta are faultless and some of my favourite scenes in cinema. I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.10/10"

It's the best 2 and a half hours that you can watch in a movie! It is basically a bunch of mini-plot lines with some reoccurring characters. It's about hit-man Vince Vega(John Travolta) taking his boss Marcellus(Rhames)'s wife Mia(Thurman) out to dinner, only leading to disaster of a drug overdose. It's about hit-man Jules Winfield(Jackson) having divine intervention and realising what he has become...nothing but a killer. It's about a boxer named Butch(Willis) who was payed to lose a fight, but won instead and has the mob boss Marcellus mad. It's about two diner thieves, Pumpkin(Roth) and Yolanda(Plummer) who rob the wrong place at the wrong time. It's about a man's head who is accidentally blown off, and the only one who can help is the cleanup man called the Wolf(Keitel), and it's finally about two gay rapers(Whitaker and Greene) who try to work their magic. It's a terrific movie, and it's set up so cool. It's in three chapters and out of chronological order so it stays fresh. Also, all the main stars(not co-starring) are mostly only special appearances where they star in the film for a brief amount of time, like Walken as a war hero. Watch it...it's excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!! 135%/100%. rated R for some bloody violence, nonstop strong language, very strong drug content(very graphic), some off screen sexuality and brief nudity. 149 minutes.*watch for Steve Buscemi and Kathy Griffin in cameo roles."

25 December 2018,Mohican15,1,2,8,Tarantino's Magnum Opus!,"Genius! Pure genius, is what this film is! Though INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED and JACKIE BROWN are among my favourite QT movies, none of Tarantino's other work is quite as much fun, as inventive or as darn quotable as PULP FICTION! It's a true 'cult movie' of the highest order, and a true, movie, gem from the 90s!Never has Tarantino's dialogue been so juicy, his story so much fun or his characters so iconic (apart from Mr. Blonde or Hans Landa, of course!). There's just so much to enjoy from this movie as Tarantino pulls together one his best casts including Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman and unforgettably, Samuel L. Jackson! Tarantino also crafts one of the best soudntracks in cinematic history; using some of the greats like Al Green, Dusty Springfield, and Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell"" in the so-bad-that-it's-good dance sequence (which I intend to dance with my future wife at our wedding someday)!Every scene is laced with killer, totally quotable dialogue and who here, isn't aware by now, that a Quater Pounder with Cheese in France, is called ""Royale With Cheese""? It's probably (save INGLOURIOUS and DJANGO) Tarantino's best script, with the dynamite dialogue and brilliant, yet baffling use of the non-linnear storyline. Never have Tarantino's storylines ever captured the imagination in such an explosive way as we follow two hit men, a mobster's wife, a boxer and a pair of diner-robbing, adrenaline junkies!I'm not saying it's perfect; there's stuff you'll hate, there's stuff that will shock you and there's stuff that will disgust you as the film deals with the illegal, criminal, underworld of Los Angeles. As iconic as it was, being a Christian, I was not entirely comfourtable with Tarantino's version of the Bible verse from Ezekiel but on a whole, I found myself moved by Jules Winnfield's (Samuel L. Jackson's) tale of redemption as the hitman who has a dramatic change of heart since it shows that even a hired killer, is not without soul or humanity.Like I said, this film is about crime but the real crime is that Samuel L. Jackson didn't get an Oscar for his role! He is frankly masterful as he lyrically waxes about burgers, pigs and moral codes. He's BY FAR, the best part of the film and is able to appear comical and terrifying at the same time.Every factor of this film fits together perfectly and to paraphrase from INGLOURIOUS: ""I Think This Just Might Be Tarantino's Masterpiece!"""

But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review.The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages.The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner.The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie.It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be."

I purchased it and thought I would love it because I like gangster and shoot-em-up movies, like Boondock Saints and Scarface. However, I do have a disliking of Quintin Tarantino, I hated the Kill Bills and I just don't like Quintin Tarantino as a person. I feel like the movie lacked motivation and moved slow until the last twenty minutes. There were several plot gaps that left me hanging and the twisting story line that was supposed to be theatrical was just stupid and unattached to any part of the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the fact that it had an all star cast. I'm sorry if you disagree and you all probably will but this movie JUST SUCKED!!!"
14 November 2004,PiranianRose,1,2,10,remarkable film-making,"Pulp Fiction is remarkable in the sense that it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking; yet when you piece the parts together, the unified film is refreshing and captivating. Quentin Tarantino as a fan implements cross-genre references ranging from Spaghetti Westerns to Asian action films. Not entirely bound by any genre, Pulp Fiction reinvents modern cinema in many ways, and QT has created a unique identity with his dialogue-driven stories and implied offscreen violence, among other creative styles.A good film does not necessarily need any jaw-dropping scene by itself, but it must work as a total system. While Pulp Fiction may or may not put you on the edge of your seat at any time, the entire film is well crafted to form a memorable and entertaining cinematic experience."
4 August 2019,joelnova93,1,2,10,"Dialogue, Non-Linear Story + Multiple Plot Combining","What Tarantino can teach you about writing is that characters shouldn't just be pieces on a board to move the plot along, but they should be living, breathing citizens of the world the writer crafted for the viewers.That's why his films are so long, and pace so slowly: You sit with the characters. Hang out with them. Get to know them long enough so that they show you their quirks.On top of all this, Tarantino engages the viewer even further by writing multiple intersecting plot lines that are portrayed out of order, which is very satisfying as all the puzzle pieces come together.Knowing a little bit about a character's future can let the viewer breathe, and calling back to a familiar situation from a new angle is suspenseful to wonder WHEN or HOW that new element will play out.Overall a very refreshing, very wild movie.

24 January 2008,bfoelber,4,6,9,Magnificent,"For those who appreciate great films, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must see. The movie is Tarantino's 2nd work after having great success with his gangster story of ""Reservoir Dogs"". There are many unique aspects of Pulp Fiction that make it so good. As many of you know, Tarantino's use of dialogue that he gives the characters in his films is excellent, humorous, and intelligent. Pulp Fiction is by far his best in this aspect. From conversations talking about foot massages to talking about filthy animals; PF has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. The movie is shuffled in a way that it tells the story out of sequence, once again a redundant aspect in most Tarantino films. This influenced many different mob films, but no other movie will ever be as great as Pulp Fiction. Film making at its finest.$$$"
4 October 2009,ennieday09,1,2,10,"Tarantino's greatest, and every other actor in this movie's greatest achievement","Pulp- ""A soft moist shapeless mass of matter"" Pulp Fiction- one of the greatest movies not just of the 90's but possibly all time and will not be surpassed by any of its genre for quite some time.This movie sparks the genius and creativity of Quentin Tarantino. A single masterpiece that gives you almost everything you could look for in Crime, Suspense and Drama. Each storyline that is thrown at you drags you in for a wild ride that leaves you wanting more with each scene and climax. Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary deliver the biggest set of characters in any other movie I could possibly remember. After learning that this movie only won one Academy Award for best screenplay I thought what a sham. Nothing against Forrest Gump at all but this movie blew me away with each scene as it developed and if this movie did not deserve best picture, no other movie did.The cast of this film is incredible with such A-list actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and many many other great performances. Each story drags you into the lives of each character and each is just intriguing as the next. Samuel Jackson is the star of this picture in my opinion because with each line of dialog he delivers keeps you in awe and amazement. This movie will stick in my mind for years to come and I'm sad I didn't embrace this epic earlier. Pulp Fiction is in every way a masterpiece, nothing else to say"

But seriously it’s hard to find words to describe a near flawless work of art. You will either love it or hate it. But you will have to watch it regardless of what everyone else says. Pulp fiction is truly fiction …and Quentin Tarantino (one of my favorite directors) has crafted this masterpiece to bring a bit of everything into it. There was no movie and there won’t be any movie that can be made in the same fashion as Pulp Fiction. It sets a class of its own. It is undoubtedly ‘one in a million’. The acting is superb, the screenplay unmatched, the script engaging and the direction could not be any better. Violent and real, it brings life onto the screen in the first five minutes. This is one movie I would see in the theatre again – if were re-released that is. But *sigh* we have to get used to the DVDs now."
23 November 2015,ryansmith-97575,7,11,9,Action packed,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick. I recently had to pick my top five movies of all time that I enjoyed and this made the list, following Fight Club and many great films to the same strength and fortitude."

This movie has everything you want, everything you are looking for, in a word is perfect!!! The actors play their characters wonderfully and the editing is genial.I think it will be very hard to make a movie like this in the future because Pulp Fiction is unique, is a masterpiece.All the scenes of the movie are perfect. The one I prefer is when Mr. Wolf arrives at Jimmies'house and he introduces himself to Vincent and Jules like a real professional worker: a wonderful playing.Dialogs are the thing that makes this movie great: during its 154 minutes you never get bored and you think that the runtime of the movie is not so long.10 stars out of 10."
5 July 2013,Papatheodorou,2,3,10,"Even today, Tarantino's Masterpiece is an Exceptional Crime Thriller","Pulp Fiction was released back in 1994, and now, nearly twenty years later (as of 2013), Tarantino's first real masterpiece can still be compared to some of the crime movies of today. Critically acclaimed across the world, we are presented with four interweaving stories about mob hit-men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a couple looking to rob a diner, and it deserves it's acclaim.Quentin Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was a word of mouth success. Little was known about this raw, raunchy crime thriller from an unknown writer/director, but it became a cult classic quickly. Therefore, his follow-up film needed to be good, and he delivers.Anyway, on to Pulp Fiction. The Academy Award-Winning film contains four interweaving stories. They are gritty and foul-mouthed, but truly spectacular. Only few times have writer/directors been able to pull off such astounding films. Without dipping into spoilers, I can safely say that Pulp Fiction is like a dive of a cliff for first-time Tarantino viewers. You think it's risky attempting it, but when you do, you're hooked. It's this film that truly made Tarantino who he is today, and it's this film that can still stand the test of time, one of the rare few.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece I can't wait to watch again. A truly spectacular film on all levels. A beautiful crime drama that accurately dips you into the crime world in ways we've never been dipped before, and I can't wait to get dipped again.10/10"

                        ",One of the best of the 90's,"Pulp Fiction along with Goodfellas ranks for me as the two coolest and best movies of the 90's. This film is simply the bizz its got everthing and I can watch this over and over again and it will seem better and better each time I view it. Its a clever, witty, violent celebration of junk culture, that relys a bit too heavily on past thrillers but its blessed with some excellent performances which crackle with menace.Samuel L.Jackson and John Travolta have never been nor will they be better and Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman were also great in support.This is a very funky, American sort of pop masterpiece, improbable, uproarious, with bright colors and danger and blood right on the surface.Mark: 9/10"

                        ",What am I missing?,"I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time in 2004.  I hope that's the reason why I don't think this is the great modern classic that everybody else does. However, 1994 was not that long ago.  Movies have not changed that much in the last 10 years.  All I heard about Pulp Fiction for years was how violent it was.  I'm sorry, it really just wasn't.  The supposedly brilliant and original characters in this movie don't really seem brilliant or original to me.  There all just kind of losers.  They're just losers in that glorified Tarantino way.  I thought both Kill Bills were much better than this movie.Finally, let me say that just because a movie jumps around between stories and characters does not automatically make it a good movie."
31 August 2009,threewishes,4,7,10,A cinematic experience,"I saw this for the first time today. And whilst I cannot say I loved pulp fiction, it is extremely difficult to criticise. I gave it a 10 rating purely for its quality; it deserves nothing less. It was my curiosity to know 'what the big deal is?' that led me to finally see it. And whilst i'm not qualified to say that the film was a turning point in cinematic history, redefining its genre and such, it is undeniably an excellently executed film. If film-making could be eloquent this would be a prime example. As one reviewer pointed out, the story did not need to be told, but none-the-less it is given such style and energy and...pizazz that it feels worth it. The word 'pulp' does full justice to both its definitions. Perhaps to someone who has experienced enough cinema pre-pulp fiction, it could be seen as a slap-in-the- 'this is how you tell a story folks!'. It shows that you can take characters that the audience usually treats as one-dimensional plot devices/illustrators and turns them into the 4-dimensional complex beings that they are. The characters can no longer be construed even in the loosest sense as 'good' or 'bad' and I don't think it particularly matters. People aren't good or bad; that is what makes them complex and interesting and most importantly - human.The dialogue is sharp, well-timed and original. A lot of the spoken word conversations are extremely ordinary in content, but they have the ability to make you think. It is the sort of observation you would usually keep to yourself rather than say out loud, almost as if the characters don't think before they speak. The acting of course is flawless as one would expect with the great slew of well-used talent.I could not recommend this film to anyone but a true film enthusiast - it is a fine piece of art with a 'devil may care' attitude. Too cool for school but smart enough to know its boundaries. I am certainly curious to see what else Tarrantino has to offer."

                        ","Insightful, wonderful, geeky","Pulp Fiction is the ultimate playground for the mind of Quentin Tarrantino. The movie is a blindingly repressed spewage of pop culture, brilliant setup, drug excrement, softcore porn, and a magnificent mixture of philosophy, religion and violence.  The movie's mood almost has us as tied to a chair as Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis are in the excruciatingly painful gimp sequence.  Thus retrained, we are blasted on a whirlwind tour of the hippest of the hip.  So hip, in fact, that we want to blow our brains out after it is over.  Samuel Jackson gives the performance that will undoubtedly mark his career.  It is a performance that is disturbed, hysterical, deadly, funny, compassionate, smart and scared (yes, scared.)  He's a quote dynamo and is given more great things to say then possibly any character in movie history.  Travolta is slick, slimy and stupidly sharp in his role.  He's one of the few guys who comes off as an actor in this movie and not a lost soul in the new wave beat generation of the mid-90's.  The cast is a who's who of the best cult actors of the mid-90's and Tarrantino gets them to deliver stunning performances.  And why not?  The dialogue is possibly the best written verbage for any film ever made and is a Holy Grail for fans of offbeat and subculture cinema.  From ""the holiest of holies"" to ""correctamundo"", the movie is the masterpiece for a guy so immersed in pop culture that he needs an oar to navigate it all.  Roth is dynamic in a relatively small part and Ammanda Plummer is like a shrieking little wicked witch.  Uma Thurman is a thinking man's dream.  She's vulnerable, demonstrative, and most of all, playful.  The dancing sequence is priceless and needs no further discussion.  Eric Stoltz is like that cool guy that everyone knew in high school that no one really paid much attention to but everyone liked.  Bruce Willis is also in his zone as Butch the boxer. Willis has a nice blend of sensitivity and brutality.  Any more or less probably would not have worked.  The movie also rips on all cultures virutally equally with a burst of fresh air.  The movie is more sympathetic towards blacks and not at all towards Southerners but that is par for the course in the civil rights revival in the 1990's.  Shooting a movie of this length out of sequence was a tremendous gamble but the dialogue holds it together and it is, doubtlessly, brilliantly creative.  The movie's weakness, like other Tarrantino movies, is it's obsession with believing that the drug subculture is somehow right about life and most other facets are somehow less then right or flat out wrong.  Tarrantino evolved this idea slightly by the end of the movie and continued it in one of the best B-movies ever made, From Dusk Till Dawn.  However, Tarrantino's glorification of radicalism gets old at times and falls flat by the end of the movie due to it's length.  All in all, this movie is an all time classic for cinema junkies and pop culture nuts and will pop like champagne in circles away from the power players and the mainstream."
4 August 2018,mtrburrows,1,2,9,Cinematic Masterpiece?,"What's to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This is the best example in cinema history of character building and fantastic dialogue. You have to give credit to the genius that is Quentin Tarantino when he can take a relatively uneventful and straight forward narrative and pull it out of order and craft amazing characters in order to make it one of the best movies of all time. So quotable, so well acted, so iconic, truly one of the best scripts put to film!"
7 November 2018,FilmLiquet,1,2,8,Film Liquet on Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction follows a non-linear narrative structure, meaning it is told out of chronological order. It follows three interlaced stories of multiple characters. One follows the story of Vince Vega (John Travolta), as he and his friend Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) arrive at an apartment in order to retrieve a briefcase that belongs to their boss. They murder one of the guys that stole it and then Jules recites an Ezekiel passage from the bible before executing the other one, as they double-crossed their boss. This is where the iconic lines are said by Samuel L. Jackson - ""I dare you mother*cker, I double dare you"".Being a Tarantino classic, this film blew up back at the date of its release, because of how violent and real it seemed. The characters are very believable and the brilliance of the film is smug. Everyone's destiny in the film plays out, either coming to a halt or ending in a further story. The non-linear structure, divided into different stories, makes it seem like you are reading a book, which switches character perspectives in order to tell you more, but at the same time leave you wanting more information. The situations in the film are absurd, unique, inventive even, the same can be said for the dialogue, as the audience is left guessing, not knowing what anyone will say at any moment, seeing how wild and alive it is. The characters never sound the same.Showing the life of the 90's throughout its' characters, the film does not leave you bored, trying to entertain you with aforementioned situations, as Tarantinos' writing is meant to and knocking you off your feet, as the absurd takes its turn, another timeless classic shows us how films are supposed to be made."

6 January 2022,nikosklimentos,1,2,7,Good but overrated and inconsistent.,"Too bad we can't rate this movie by each individual story. The Butch/Marsellus storyline makes the entire movie worth watching and that deserves a 9/10! Everything else is extremely hit or miss. I thought the restaurant scene w/ Thurman and Travolta was very boring and I didn't care for the final 40 minutes at all. I'm sure it was ahead of its time, but in 2022 its just decent as a whole."
21 June 2008,yearspew,1,2,10,My Favorite 90s Movie.,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is perhaps the most original film I've ever seen. I know I may sound like an overstatement, but when I watched this film for the first time I had never watched anything like it before. The characters, the nonlinear storyline, the dialogue, the costume design. I loved it instantly.I don't care how many people call Tarantino a hack and Pulp Fiction overrated. I will always praise this movie because I truly believe that it's an amazing example of great film-making and very original writing.What I love the most are the characters. Good characters can make up for a weak plot. Pulp Fiction doesn't really have much of a plot at all. As Tarantino said, it's the merging of very well known plots (gangster going out with the boss's wife, boxer supposed to throw the fight) but it's the way they're told what makes this movie so great.Anyway, every single character is memorable. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) being perhaps the most popular. Even though is Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) who's featured in the poster. My favorite is The Wolf, played masterfully by Harvey Keitel.Which leads me to the acting. I think the actors did a terrific job playing these characters. For example, my favorite ever John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel performances are from this movie. And I'm sure that in the case of Jackson, most people will agree.The dialogue is superb, very quotable and fun to listen to. Every character has great interaction with all the other characters. Whether it's Vincent and Jules discussing miracles and Royales with Cheese, Marsellus (Ving Rhames) telling Butch (Bruce Willis) that in the fifth his ass goes down, or The Wolf explaining why he didn't say ""please"", Pulp Fiction has some of the best dialogue ever written.Overall, a movie I love and one of the best movies of all time."

                        ",Quentin Tarantino creates a masterpiece.,"Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not ""Glorified"" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement."
28 November 2006,mihaimm-1,3,6,10,"Disturbing, shocking....","This is one of the best movies of all times.It is shocking and filled with useless violence. It is disgustingly realistic. But it also shows some of the most disturbed, dangerous and cruel personalities that I could imagine still having trances of humanity in them.While reading some of the ""I hated it"" comments I can't stop from remarking that what they are saying is true. Of course sodomy, sickening drug use, useless violence, accidental shootings and filth of the language are not amusing. And frankly speaking the characters are build using especially the utterly pointless dialog, the coolness of their looks, the idiotic jokes that so many mistake for attempts at comedy. Those are the characters.Also... if you think art is about telling you a story just like the ones your mama used to read at bed-time... think again. Art is about feelings. Not about stories. I have yet to see a great book/painting/sculpture/music/film that is about the story. Sure, the story is there. But it does not matter were it takes you, what matters is what leaves behind.Yes, this movie is not entertaining, it is not nice, it is racist and it is degrading. And it is so to the point were you actually ask yourself... can this be happening? Can this be real? And then you are just saying to yourself ""I'm so glad it's not my reality..."""

11 July 2021,writersbuddy,1,1,9,"From a younger viewer, this movie is worth watching.","This film is somehow able to tell the stories of many different people, yet be cohesive and interconnected without making it obvious. Few movies are able to tell the story of one person successfully, but this film is able to tell multiple.The storytelling is exciting, suspenseful, and in some aspects quite deep. It will make you feel happy, fearful, and surprised.I've been putting off watching this movie for a long time and am glad I finally took the time."

Quentin Tarantino is the one of the best directors in the world.The plot is great the script is even better, and the actors ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You got to rent or buy this movie now. John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Bruce willis and all the other great actors makes this movie to the best movie ever. Quentin Tarantino made Reservoir dogs also and it is very good to, but this movie is better. I give this movie 10 out of 10."

                        ","After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water...","Often copied but never duplicated, Pulp Fiction was an absolute sensation when it came out in 1994. It became an audience favourite, received universal praise from critics, won the Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and made director Quintin Tarantino into a household name. How many films out there can you fit into this category?Pulp Fiction is so famous for several reasons. First off, it's one of the most original films of the 90's. When most movies out there are either remakes, sequels, based on books, or on actual events, Tarantino gives us 2-inch sirloin steak that's bloody as hell. The plot is several stories all interelated in someway or another that weave in and out over a period of about 48 hours (give or take and afternoon) all within the shifty comings and goings of the LA drug life. Each story connects the characters together, like a puzzle within a puzzle, and is all held together strongly with a fantastic cast (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis) and Acadamy Award worthy performances.Secondly, it has tremendous dialogue. Quintin Tarantino is an absolute genius in crafting the film's Oscar winning screenplay. This isn't made up nonsense. This stuff is real. Many of the dialogue you could so easily overhear from the people talking behind you in the grocery line. They're conversations of reality, and this is what helps make the film so good. And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it.After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it."
4 September 2004,Brad2002,1,2,9,A different kind of movie,"Tarentino is very good at breaking the rules and doing his own thing with movies. It's been tried many times, but, for some reason, Tarentino can pull it off time after time. I'm sure you haven't seen a movie quite like this one before.It's actually a bunch of stories put together in one movie, but, yet, they're all connected. It's not that any of the stories are completely original, it's just the way the movie is put together. It's non linear, for one thing. You see the end of the story at the beginning of the movie and the rest of the scenes are out of place as well, but somehow it all works. In the hands of someone other than Tarentino, I'm sure it would have been a huge mess.The thing that's best about Tarentino is the dialog. He has the best knack out of all writers to create believable everyday dialog that's still interesting. As a person who's dabbled in writing, it is difficult to create good, authentic dialog, without boring the reader. If you've ever listened to two people talk in a restaurant or something, you'll know what I mean - dull as a felt tip marker. Tarentino can create authentic sounding dialog without making it boring. This movie is worth watching just for that.The acting was very well done and most of the characters were original and non-stereotyped. Travolta was particularly good and showed he was capable of doing drama as well as comedies and musicals.If you want to see something different, this is one you don't want to miss. It well deserves to be in the top 100 on the IMDb list."
24 December 2002,shannon5760,5,17,3,Skip this movie!!!,"Over the last 3 years, I have seen over 100 movies per year. I finally got around to seeing Pulp Fiction. This movie was very slow for most of the movie, had very weak plots, and was not entertaining. It was also very violent, so parents should think twice about letting their children see this movie. If you are one of the many people who fall into the trap of liking a movie because it is 'different', then maybe you'll like this movie. For everyone else, I recommend skipping this movie!!! It was a waste of 2 hours and 45 minutes."
23 August 2012,g_ryder,1,2,9,"Look for the signs, the miracles in your life, never dismiss anything as a freak coincidence.","Is there a theme and message in this crime-action-thriller? Yes there is, and not only is it explicit but also has a subliminal, implicit theme. The theme of noticing, recognizing, and interpreting clues, signs, omens, apparent coincidences, and miraculous happenings and their significances in the choices you then make.There are two distinct, divergent views (and type of persons) on the occurrence of inter-connected events in the world. The first or traditional view is that apart from the mundane, any strange or unusual or inter-connected events are due to super-natural connected causes or divine intervention, and the other is the modern scientific-atheist view that these are merely coincidences, chance, or accidental events and only mistakenly appear to be strangely connected only because they are extremely improbable. According to this latter view, given enough time, even a monkey with a typewriter can eventually produce a Shakespearean tragedy, just as a few basic elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc., given enough time and all the right conditions (near impossibility), will eventually come together to form a highly complex living organism like a bacteria out of sheer chance...by now you get the picture.In this movie, Jules who is one of the key characters is of the first type, and his partner Vincent is not exactly of the second type but rather the type who doesn't give a damn either way – the kind that never reflects upon any happening. When the 'miracle' happens, Jules immediately recognizes it, whereas Vincent couldn't care less, and so Jules knows that this sign, the omen, the extremely unlikely happening is of direct significance for him and him alone and immediately decides to make a choice – to make a U-turn in his life of crime. That decision empowers him, and when he comes to face another event where he has the choice either to kill or not to kill – he makes the right one.Jules stands redeemed and empowered, but Vincent has learned nothing and meets his fate as a man would who has lived his life 'unconsciously'. Samuel Jackson as Jules stands out as the most intense actor and delivers his lines as a champion boxer going for the knockout punch. The others are really peripheral characters – the ones who fill in the scene to make it more colorful.If this movie makes you more conscious of the unusual happenings in your life and then correctly derive their significance effectively for yourself, rather than dismiss the whole 'miracle of life' as mere chance coincidences, you will have got the message of this film, otherwise its good entertainment only."
7 June 2021,hebsi-71285,3,8,6,Did not enjoy it,I watched it for the first time in 2021. I did not like it maybe back then was big hit.
1 July 2004,thet4xm4n,4,7,10,Pure movie-going bliss.,"This movie is just the best there is. It is one of, if not, my favorite film of all time. It is easily Tarantino's best, not only because of his great style and visible love of movies, made evidence in this film, or for his pop culture icons plastered throughout his films. It isn't great because of only one of these things, but they all contribute to the quirkiness and coolness of the film. Not one moment of the film is wasted, everything contributes to it. The silences and pauses are just perfect, the dialogue is just long enough to make you think about how much time is being spent on a certain conversation, but not too long as to seem to try too hard, like so many other films have since Pulp Fiction. This movie is far from an action movie, and it is not a comedy, despite it being quite hilarious throughout. It is a twisted, unorthodox, and overall wonderfully directed and edited piece of filmaking that makes great use of its seemingly trivial parts as almost the main focus of the film, and uses these things to enhance the characters and the storyline. Each character gets his or her time to shine without it seeming like the film is making room for this, as Tarantino just tells each one's story in his amazing way, taking all of his perfectly orchestrated pieces, and putting them all together in the end..."
1 September 2010,kimdino-1,1,2,8,Don't prejudge - I did and found I was wrong,"I must start by saying that I am NOT a fan of Tarantino. I have seen a couple of his other films and thought, to be blunt, they were absolute crap. From them I gained the impression that his films were no more than violence, blood & gore thinly disguised by a weak plot and/or pretentious artiness. I had no plans to see 'Pulp Fiction' and would have avoided it.I know there are many others who feel the same and if you are one of these then put aside your feelings and give 'Pulp Fiction' a go. I only watched it because someone who knew my thoughts and this film kept on at me to see it. I am very glad he did.The violence is there but is far from excessive. What really is there is a great storyline with some good interwoven plot lines and many chuckles. Very well directed and acted. Enough to make for a very enjoyable 2-1/2 hours.So don't let 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Kill Bill' etc put you off. 'Pulp Fiction' is a damn good movie well worth seeing."
9 October 1998,JT-27,1,1,10,What 'cho takin' 'bout Vincent,"Absolutly the best film I've seen in my 17 years.  I'm studying to be a filmmaker and if Tarantino's work, even though some isn't as original as others, doesn't inspire you in one way or another, you obviously don't see the artistic achievement this young brilliant director has bestowed upon us. In my book, the man can do no wrong."
11 February 2021,jackpatrick-65727,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction is a MASTERPIECE!,"Wow, I'm blown away by how fantastic this movie is. This movie has an incredible cast!! John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are perfect as Vincent and Jules, and the rest of the cast are spectacular!! It's so humorous at times, and it always lands. I liked the different stories involved in the film, and how they all tie back together. This movie does have some messed up stuff, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PULP FICTION SO MUCH!!! Now Pulp Fiction's one of my favorite films of all time, because Tarantino's a genius, and he's one of the best directors of all time!!!"
10 May 2010,stasia_stasia,1,2,8,Pulp Fiction '94,"Quentin Tarantino has done it again! He has yet again made another fantastic movie. Pulp Fiction has everything in it to make it awesome. From the directing to the acting to the plot line and everything in between. Pulp Fiction has some of the best actors and actresses money can buy. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, and Uma Thurman, are just some of the huge cast; together they make a great team to make this film what it is today. The main reason to why I personally think this film is amazing is the way it was directed by Tarantino. This isn't just a regular film, where the story line starts from the beginning to ending. Pulp Fiction is a jumbled up mess, as if someone took the script and switched the pages. But that is what makes this film unique and memorable. It takes a couple times to watch the film, or just once, while really paying attention, to really understand what is going on, with all the subplots and characters. Filled with comedy, drama, and memorable quotes, and characters is just fantastic. A must see movie for any film lover."
11 May 2021,keyvanyar,2,5,7,Over rated,"In my opinion this movie is a little over rated although I know it is for 90's and for those days, The cast is really powerful."
7 May 2020,otherjobstodo,3,12,1,I disagree to call this a masterpiece.,I watched it. And I am not getting the answer how come this has been rated rated this much? And the most surprising fact is it holds so many votes!
9 June 2014,nataliegal,4,6,10,Art in the film form,"The most fantastic movie I've seen, its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now. A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art. I have watched this movie tons of times, and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant. Also ""Reservoir of Dogs"" is very recommended. One of my most favorite movies of all. I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasn't yet trashed Hollywood. Have Fun watching and Happy Journey!"
13 February 2021,abdouaouich,1,1,8,Enjoyable meal,"Great art. Perhaps the best film of the Great Tarantino. It's not my kind of movie (for that 8/10) but Pulp Fiction is a great success. A very original and catchy story, a royal cast (Bruce Wills, Uma Thurman, John Travolta ...), good music, an excellent script, worked dialogues ... In short, film to see absolutely."
22 October 2015,JamesW1967,6,9,9,Inglourious Pulp Fiction,"Inspired by true events, a true story, masterful, twisted and bent Quentin Tarantino with a crowd of brilliant talent that destroys essential life to promote egotistic nepotism; in short stunning and sensational. Pulp Fiction has a timeless addiction that pervades the veins and makes the heartbeat faster... Why 9? Whine and wine again... there's something special about being inglorious... and years later Quentin is still pumping the fiction and mashing the pulp. This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system. How can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."
10 June 2022,Dolchi,1,3,10,Tarantino at his finest,"This film is a pure visual treat for all Tarantino fans and shows great creativity in every twist involved.As many people know, Tarantino is a master of making engaging films with painting like frames and deep dialogues that contribute to building a lot of content.The film mesmerises with the choice of background music chosen by the director as well. We can safely say that any movie buff will enjoy this film."
12 June 2019,rassezeus,1,2,10,One of the best movies of all time!,"Pulp Fiction was my first Tarantino I ever saw and was instantly hooked to them. The ""reverse"" storytelling, use of language and the extreme (altought sometimes meaby overusage) of violence made me a huge Tarantino fan.Pulp Fiction has everything that a crime/drama movie needs. Interesting characters, different settings and very VERY hooking story.I highly recommend you to watch this movie!"

You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie, you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion, This is the Best movie John Travolta & Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie, is that you may THINK, that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me, you don't have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more, without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10..If you haven't seen it, go get a copy immediately.."
19 January 2005,Robert_90,1,2,9,"A great movie, even though I don't like it.","Pulp Fiction has essentially defined the indie movie. I first saw it on TV some time last year and have since put it on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list.Odd, that. Even though everybody seems to like the movie, to me there isn't that much to like about it.The dialogue is supposedly just ordinary chit-chat that people may have on a daily basis, but it's like that in that for the most part the dialogue is actually a sort of boring idle chat while you wait for the interesting bits. The parts of dialogue I think of in particular involve the whole chat between Vincent and Jules between the end of the opening credits and reaching the dudes' apartment (you know, about foot massages and the boss's wife etc). The same goes for much of the conversation during the Vincent-Mia ""date"", the conversation between Butch and his girlfriend, etc. Royale with cheese is interesting the first time but after about the 5th time I lost interest.Also there's the characters - Jules is supposedly one of the coolest characters in modern cinema but what's to like? He's just a black guy in a black suit who quotes the Bible and uses ""the m/f-word"" a lot. Even his redemption doesn't quite interest me so much. Likewise, the vast majority of the characters are unlikeable on some level - Vincent is a drug user who makes several bad mistakes over the course of the film (you know what I mean), Mia is a lower-class coke addict with a sugar daddy and a failed TV pilot to her name and there's nothing likable at all about Butch. The only character I really liked was the Wolf, because he just had that smooth confidence and sharp mind that seems to come alive when Harvey Keitel plays a character.As for the story  out of all three stories (the ""date"", the ""gold watch"" and the ""Bonnie situation""), my favourite had to be ""the Bonnie situation"" because it just worked. From the unexpected ""trigger"" of events, this is quite interesting because it focuses on Jules for the most part as he undergoes his ""moment of clarity"", plus watching the two cleaning up is a laugh and a half. The other stories have their interesting moments (""bring out the Gimp"") but are nowhere near as interesting because the idea is that the characters speak more often than any action happens. Oh well, such is life.The action itself is actually clichés, but done in such a way that they seem original. The examples include the assassination sequence, the car crash, etc. The one piece of action that seemed incredibly original was the entire hillbilly sex dungeon scene  probably one of the best scenes in the movie, if somewhat disturbing.In short, this is a good movie though. It's good for those of you who like ""talkies"" punctuated with action i.e. most people, but I seriously can't understand why this ends up on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list. Maybe it's because this movie is, among other things, bi-polar.I give it 7/10"

                        ",My Pulp Fiction,"My parents would always talk about this particular film as if it was something religious. Not just them, but other elderly people I know. Finally sitting down and watching the film, it's easy to see why they did that! Tarantino, CLEARLY, has been a genius since the 1990's. This movie is overwhelmingly powerful. Something I'll watch again. Not only did they have some amazing actors, but the whole plot was something to consider! Thee Crime/Thriller genre is something that interests me, so watching this was a breeze. The fact that it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole entire movie also had me consider its ranking in great movies. This is definitely a movie to get wrapped up in."
25 July 2004,daria84,1,3,10,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"Well I just saw Kill Bill, and I became a big Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman fan.  So I heard a lot about this movie, and I bought it.. at first I didn't get it very well because I had no idea what it was about, I never heard about the plot or anything, (yeah, this movie is like 10 years old and I saw it a couple of weeks ago).  Anyways I was so glad I bought it! I even bought the soundtrack, it's just so good!  it's amazing how Quentin Tarantino has a natural skill to tell a story that, if someone else would have told it, it would be dead boring or just stupid..  I noticed that in both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, all the dialogues are absolutely necessaries!  You won't see stupid phrases like in horror movies when the killer is approaching and they say ""ruuuun!"" d'oh! of course u have to run, there's no need to say it!!-  here, if you take away one single dialogue, the whole thing falls apart.So the casting is perfect, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc... they were all great, the careers of all these actors turned to a different direction after this movie, for good of course, for all of them (especially Travolta who was dead for Hollywood and thanks to this movie he's still around).  Also Harvey Keitel, even his character didn't have a lot of screentime, he did great, he's my favorite. 
Well the music is perfect, it fits every single scene (special mention to that song ""you'll be a woman soon""), etc...  Well it's a great movie, and it's definitely right to be #16 in the list and no wonder why it won the best picture at the Cannes festival back in 1994, TWO THUMBS WAAAY UP!"
23 April 2020,s-16730,1,1,10,A classic forever,"In my opinion, the greatest movie of all time. It makes people laugh and keeps them engaged at the same time.

14 April 2021,Ashrith26,1,1,9,It isn't just a movie. It's a genre.,"Before I've watched this movie , I thought it was overrated. Well, by no means it is overrated. No one could ever match the Tarantino's screenplay in this movie. It hasn't got any bold story(which makes it better, to be honest) and a non linear timeline which is constructed very beautifully.It is great,magnificent and got all the characteristics of a great movie: great acting, good narration, and screenplay afterall is it's biggest strength.You can't even imagine anyone other than samuel Jackson and John Travolta in their roles. Two gangsters of their own style, who talk about what's a big mac called In other countries,talking about movies, and everything except a murder during a murder. The world and characters in pulp fiction are way different, no one feels guilty or sorry towards a crime and we'll get along with it too. This aspect was portrayed very smoothly.As I already said pulp fiction is a genre in itself. It has inspired a lot of moviemakers around the world and I was shocked by knowing that this is Tarantino's second movie only.no one can match this masterpiece."

11 May 2010,alooftrashman,1,2,10,Tarantino in His Prime,"A film for most modern movie fans that needs no introduction. Quentin Tarantino's ode to the 50s noir mystery and about a dozen other film genres, but that's Tarantino's bread and butter.You've got excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman, just to name a few. You've got hilarious dialog (Why can't you just hit the guy?) and an abstract story structure that will most likely have you confused til the very end. Not to mention samurai swords and a gimp! What's so great about Tarantino movies is that they very much resemble modern art. What I mean by that is you watch them, and you're never entirely sure what you're watching, but by the film's end, you're left with a sense of completion and totality that you rarely get in any other cinematic experience. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You can thank me later."
25 January 2021,rutujwaghmare-41601,1,1,10,Tarantino's best work,"In a diner, a man and a woman who call each other Pumpkin and Honey Bunny eat breakfast in a booth. Honey Bunny teases Pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and Pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. She agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll.Across town, two men in suits named Vincent and Jules ride in a car discussing Europe and fast food. Jules tells Vincent that Marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife Mia's feet, who Vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. They argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. Jules kills one, and recites Ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named Brett. Vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet.In a bar, Marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named Butch, bribing him to throw his next match. Vincent and Jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and Butch has a brief exchange with Vincent on his way out.
In the following scene, Vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named Lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend Jody. After buying three grams of heroin, Vincent shoots up and heads to Mia's house. Mia does cocaine in the bathroom while Vincent fixes himself a drink. They head to a restaurant named Jackrabbit Slim's, where they talk about Mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which Mia denies. Mia forces Vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win.Back at Mia's house, while Vincent uses the bathroom, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. A panicked Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, although Lance is reluctant to help. Vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. At the end of the night, Mia tells Vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret.A man named Captain Koons visits Butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. As an adult, Butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as Marsellus wanted. Butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named Esmeralda, and calls a bookie named Scottie who plans to collect Butch's earnings. Meanwhile, Marsellus orders that Butch be killed. At a nearby motel, Butch's girlfriend Fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. The next morning, Butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it.Butch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. He retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. He hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be Vincent. Butch leaves and is spotted by Marsellus at a stoplight. Butch rams him with his car, and an injured Marsellus chases an injured Butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named Maynard.Butch and Marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where Maynard has bound and gagged them. A man named Zed shows up, who orders Maynard to get ""the Gimp,"" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. Zed drags Marsellus into another room to be raped while Maynard watches, and Butch manages to break free. Butch is about to flee when he hears Marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing Maynard. Now freed, Marsellus shoots Zed in the crotch, and tells Butch that the men are even, as long as Butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. Butch rides Zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and Fabienne ride away together.The film flashes back to the scene where Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. After Jules kills Brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing Jules and Vincent with his entire clip. Jules and Vincent kill him, and Jules calls the event an act of ""divine intervention."" The two take Marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. In the car, the men continue debating ""divine intervention,"" and Jules pledges to give up his life of crime. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him. Jules calls a nearby friend named Jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup.
At Jimmie's house, Jules calls Marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named Winston Wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. Jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife Bonnie arrives home. Wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs Jules and Vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. They place Jimmie's blankets over the seat, and Wolfe hoses a naked Jules and Vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. They follow Wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. Wolfe introduces Jules and Vincent to his girlfriend Raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves.Jules and Vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are about to rob in the first scene. Vincent goes to the bathroom just before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny draw their guns. When Pumpkin demands Jules's wallet and the briefcase, Jules draws his weapon, and explains to Pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of Ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. Vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Jules successfully de-escalates the situation, and he and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand."
13 December 2020,timmyminh,1,2,8,An Overrated Awesome Movie,"Now I know when you read the title of my review you may think it's such an oxymoron but it's exactly what it says: Pulp Fiction is a awesome and brilliant and smart film but it's overrated. People like to toss the word ""overrated"" as if it's a synonym for ""bad"" but it just means something is being valued more than it should be. In other words, I don't think Pulp Fiction is 8.9 great but like an 8.1-8.3 kind of great.Pulp Fiction with its witty dialogues, non-linear structure of storytelling, entertaining moments and characters, subtle details in screenwriting are not enough to convince me that it is 8.9 good. And I've watched and studied this film as much angles and layers as a film student could and still fail to see why it is 8.9 and is on par with The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, 12 Angry Men, Schindler's List, and The Dark Knight - all of which are titanic achievements in cinema.But don't let those dilute you to think I think this film sucks, like I said it deserves probably 8.1 to 8.3 at the most. So I will lay out why I think Pulp Fiction is still great.The witty dialogues: Quentin Tarantino easily stands among legendary screenwriters such as Aaron Sorkin, Eric Roth, Tom McCarthy, etc. in terms of dialogue writings. They are smart, entertaining, engaging. How Tarantino wrote the diner scene where Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace was spending an entire minute of screen time ordering the food and still keep the audience intrigued: this is because he uses exotic terms for the food and uses the character's reaction to those exotic names. That's how to make it interesting.Furthermore, it adds such smart details into the plot for example the fact that Butch and Marsellus spent minutes agreeing that Butch should throw his fight only to be sabotaged in under 30 seconds after Butch interacts with Vincent Vega. Vince calling Butch a ""palooka"" and ""punchy"" (both are affronts to a boxer, more than that, a person with a warrior complex like Butch), then Butch sees that Vince and Marsellus are good friends hugging each other. This crucial 30 seconds change the plot forever, causing Butch to not throw the fight and the lives of him, Marsellus, and Vincent Vega to be subsequently changed forever. This was such smart writing.Of course, the entertainment in this film is such thrilling: the OD of Mia Wallace and the anticipation on whether the situation can be salvaged; the rape scene and how our characters overcome that in a satisfying way; Samuel Jackson's character Jules' wittily intimidating lowkey comedic dialogues.and the diner robbery then the showdown between Pumpkin and Jules is such breathtaking. Then of course, the iconic Pulp Fiction dance, what can I say?Pulp Fiction's message hidden in hindsight is ultimately that of redemption or choosing the right path for life. For Mia Wallace, she chose the druggie life only to be end up on the verge of death, after the morbid experience we can see her soften somehow. Maybe then she will turn to righteousness and redemption. Next, Butch's family background were all warriors which is why he chooses to be a boxer but then the warrior element doesn't come in until he made decision on whether to save Marsellus Wallace his enemy or not from the degenerate hillbillies. Which is why he chose a Samurai sword out of all things. Finally, Jules' arc is that he realizes he only survive an ordeal through ""divine intervention"" and deliberate that this is a sign and if he doesn't stop being a proxy in this business now then more a dire fate may ensue upon him. Hence why he shows mercy to Pumpkin a diner robber and he rethinks the interpretation of his Bible verse.Overall, we can see the source for a person's switch to righteousness doesn't just come from religion (which is what most people think because they only focus on Jules' arc), but it comes from many things: a brush with mortality (Mia Wallace), family values (Butch), salvation from a foe (Marsellus Wallace), and faith (Jules). The only character who was not enlighten to this revelation was Vincent Vega because his lifestyle is too deeply embedded in this criminal and toxic underworld. Furthermore, he's too absent-minded and too shallow to comprehend a deeper deliberation in life as Jules. Hence why he does not buy into Jules' interpretation of divine intervention.The dialogue writting of Tarantino is just like his plot writing: it starts with one point then spirals into a whole different place in a way that is entertaining. This is because real life dialogues and real life events are exactly the same. This is why Tarantino's writing is so great. And overall, Pulp Fiction is great is awesome is smart and easily win a place in my top 30. But of course, as I said, I still don't get and probably never will understand why it is 8.9 and is top 6 of the best film ever made despite of how much I said I love it above and the many explanations and readings of this film that I have read."
7 March 2021,obiethereal,1,1,9,Dialogue Kings,"The first movie to introduce me to the world of writing good dialogue and using the camera as a character. Learned so much about pacing, music and humor from this one!"
8 April 2002,kleaner,1,2,10,the movie that started all,"After this film, every movie that tries anything unique gets the nick name of ""Post Tarantino"".  Diarrangement of time, sudden brutal violence, oldie soundtrack, and the funny moments of the situation...Tarantino invented none of these but now any of those has his brand on it. Beside the time disarrangement, the movie itself is so fun to watch. When filmmakers make ganster films, they must suffer a lot because Tarantino has achieved so widely in this film."
6 July 2013,LeonLouisRicci,0,3,9,Fresh and Flavorful,"Influential and inventive this was so fresh and new in Style that it caught Viewers and Critics off guard and aghast and they hardly knew what to say. That never could be said about the Maverick Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino.His Films, to this day, are driven by words. His dialog flows fluently and without restraint dominating Scenes creating sometimes unbearable Suspense that usually leads to Violent eruptions of varying degree.This, his second Feature, is not without moments of self-indulgence that threaten to bore or at the very least are unnecessary. The Wordsmith sometimes is guilty of just a bit too much Ego. Here there are scenes that are clunky, embarrassing, and absolutely could be excised without loss.The bedroom scene with Bruce Willis and Friend comes to mind. The final third of the Bondage/Rape Scene just talks way too long. The watch as heirloom Scene with the young Butch is clunky. The Director's Cameo as Jimmy is quite bad and reeks of overWriting (gourmet coffee), and bad Acting. Maybe a few others. But these are minor extensions of good Scenes that are to be critical, bloated.But that hardly keeps this from being an exercise in Style and a completely New Wave of making Movies. It is sharp and serpentine, colorful and Cool. There is a youthful, playful energy that was lacking at the time in Filmmaking that was forever stimulated and forced on to a new path of Artistic Angst. For that this will be remembered as not just a Fad, but put a new Face on Film that is needed now and then to shake things up."
15 September 2007,Doylenf,0,2,7,Darkly humorous tale laced with profanity and corruption...,"PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. All of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the ""f"" word and the ""n"" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. There is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work.Tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. It's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time.The dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the Bible readings that SAMUEL L. JACKSON quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner.UMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA. The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like Marilyn Monroe, Ed Sullivan and Mamie Van Doren doing their stuff while platters are served. They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.It's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a ""cleaner-upper"" who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. His brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. They don't call this ""pulp fiction"" for nothing!! Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.Summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released."
8 October 2015,view_and_review,0,2,8,Sam Jackson Steals the Show,"One of the great things about re-watching a movie is catching some of the things you never noticed the first time. There were two little nuggets I found the second time around. 1.) I had no idea Steve Buscemi was in the movie. He had a tiny tiny role as the Buddy Holiday server at the restaurant. Only because I've seen him in so much since then was I able to recognize him in Pulp Fiction. 2.) Samuel L. Jackson was a riot! He was chock full of funny lines and zingers, and even the way he delivered them... priceless.If you haven't seen Pulp Fiction before then it may be a little confusing the first time you watch. I know I was confused. The main characters stay the same throughout the movie but Tarantino jumbles their little individual stories so that the order of the movie isn't chronological. It is no real hindrance to watching the movie it just makes you pay attention more.The movie is good as the IMDb rating will tell you. For my money, the Samuel Jackson scenes were all I needed."
17 February 2003,JohnLennon1985,1,3,10,Royale with cheese.,"Pulp Fiction was an excellent movie. Quentin Tarantino showed us filmmaking at its best. Well-written, well-acted, well-executed. Story: 10/10. We're watching several stories at the same time, and in one way or another, they're connected. I can't say too much without spoiling it, so I won't.Characters: 10/10. The characters are so diverse, yet they fit into place.Acting: 10/10. With talent like Tim Roth, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman (and Phil LaMarr), do I really have to go into detail?Execution: 10/10. As said before, Pulp Fiction is filmmaking at its best.Pulp Fiction was great. There's really no reason to explain it. It just is. Hands down. Final Score: 10/10."
1 May 2013,LizNaylor,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is phenomenal on so many different levels. Quentin Tarantino is a truly talented director that goes to no end to make his films powerful beyond belief. Pulp Fiction is just one example of the many great ones. The moment you turn on Pulp Fiction, you know you're in for quite a ride. This film has all the necessary components to make it exciting, gangsters, fights, drug conflicts, etc. This movie is so mind bending because of all the twists and turns and chapters it takes you on. To say this movie is complicated would be an understatement, but when you're finished watching it, you are left sitting there thinking how amazing it actually is. Thurman, Travolta, and Jackson are just a few names whose acting make this movie what it is. You haven't seen a great movie until you've watched Pulp Fiction."
19 April 2022,sallyeccles,2,3,10,I'm no film buff,"Im no film buff, Im not a media student or a person that's able to watch a film and have any clue what goes on behind the scenes and what needs to happen pre production to make a film pop, but sweet holy Mary! I have never watched a film like this before and I am simply spellbound. What a cultural reset this must have been for film making. Tarantino shines too bright for this world man!"
3 April 2014,Wuchakk,0,2,9,The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers,"RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).The lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.I put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let 'em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God's grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn't and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.Both Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with ""Pulp Fiction."" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Roger Avary.GRADE: A"
17 March 2022,KoredeSam,1,1,10,Didn't watch until very recently,"I really enjoyed it, even though I did not watch the film until recently, I enjoyed watching it! It was a cool action packed film from the 80s.I only heard about it recently from a friend that kept repeating a quote from the movie, we were in French class so you can guess the quote lol."
21 July 2021,chefseanaz,1,2,10,One of the greatest films of all time.,"If you haven't seen this, you've been living on the outskirts of society with no TV for 30 years. It's a quintessential film to watch. They don't make movies as good as this anymore. Cinematography,screenwriting,dialogue, cannot be beat."
19 February 2001,mm-39,0,2,9,Film of the 90's,"This director peaked when he made this film, I do not think he will ever be able to out do Pulp Fiction.  This films timing, cast, and story mixed perfectly, like a good meal.  It is a combination of talent and luck to make a film like this.      The timing is incredible, for it was released in the mid 90's during the hight of political correctness.  Harrison Ford could not pick up a gun in the movie clear and present danger.  Swearing, any bad stereo types of characters was tabu.  The film industry was getting very boring, and this shocker came out.  I was surprise there was no protests over this film.  The swearing, racial slears, violence, drug use, and rape pushed this film to new lows.  This film is well made not from cheap shock value. The shock value is a by-product of the sleazy characters.     It is the scripts characters and the story make this film mind blowing, and fresh.  The acting is incredibly strong, no one could a ford this cast now, because all the actors where either up and coming or over the hill during this film, and luckly instead of watching a actor get paid 20 million and the film suffers, we see a very strong cast.  The 4 stories all melt into one, and the films message is about choices in life, along with a anti violent message.  Unlike many movies of that time it does not preach this message, which insults the viewer, but brilliantly makes a subtle message."
29 December 1999,Nick S,1,2,10,Definately one of the best ever,"Pulp Fiction is movie making at its finest. From the terrific acting (esp. Samuel), the witty script, and the best soundtrack in a movie, its got it all. Tarantino's best. His let down was Jackie Brown. I hope that he can try a different style of film next time. But that aside this is definately one of the greatest of all time. Easily a 10/10"
17 June 2022,Spencer-Walsh,1,1,9,Pulp Fiction is a movie that needs no introduction.,"Of course, in writing this entry I'm assuming that most of you have seen the movie Pulp Fiction, or at least know what it is. If you've never heard of Tarantino's 1994 masterpiece for some reason, I'd encourage you to give it a watch as soon as time permits. And when you do, think back on this entry and see if you can spot all forty-four uses of pop culture references in Pulp Fiction. Granted, it's not exactly a perfect movie (I'm looking at you, Smoky), but there's no denying its influence on pop culture today. It doesn't surprise me that Tarantino keeps coming up with memorable lines for his movies; after all, he got his start writing dialogue for video games. But I digress. If there's ever been a movie that heavily relies on dialogue and pop culture references to engage the audience, it's definitely Pulp Fiction. So if you do decide to watch it some time soon, be sure to look out for number forty-five."
21 August 2019,christopher-underwood,0,3,9,more humour (just) and more cute dialogue than in the latest film,"I was prompted to watch this again after seeing the director's latest, Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Clearly this earlier film was more innovative and likely more influential than the later film will prove to be. I find Once Upon A Time a more enjoyable watch but the significance and importance of this is undeniable. Twenty-five years on and the groundbreaking affect it has had on Hollywood makes it easy to forget just how revolutionary this street talking, time lapsing, audacious film was. Everyone is great, even Tim Roth and Jackson, Keitel, Willis, Travolta and Thurman all excel. All the scenes, effectively split and mixed are good and the diner bookends a genius idea. There is more humour (just) and more cute dialogue than in the latest film but for me this is, inevitably, a slightly less mature work with the fantastic editing covering the odd rough spot."
20 November 2006,Sylviastel,0,2,8,First Rate Cast but silly plot!,"I don't get this film and why it's so great according to Siskel and Ebert or other critics. Maybe it's the style of filming that is both experimental and groundbreaking, all I found was that there was so much cursing and swearing and a weak plot. I love the scene where John Travolta dances with Uma Thurman. It's silly but memorable, probably the most memorable scene from the film. I think the film is disappointing because I preferred the spoofs from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV versions. This film is completely about life in Los Angeles. I liked the interaction between the two hit men played by Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters. It seemed to be real. I don't understand the diner experience. I thought it was out of place. I think I have to watch it again and again to finally get it."
10 November 2002,lazhuward,3,6,8,"Good (maybe great) film, but not a masterpiece.","When Pulp Fiction first came out, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made and was sure that it would become a classic. Earlier today though, I saw it again after not viewing it for several years and my opinion of it is now a bit lower.It's still a good movie and there are aspects of it that are certainly great. The plot is well constructed and the story lines are compelling. There are a variety of interesting characters and many humorous and dramatic scenes. Several actors (who were at their peak at the time) have juicy roles and give excellent performances: Uma Thurman, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken. Overall, the movie is unbelievably entertaining.After seeing Pulp Fiction again though, with several more years of movie viewing experience now under my belt, parts of it look amateurish. The shots don't always work; composition is bad, stuff is out of focus, lighting is bad. Although the banal conversations are fantastic, the dialogue doesn't work all the time either, particularly for Samuel L. Jackson's character. When I listened to him, I couldn't help but think that this is how a white dude thinks a black gangster should talk. There are also a ton of obvious continuity and factual errors in the film that are distracting (check the ""Goofs for Pulp Fiction"" page here at IMDB for an incomplete listing of them). In most movies, I don't notice these kinds of errors because they're so subtle, but in Pulp Fiction they're glaring.Pulp Fiction is still cool and enjoyable, but it seems like I can look at it in a more critical light now. It's been almost ten years since it was made and the hype is finally starting to die down. It's a good (maybe great) film, but it's not a classic or a masterpiece."
18 January 2016,nhare-2,8,25,1,What a load of pulp,"I tried to watch this for the 4th time. I didn't fall asleep this time. Maybe its just because its American, but I couldn't understand and F@#king word that they said, apart from ""F@#K"".Maybe there was a story there, but I just didn't get it.It wasn't the most boring movie I have ever seen. That honour still goes to: The Big Chill, fell asleep 7 times trying to watch that.Full of big names, and that was it. No substance too it at all.It looks like it was a high school media-arts project.I cannot understand why this movie wasn't panned by the critics. In my opinion, this is worth airtime, let alone my time to watch it.Flush it down the Dunne with the rest of the pulp."
13 October 1998,bungle-2,4,13,5,Shallow grave,"Pulp Fiction is a smooth, well-made and extremely shallow piece of work. It is basically a kind of black comedy about unsympathetic murderers who walk around in L.A. talking about foot-massage and $5-milk-shake. It gets boring after 10 minutes. But in the name of justice, I guess I should mention that I used to be quite fond of this movie. The thing is that I watched it on television yesterday, and I realized that the whole movie is utterly superficial. There is absolutely nothing more to it than meets the eye. That makes it quite fun to watch for the first time, but after a while you get to know all the phrases and ""cool"" set-pieces, and you start looking for something more, something ""deeper"". But there isn´t. Pulp Fiction is only four years old, but it has already started fading dramatically."
18 August 2002,Gorilla Punk,1,2,10,The best movie of all time!,"This movie is absolutely original and hilarious!  The action is cutting edge, from Mia's overdose scene to Marcellus in the pawn shop.  Best of all, the dialogue is unforgettable!  Ezekiel 25:17 and Quarter Pounders in Paris will be discussion topics for years to come.
This is my favorite movie.  On a scale of 1 - 10, I give it a 20."
1 August 2003,sausagebrigade,1,2,8,"A great movie, but a little bit annoying...","First things first, I hate Tarantino's dialogue. People don't talk like that. They don't reference obscure movies or recite Bible passages. Although I guess Tarantino's people aren't like others...another problem is the surf music soundtrack. It gets irritating after a while. But everything else is fine, particularly Harvey Keitel's slick performance, the interweaving of the three stories, and the alternately stylish and brutal visuals. This is arguably Tarantino's most over-indulgent movie though, so check out Jackie Brown for something a little less silly."
30 March 2019,gbill-74877,0,2,10,Masterpiece,"What an absolute blast and wild ride this film is. Everything about it screams joy and having fun at the movie theater. The cast is extraordinary, my god. Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Rhames, Willis, Keitel, Stoltz, Arquette, Walken, Roth, Plummer, de Medeiros ... that's 12 fantastic actors playing 12 fantastic characters. If you think about it, each of them is given a moment to absolutely shine, and they literally all come through. The script is brilliant, with dialogue that crackles between philosophy, wry observations, and street talk that is as hilarious as it is earthy. There are so many great scenes, and you can just feel Tarantino reveling in the film's campiness, its soundtrack, and its (many) surprise moments. I also love how he told the story out of order, in a very creative way. Brilliant."
15 July 2021,kevin_robbins,0,1,10,This an all time great American film,"Pulp Fiction (1994) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a series of characters within the same circles whose worlds are about to collide. We follow two hitmen running errands for a gangster of sorts. That said gangster has a fix in with an aging boxer who has plans of his own. We also see a desperate couple looking for efficient ways to make money...like robbing restaurants. This movie is directed by Quintin Tarantino (Django) and stars John Travolta (Grease), Samuel L. Jackson (Do the Right Thing), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill), Ving Rhames (Mission Impossible), Bruce Willis (Die Hard) and Tim Roth (The Hateful Eight). The storyline for this picture is magnificent, intricate and well written in every way. The dialogue is so clever and witty. The acting is out of this world and every character is believable and mesmerizing. The cast truly couldn't have been better selected. The situations are so random and well portrayed. The cinematography, camera angles, colors and settings are all perfect. There's nothing I would change about this movie and would easily score this a 10/10 and call this an all time great American film."
30 December 2019,ups-36964,2,12,3,Overrated as hell,"This movie is certainly one of the most over hyped movie i've ever seen. It has nothing orignal. It is copied from the western action movies from 60s and 70s. And people are praising Tarantino, calling him genius. Well, he certainly reincarnated the genre, but he hasn't done anything creative except for the bible reference. So, where is the imagination?.What are the people getting excited for?Now, talking about the story, it doesn't have one. Yes it has 3. These three short stories are somewhat connected to each other by a character named Marsellus Wallace, whom you can call the villain of the movie. But the problem is that neither these stories are interesting nor they create any surprise when they meet. Though I liked the one that features Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. These too literally nailed their role. I enjoyed their chemistry very much. Especially Samuel L Jackson has done a natural act. Other than that, there's nothing except for violence, gore (Tbh I like them, but here it was not satisfactory) and biblical refrences. Also it really hurts that a great movie THE SHAWSANK REDEMPTION lost to this one at the box office. It is really shameful. Biblical references are also there in TSR and they are for a reason.Anyways, if you want to waste two and half hours of your life just for watching some stupid philosophical action movie, then watch it.."
17 July 2008,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,0,4,10,A genuine work of genius that changed the face of film-making,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Lovers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) exchange some dialogue in an American diner before taking their guns out and holding the place up, the latest in a long line of hold ups. Meanwhile, contract killers Vince (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L Jackson) also share some clever observations on life, travelling in their car before taking care of two lowlives who have crossed paths with their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) who at the same time is in his club, persuading down on his luck boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to throw a fight for him. However, Butch suicidally has other ideas on his mind. In the space of a day, these characters will be drawn together and their fates decided by each other in some way none of them saw coming.In 1991, the world first experienced the genius of Tarantino with his excellent debut feature Reservoir Dogs. But the clever concept and genius writing were over-shadowed by controversy, with the inclusion of a certain scene involving an ear. It says a lot that by the time Pulp Fiction came out, RD was still banned on video. Although it's not zoomed in on quite as much, there's a similarly unpleasant bit in here involving a hillbilly corrupt police officer with a twisted anal perversion, which shows the sickness in the director's mind he is unable to let go of. But, as shocking as these scenes are in each respective film, it's a wonder if all the hoohah they caused was worth it for Tarantino, as his skill as a screen writer and story teller was surely enough to get him by without these nasty inclusions. But they add to the film like everything else and the sickness is as uniquely Tarantino as, well, everything else.This is simply a film by which any others can be compared. It revolutionized film-making in a way no one saw coming, with the delivery of the story and the effortlessly cool dialogue, which had many pretenders to the throne copying it's style long afterward. But the film is simply one in a million, told in a way only Tarantino could have done and as outrageous as only he could be.It also succeeds in having a great cast playing brilliant characters. Travolta, an actor who had been languishing in the wilderness for years (a trait Tarantino would employ for many other long forgotten stars in years to come) and Jackson, who late in his life and career went on to become quite the mega-star for his inclusion in the film, are unforgettable as the ultra savvy, cool, assured hit men forced to lose their trendy suits and look like average surfer dudes by the end of the film. Also, Roth, a British actor whose career was pretty much launched by this, got his shot at the big time here and gave it his all along with character actress Plummer as his trigger happy lover. Willis and Rhames also make memorable roles out of their characters, along with supporting turns from the likes of Uma Thurman as Wallace's coked up failed actress wife and Harvey Keitel as the conspicuous (but bad mannered) 'cleaner' sent to sort out an unfortunate mess Travolta and Jackson get themselves into.A mind blowingly clever and inventive tale, cool, stylish, outrageous and carried along by a savvy soundtrack, including such 70s hits as Let's Stay Together and Son of a Preacher Man, this is simply an unforgettable masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Push comes to shove, I probably preferred Reservoir Dogs but this certainly ain't lagging too far behind it. *****"
11 May 2013,RoseXGold,1,2,9,Classic!,This movie has so much substance to it( literally)! The music in this film is amazing. There is definitely a modern feel to it. The fact that the film reaches out to so many different types of people is astounding. Being able to relate to a film is one of the very most important ingredients when it comes to film making. I loved the rawness of the directing and producing. This film did a great job at capturing the lifestyle and works of this time period. The costumes took the film to the next level. The actors portrayed their characters amazingly. Uma Therman is at her best in this film.I love how dance is incorporated in the film slightly. This made the film seem more realistic and relate-able to its audience. The scene where Therman and Travolta are dancing is an unforgettable scene for many.
19 August 2014,sahilchaudhary007,1,1,10,Can Watch it Again & Again!!!,"This is an awesome movie that has crime, thrill and comedy. You won't be bored even for a single minute in this 154 minute movie as the story is very interesting and entertaining. The story line is written in such a way that it prevents you to get out of your seat at any point of time. The four stories blend themselves in a very beautiful way that you have might have never seen before. Everyone did superb acting in the movie especially John Travolta and Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarantino has put in some ultimate dialogues in this movie that make the movie special.10 on 10 for this superb movie. Must watch for all!"
17 July 2011,g-bodyl,0,2,9,Unbelievable!,"Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies of the 90's. I heard many excellent things about this movie but for some reasons I never got around to see it. But I have recently and I was impressed. This could even be better than Shawshank Redemption.This movie has 3 stories with all the characters interrelated with each other. We have a boxer who was supposed to lose a fight but didn't, a wife and husband who are intent of robbing a restaurant, and two low-life hit men who are ordered to bring back a stolen suitcase.This movie is filled with A-list actors. This movie resurrects the career of John Travolta. Samuel L. Jackson is just an amazing actor. I loved his quote of the bible. I also like Bruce Willis. He's the man when it comes to action.Quentin Taratino directed a visionary masterpiece. This is one for the history books. I rate this film 9/10."
20 May 2013,lesleyharris30,0,2,10,"Never a Dull Moment,","Pulp Fiction is a fantastic movie with an extremely well thought out plot and an outstanding cast. The film is told like no other, as Quentin Tarantino has different stories taking place over separate time periods. It is very intriguing as we are introduced to the characters stuck in one scenario and are wondering how they got there, and we get to find put later. I did not leave the film feeling there was anything left out, or any plot holes.A wacky universe is created very effectively here by Tarantino, the characters all stand out and each one is perfectly crafted by the director. We are given a great feel for this world and, by the end of it, we truly feel we are a part of it. Of course, another part of bringing these characters to life for its audience is the cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson deliver some of the highlights of their career, the dialogue between Vincent and Jules is some of the best in film history. Uma Thurman also delivers a unique performance and the likes of Bruce Willis, Tim Roth and Ving Rhames come together to make it a ridiculously well rounded cast. The combination of a great director, cast, story and soundtrack make a movie that, even after all these years, is a true individual. Well acted and very engrossing, I would really recommend Pulp Fiction to all movie buffs, particularly if you are a fan of some of Tarantino's other work, this can not be missed. A tale of four separate stories which revolve around two hit men, the hit men's bosses wife, a boxer with a priceless watch and a couple at a diner.Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson"
2 June 2002,MovieTrey,1,2,8,This was a Great Film,"This is a great movie.  I rented it this past weekend and I thought John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were great in the film.  It's a little violent, but overall it's a great film.  The movie is actually three stories that are put together.  It was full of crime and action.  Two thing that I like.  The film could have done without all the cursing.  This isn't a film for the kids.  However, it was a great film.  The three stories fitted perfectly into one another.  However, it did have its slow moments.  This is an automatic classic.  It has some memorable scenes that should be watched over and over again.  Overall, I gave the movie a 8 out of 10.  The other cast members included such names as Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and Tim Roth.  I would also recommend The Matrix, The Godfather or The Godfather Part II."
30 July 2018,imseeg,0,2,10,"""We are all gonna be like 3 little Fonzies. And what is Fonzie like? Fonzie is cool""","Lost count of how many times I have seen it, but over 20 times at least. Every time I enjoy other parts of this story, because there is so much to be liked. First of all: for all those who have never seen it, there is just one advice: stop reading my review and just watch the darn thing! I mean really, not having seen ""Pulp Fiction"" equates to not ever having seen a rainbow. You havent lived without at least seeing a rainbow once, and for that matter if you are a movie lover, you havent lived either without at least seeing ""Pulp Fiction"" once. The violence in this Tarantino flick is very subdued, nobody will get horrified by it. Come to think of it, ""Pulp Fiction"" is the nicest movie of the entire carreer of Tarantino, in which one gangster, who is into the lord, even pledges to abolish all violence, after he witnessed ""a divine intervention"".What's the story about? Tricky question. Tarantino got an oscar for this story and the reason why is obvious, because ""Pulp Fiction"" is without a doubt the most intelligent story in decades. Just experience it and you'll understand. This story structure has been copied by many other directors since, but almost all of them have failed at it. It is not a trick, that can be copied, because Tarantino does it in a way only he can. The succes of this movie is amazing. World wide it broke all records back in the nineties. It would have gotten best picture oscar if it werent for the fact that Tarantino was too young and wasnt a household name yet back then. Almost unthinkable nowadays, but it is true, even Tarantino once was fighting unemployment, struggling to get by with a job at a videostore, in which he truly found his niche by the way, because Tarantino is a walking and talking movie encyclopedia. I just enjoy hearing the man talking about movies, but there is something strange with Tarantino's favorite movies, because he likes pulp. The true definition of pulp is stated at the very beginning of ""Pulp Fiction"" and it says: "" Pulp is a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper"". Quentin Tarantino has told in interviews that in his younger years he read those a lot and many great writers have contributed to these pulp magazines at the start of their carreer. Whatever impact these stories have had on Tarantino he sure has got the talent to tell stories like no other director can. It is almost as if you are watching a theatre play sometimes. And making theatre plays is the future for Tarantino, because he had said he will only make 10 pictures in his life and then he will quit making them. That is a bold statement made out of love for movies, because he knows and everybody else knows that every artist has only got a small period in his life in which he truly excells and makes classics that will stand the test of time. ""Pulp Fiction"" is such a classic and you are about to see it for the very first time. Lucky you!"
1 January 2019,tomasajdari,1,3,6,This moved DIDN'T age well,It is understandable how it got its cult status. The problem is that modern media has grown far beyond that. PF feels like a collection of funny YouTube videos - and that's why it was so good in 1994 (nothing like that available) and not so good today (YT clip culture produced far better)
9 October 2001,cossallpsycho,1,2,10,Cooler than Cool,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is absolutely brilliant.It's is undoubtly one of the funniest and best directed films ever made and to top it all off it is the definitive cool movie.

The movie is simply perfect. I still haven't seen Jackie and Hollywood, and all the other Tarantino's films are nines and tens, but this one will always hold a special place. It won an Oscar for the screenplay, has an awesome cast that plays rarely impressionable characters, ingenious dialogues and monologues, and legendary soundtrack. The perfect balance of drama, action and twisted humor that guarantees top entertainment and impressions that never fade.10/10"

                        ",Tarantino's best work up to now,"Talk about a roller coaster ride! This movie had to be the most fun I had watching!  It never slows down, or even gives you time to breathe.  It has a very excellent style of showing all three stories.  Great writting by Tarantino and Avary.  I really thought it was cool how all the character's lives were connected somehow. ""Pulp Fiction"" has probably the best characters written for the screen. All, I should add, are performed excellently.  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis were great.  I still can't tell if Christopher Walken's speech is supposed to be serious or funny.  I still laugh.  All movie buffs should see this film and love it."

And I also can't believe that Quentin Tarantino has created such ""no head"" and ""no feet"" film...When I saw it, I got very disappointed, because, before watching it, I had seen ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Jackie Brown"", two extraordinary films, so, I thought that I was going to find a similar film here...but, unfortunately, I did not..."
29 May 2017,jacobjohntaylor1,0,2,9,one of the best gangster movies I have seen,This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It a lot better then that gangster crap The Godfather. It also a lot better then that crap The Godfather II. It is also a lot better then that crap The Godfather III. This one of the best gangster movie of all time. It a lot better then Scareface (1983). This movie is just crap. This a great film. If you like ganger movies then you will like this movie. See this movie. It is a great movie. It is a lot better then that crap The Good fellas. See this movie. It is so cool.

                        ",Perfection,"Pulp Fiction is easily one of Tarentino's best films and will live on forever. This movie has spawned more quotes than I can name, and every scene is memorable. Camera work is perfect as to be expected and the film looks beautiful. Tarentino uses violence as an art form. The acting is pretty amazing with an all star cast that really brings everything together. Jackson in particular is really intense, but that's his style. Travolta does an excellent job as very human hit-man Vincent Vega, bringing politeness and a little silliness to his profession. The dialogue is by far the best part of the film though. Vince and Jules's back and forth on subjects from the mundane to the existential are smart and hilarious. Pulp Fiction is also famous for its chronology, which throws most people off the first time they see it. The film asks you to think a little and that's a good thing in my opinion."
17 January 2006,ItsOKihaveabusinesscard,11,34,1,"Are audiences inured to the ""g_ddamns"" and the gore?","It's interesting to read statistics such as "" The word 'f_' was used 463,729 times in this film."" Apparently Quentin Tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar.Movies are made to take the place of storytellers, and when we sit adoringly at Hollywood's knee we expect something fabulous. Not everyone can spin a good yarn, and now we know that even our most promising film makers, regardless of their inauspicious beginnings, cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry. Films like ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino; starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman and many other big names) leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences.Parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view: If a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen, but by the end of this loud, red film he'll be ready for the booby hatch. I worry. When Hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen I'm always afraid youngsters might see it. Heck, I'm not sure anyone should see it.I am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness (ignored the wee-small voice again). I watched the whole thing, and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self-indulgent free-for-all. If I were Catholic I'd probably have to go to Confession just for having sat through this mayhem. Public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways, and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly.It is possible that Quentin Tarantino is a genius. My hope is that his future work will be full and inspired, and that he will begin to move toward the light. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dazzling display of drugs, death and depravity, and I advise you to see it at your own risk.Maureen Adele ComptonPost script: I can't be the only person who thinks it's getting worse. They're using curse words now that even people who do swear wouldn't have dreamed of using in public. I will admit saying ""Aitch-eeee-double-toothpicks"" is cumbersome, and probably wouldn't 'read' well. Having said all that, I could probably stand it if they would just stop using one phrase in particular. You know the one I mean. Say it now, pay for it later. Amen."
7 May 2021,darrenomaolalaidhcnc,2,2,10,Great!,"Amazing movie. This should not be a good movie but it is. It's a simple story divided into 3 chapters, all occurring at different times in the story. Samuel L Jackson is so good in this movie. Bruce Willis is also great along with the rest of the cast. I was laughing the whole way through the movie. There were some great action sequences and intense moments."
8 April 2015,tomgillespie2002,0,2,10,A thrilling exercise in style and substance,"I remember that back in the mid-90's, when Tarantino-mania was in full swing, the motor-mouthed former video store clerk-turned-auteur was always surrounded by controversy. His two movies, Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction were portrayed as cruel, violent and sadistic by the media, while movie critics swooned over his pulpy, reference-heavy characters and innovative dialogue. Over 20 years later, Tarantino's films seem laughably mild compared to the casual ultra-violence of most 18-rated movies regularly released today. But while Reservoir Dogs can arguably be dismissed as a marvellously scripted and meticulously acted rip-off of City on Fire (1987), Pulp Fiction seems as fresh as the day it was released.The black-suited duo of Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and the misty-eyed gangster's moll Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) have been reduced to movie icons, adorning the walls of students and making it easy to forget just how well written they are. Tarantino is fascinated by the humdrum of these casual killers' lives, and their conversations about cheeseburgers, foot- massages and what constitutes a miracle sparkle with invention, intelligence and laugh-out-loud humour. It makes these cartoon characters, who seem they have been ripped straight from the pages of a book found in a dime-store book shop, seem real. Even though they have just shot two unarmed men in cold blood, you would still want to buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brains.Pulp Fiction, as I'm sure you already know, tells three intertwining stories out of chronological order. After successfully obtaining a briefcase belonging to their boss, hit-man Vincent Vega is given the responsibility of looking after the big man's wife, Mia, for the night. He takes her to a retro diner where they talk pop culture and dance to Chuck Berry, and the night's events then take an unexpected turn. Travolta makes for an astonishingly sweet killer and heroin addict, and this story in particular sizzles with sexy dialogue and real chemistry between Travolta and Thurman. The now-infamous scene of an improvised adrenaline shock still has the power to make you wince, while remaining funny and utterly absurd all at the same time.The second story, 'The Gold Watch', focuses on ageing boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), who after failing to follow thorough with his role in a thrown boxing match - organised by Vincent's boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) - flees to the safety of a hotel room and into the arms of his lover Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), who he intends on whisking overseas along with his wad of stolen loot. However, upon realising that Fabienne has failed to pack the gold watch handed down to him through many generations and eventually by his father's friend Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), he must return home to reclaim it. The events that transpire are some of the most outlandish work Tarantino has ever done, filled with gunfire, mutilation, rape, and a gimp. Such relentless brutality may have been off-putting, but Tarantino keeps you reassured that it's okay to laugh at what you're seeing, that it's only a movie. It's a textbook lesson in black comedy.The narrative then jumps back in time to Vincent and Jules in the aftermath of the hit seen at the start of the movie. After an extremely gory accident, they are forced off the road and seek the hospitality of Jimmie (played by Tarantino himself). They hire professional fixer Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who races against the clock to clean up the mess before Jimmie's wife arrives home from a night shift. The film climaxes at the diner shown in the opening scene, as Vincent and Jules's quiet breakfast is interrupted by a husband and wife stick- up team (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer). The third segment is the funniest and features the most memorable dialogue, as Winston tries to motivate an objectionable Vincent (""pretty please, with a cherry on top, clean the f*****g car,""), and Jules educates his new foe's following the life-altering miracle he believes he has just witnessed.Featuring highly on practically every 'best of' list from 1994 to the present, Pulp Fiction needs no introduction and I doubt it ever will. Though I have enjoyed all of Tarantino's movies with the exception of 2007's tedious Death Proof (though it fares better when viewed in its Grindhouse entirety), I don't rate him as a truly great film-maker, as I don't feel he has ever managed to shake his compulsion to homage. But Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece, like nothing else made before or since (though many attempts have been made in vain). A thrilling exercise in style and substance, beneficial to cinema as a whole and responsible for re- igniting a few careers on the way. I cannot see Tarantino ever topping his achievements here, but then again his movies never fail to surprise me.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
16 August 2019,pmtelefon,0,2,10,Top ten of all time.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the greats. Why does this movie work so well? I don't know, movie magic I guess. It's impossible to explain to the layman how great this movie is. It has a great cast saying some of the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It's filled with great performances. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson have never been better (and that says a lot). ""Pulp Fiction"" is not a perfect movie but it comes real close. It never gets old. It's a true classic."
7 January 2007,solidgameboy12-1,1,3,10,Superb and amazing. Fantastic.,"If there are a lot of things in the 90's to recognize, one of them is Pulp Fiction. The Fantastic film by Quentin Tarantino that (next to Reservoir Dogs) is probably one of the most memorable titles ever released.The film begins a lot like Reservoir Dogs; For those who haven't seen that movie (As I have, but saw it after everyone else saw it)I will not spoil anything, but it begins like a Tarantino movie does, very weird and almost like it's in another world. It's reality, but in a very warped state of reality, where the world we live in is like the one we live in, but constant danger exists around every corner.The film then starts to the credits and leads the way into a series of events that tell you how the event we have just witnessed in the beginning started. It's kind of confusing to translate without giving away a lot, which is yet another reason to watch this movie.If there is anything I can give away, it's just about the stories, but anymore and this comment will need a spoiler warning.Story one follows Vincent and Jules (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), two men whose priorities are to retrieve something, and discussing the events of something Vincent is supposed to do with a character Marsellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife.The 2nd event involves a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis) whose life was changed by an event from his youth that follows up to the present time.The final event mentions some characters I cannot begin to mention because of the spoilers in that it will ruin the viewing experience to anyone who sees it.I'm gonna be honest, This is my first viewing of Pulp Fiction, and I've seen the countless parodies that have followed along with it. However, that shouldn't be a reason to not see it. Having seen the parodies, it still helps to see the movie, now 13 years old, to see what shocked a lot of viewers in the 90's. This film is violent. I'm not gonna deny that. This is a Tarantino movie, it's going to be violent, it's going to have language, and it is long and a bit confusing at times, but it is without a doubt, one of the single best movies ever made.No doubt, it's episodic cinema that is perfect to watch, and it's brilliant. You think Kill Bill and Sin City are good, WATCH THIS MOVIE. if you didn't think they were good, WATCH THIS MOVIE, it cannot be avoided. I rate it a 10 out of 10."
14 September 2008,johnnyboyz,0,2,10,"Just a thrilling, postmodernist roller coaster through several genres; three stories and one unforgettable experience.","There isn't much that can be added that hasn't already been said when it comes to the modern masterpiece that is Pulp Fiction. I suppose to some it's one of those films that you specifically remember when you first heard about it; when you first saw it; where you were when your first saw it and what the circumstances were at that time. Given it has become so popular and so influential in its own retrospect with so many people having seen it so many times as individuals, it carries that sense of accomplishment and historical significance, perhaps not only on a level of cinema as a whole but to a culture  to a generation of active filmgoers post 1994.I can remember first seeing Pulp Fiction  the night before Halloween, 2003. I think up until that point I was naïve or immature when it came to cinema. Here was a film that gave me a prod; a wake up call to do with films as a whole. Here was a film that, I suppose, brainwashed me into a realisation that films didn't have to be progressive, linear, big on action and set pieces or of an entertainment value. To have Pulp Fiction take me through a roller-coaster ride of out of sync story telling (something I hadn't experienced in a film up until watching this); dialogue said by characters breaking down images of stereotypes; humour so black it has the power to make you put your hand over your mouth and shake your head in sheer embarrassment that you might find certain content even mildly amusing and just a continual flow of action, reaction and spontaneity that captivated me was a film experience I am wary I may never experience again.And while 2001: A Space Odyssey came close to delivering that same 'wow' experience about a year ago, you have to spare a thought for today's generation and their experience. Through certain websites that give you unlimited amounts of videos, you can instantly access all of Pulp Fiction's 'best bits' in a fragmented and spontaneous manner. I don't know how popular or well endowed certain video websites were back in late 2003, I didn't use the Internet as much back then, but I went into that initial Pulp Fiction viewing with absolutely no knowledge of any scene I was about to witness and came out someone who was suddenly into films; realised films could be different, almost experimental. I realised films could be influenced by previous ideas and these things called film 'movements' that were around decades before.So watching Pulp Fiction now recalls that first viewing and not the many after it, all of which were motivated perhaps out of feint hope I might be taken on that same, initial roller-coaster ride. Watching this film recently for the first time in about three years and having learnt and read a great deal more about the film and films that influenced it, it's no real surprise that I do feel it is one of the best ever made. Pulp Fiction taps into cinema of past years but reinvents and updates thus influencing a whole new brand of 'type', something evident in the late nineties but certainly now, in the new century. The manner in which the dialogue is delivered and the dialogue period seems less-so a gimmick with age than it did when it first came out. The manner in which director Tarantino audaciously flips from realism to escapism, often in one shot, is unheard of and best seen with Mia's visual 'square' imitation and the frequent title cards popping up to contradict the urban realism of everyday dialogue and long tracking shots of realistic people making their way through everyday locations.Pulp Fiction recalls a lot of Tarantino's work prior to Pulp Fiction. It begins in a diner (alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers); contains characters whom are young, in love couples that enjoy killing people/robbing places; contains Mexican standoffs (again alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers) and carries that popular culture aura that just balances the film on that edge between realism and escapism in a way only Tarantino could at the time. Pulp Fiction is a postmodernist explosion of sorts; combing genres of romance, crime, gangster and comedy into one package. Characters plant seeds of doubt in the audience's minds ranging from a potential date with Mia (Thurman) to the menace that surrounds the character of Marsellus Wallace (Rhames) and what he might do when certain betrayals are made.One new thing I noticed when re-watching it recently was the manner in which Christopher Walken's character prior to his monologue 'hopes he (a young Butch) will never have to face a situation like that (in a POW camp) and take on certain responsibilities.' This echoes Butch's ultimate act of redemption that is to come in the sense he will be a prisoner (of war, I suppose) and will have to take on certain acts of responsibility in being a saviour all motivated through the want for the gold watch around which the story is entitled.Another item could be the way in which blatant violence is set up to be ignored for a bigger deal such as when a bystander is shot accidentally by Marsellus after a car crash (but the concentration is the chase after it) and a certain individual has his head blown off (but the concentration is the very bloody car interior and what they will now do). Pulp Fiction is essential viewing for anyone that even remotely considers themselves 'into' cinema. The European influence and contemporary referencing is second to none culminating in Pulp Fiction: one of the greatest American films ever made."
27 May 2008,outoftouch69,43,103,1,Wow!!!!,"I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an ""F"" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, especially for something so highly praised."
16 September 2016,macisaac_44,1,1,10,My Favourite Movie 5ever,"This movie is so good every piece of dialogue is gold.Tarantino pays homage to classic film making while at the same time solidifying his own place in movie history. Its a great way to build his legacy after Reservoir Dogs and just shows how much work he puts into every aspect of his craft. The jumbling plot is great as it moves back and forth in time to create a unique atmosphere within itself. The story is unique and goes through a lot of twists to keep its self fresh and ready for re watch again, again and again.I only wish it was longer, so I could stay in its rich world longer. All I have to say is thank you Tarantino."
2 April 2019,BobbyGuts,1,3,8,HMM.......,"One of the toughest movies I've had to rate & review.
Firstly it does not represent the title ""PULP FICTION"" because real PULP does not involve Tarantino's tangents of food and his social frustrations. Real pulp is gritty, hard boiled, and most importantly believable, written by writers who don't try and survive on their own humor. The movie will never be bad and has a VERY attractive theme, compelling/interesting scenes and some organic, grade-A acting BUT you can feel when a filmmaker is flattering themselves for being unconventional. Tarantino loves to play the shock factor- Something that was fresh for the time (1994). It's a variety show that feeds the feeling of ""Bad but Cool"" and has become more transparent as time has gone forward. I can agree that it has STRONG replay value and all the means to be a classic but to be critically acclaimed and considered a landmark for film? Maybe not. Some parts feel immature as others bloom boldly. For most of the movie I wouldn't praise it for it's content only delivery, although- the exception being the last scenes textual brilliance- That much I'll admit. One of the great endings purely moved by text. That much I'll admit**"
27 April 2005,kxmoore,15,31,4,Nerd's Catharsis,"Nerd Quentin shot his load in making this film. Geeks who never saw real violence were given the pleasure and permission to laugh as caricature humans get blown away on screen. Quent tapped into an audience who would never have to go to war and were sheltered from the more brutal realities of the American underclass. And you know what?

12 November 2013,videorama-759-859391,0,2,9,"Bullets, baddies, and lots of exciting fiction in QT masterpiece","In a hundred years, PF is still gonna be remembered as an ultra cool movie. It's like something QT has ever written and never will again. It's a refreshing wild, exciting movie experience. The movie's brilliant dialogue has you hooked from the word ""Go"". So many people love Pulp Fiction, but if you asked them what's about, it'd be interesting to hear their answers. In a nutshell it's three stories, it's about losers, fighting the odds, but the losers are characters we become involved about. Some of them we even admire. We have two professional hit men, who cross paths with a pathetic couple of losers, who this time, decide to rob a restaurant. You'll like how this scene pans out. The other loser is Willis, a down on his luck, boxer, who's asked to throw a fight, but good old pride, has him doing the opposite. This is just a cool movie through and through, QT's follow up to 'Dog's' with some of the same attire, though surprisingly not as gory, as compared to 'Dogs', or especially True Romance, or NBK. It's occasional, some of it shocking, esp the 'blowing off head scene' when a sorry shot accidentally goes off from Vince Vega's (John Travolta's) gun, with little expense of remorse for the poor SOB, and The Wolf (a great Harvey Keitel in a great character role) is called upon at short notice to clean up the mess. Travolta deserved his Oscar nomination, as did Jackson (a bloody underrated and fine actor) as his sidekick, Jules. It's a 154 minute thrill ride, (exact same running time as Jackie Brown) amidst style, dancing, burger trivia, injecting, and some ludicrous scenes, one a shootout, others involving Zed and the gimp, that's leads to a reconciliation between Willis, and his rival, head baddie, Marcellas Wallace, (the excellent Ving Rhames) which was another one of the movie's surprises. Walken again appears as a Colonel, delivering a great monologue, involving a watch, hidden protectively, in not the healthiest of storage places. The dancing between JT and UT at the hip burger place, is another unforgettable scene. The story just cruises along, and we just let ourselves be taken along for the ride, up until it's clever, no, not dejavu end. Every performance is as great as the last in a movie hit, that may never ever, ever die. QT's finest moment. Watch."

                        ",boring,"i saw this when it first came out and i didn't like it then.  i figured i'd give it another shot.  once again i don't think it's a very good movie. like most Tarantino films, it could have been great, but it just never fulfilled it's own promise.  had the entire movie been about Jackson's and Travolta's characters, i would probably have really enjoyed the movie. but the whole Uma Thurman storyline was just a waste.  i found myself wanting to see more of Jackson and Travolta.  the Bruce Willis storyline was bad, the whole ball gag scene had no point and offset any ""genius"" in this movie. when the hitmen were on, i enjoyed it, anything else was completely boring and pointless.  and the whole disjointed storytelling was certainly not anything new."
29 August 2000,mse1576,1,2,9,Brilliant; Full of Symbolism,"It's been a while since I've seen this film, but I marvel at its complexity, both in its form and its meaning.When Jules utters ""lets get into character"" at the beginning of the film(near the end, depending on how you look at it), Tarentino is forcing us to examine what is fictitious and what is real. His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to ""wander the earth"" as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures. Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus' wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction."
12 January 2016,Vartiainen,0,1,10,"Story with almost no structure, but a lot of cohesion","Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus and a film that inspired countless imitators. A film that is one of those everyone knows intimately, without ever having seen a minute of it. A film where four completely separate tales intertwine as their characters go on about their criminal, immoral lives.To talk about the story or the plot would be foolishness. You cannot really explain it in any meaningful way without spoiling it completely. Besides, you already know approximately how it goes. If, however, you're young enough or hermit enough that you don't know, I can at least try my level best. It opens with two low-end robbers sitting in a diner and talking about their next gig. As they stand up to put their plan into action, we cut to two completely unrelated dudes talking about the differences between fast food product names in different countries. Doesn't sound that riveting, but it strangely is. The two dudes are gangsters. Hit men on their way to lay some vengeance on some unhappy souls.The real genius of the film starts to reveal itself when these stories start to intertwine. Suddenly one of the gangsters meets the boss's wife from another story or the boxer is actually working for the same guy the two gangsters are. The stories are also told out of order, bringing a whole new level of meta knowledge to the viewing experience. One of the best examples of storytelling I've ever seen on film.I also really like the inconsequential scenes. Like the talk about burgers in the beginning or the taxi drive the boxer takes after his last match. The latter scene adds absolutely nothing, except perhaps deepening Butch's character a little bit, but it's such a great scene that I don't want it to be cut away. The taxi driver, Esmeralda, is such a captivating character. Almost like the protagonist of a completely different movie suddenly wanderer into this film. And they're all like that. They don't add a lot to the plot, but they're absolutely necessary for the style, the mood and the texture the film has.Pulp Fiction is a great film. One of my all-time favourites. It's one hundred percent Tarantino and is one of those films you can watch over and over and still find something new you didn't notice before or had already forgotten because the film is so full of details to appreciate. It is violent and gory, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it's also lethally charismatic and suave. Just like a gangster film should be."

I really love the dialogue in this movie, well, moreso I'd say the script, how everyone moves, reacts and the things they all say will keep you laughing through the whole film, this movie, even though its nearly 3 hours, FLIES by so gracefully, a true cinematic masterpiece!! I LOVE QT"
15 March 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,0,2,8,Groovin to the Movin,"This film is far from the best film of the 1990's, but it DOES feature one of John Travolta's best performances. I'm talking about his performance, not his character, or the movie surrounding it.As far as Pulp Fiction the Movie, it is stylistic, quirky, evenly balanced in its chaos, and thoroughly enjoyable. It is not the instant classic many people have proclaimed it to be, but it IS fun, witty, clever, and entertaining in its Tarantinoisms and ""hip"" stylizations, and makes for an entertaining 2 hours or so.It's worth a viewing or two, and rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :."
16 December 2012,BeneCumb,0,2,10,Great in every way... And different in many ways,"Chronologically, it is the last of the wow-movies for me so far; the other two are Cabaret (1972) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). I can still remember my thoughts and ravishment during and after seeing Pulp Fiction - directing and plot compilation was so different, and the director was totally unknown to me (I had not heard of Reservoir Dogs before). And the cast: plenty of that-time and/or current stars, even in smaller roles, with the budget less than 10 million USD! Many effects, manners, ideas are still conceptional, and lots of later parodies and imitations have just fastened its place in the movie history. Luckily, Pulp Fiction was praised and prized already directly after screening, sometimes big innovations and improvements are understood years after.I have seen all Tarantino's movies and Pulp Fiction is still the one I like most, although I cannot say the others are bad, weak or something, but Pulp has undoubtedly the most sophisticated storyline and the wittiest dialogs/remarks."

9 June 2009,mitchelledwards,1,2,10,A Trip Through Hell,"The film starts off strong and never looses momentum, no matter how many times I see it I can always watch it from opening to closing credits. Taranitno is an excellent director and gives the viewer the sense of actually being involved in the actions going on in his world. I also feel that all of his characters are written so well that they feel real, even with all of the outlandish events that transpire through the film there is some very strong character development. None of the characters are that likable but Tarantino and Avery make them likable through the dialouge. Also all of the performances in my opinion just enhance the likability of the characters. My favorite segment in the film involves Bruce Willis character and I don't want to give anything away but it really is hell being depitcted on screen. Well I can't really go into plot details without giving anything away so I will conclude by saying that this was a film that defined a decade and it is definitely worth a watch."
8 November 2012,adam_evans14,1,2,9,The most interactive film around!!!,"As Tarantino states, its not confusing. You have to watch it but thats all he asks. And if you do you'll become embroiled with the most self reflexive film around. Cluttered with inter textual references to pop culture e.g pilots,Marilyn Monroe,Fonzie etc Tarantinos sublimely definitive post modern film highlights its artifice and as such we are suckered in.While the prudish may squirm at a 'immature celebration of violence' I personally applaud the profound approach of Tarantino presenting us with such outlandishly gruesome violence (pieces of brain etc) that we can do nothing but laugh. And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see. I love Inglorious Basterds but i cant decide whether it tops Pulp Fiction. Either way both are amazing. Watch this film."
24 August 2019,lukem-52760,0,2,9,A CLASSIC 90's MESMERIZING CRIME DRAMA,"Everyone know's the huge impact Tarantino's ""PULP FICTION"" had in the 90's, it was huge & is still considered one of the greatest movies ever made,No need to talk about the story as everyone who loves movies knows all about it.
Tarantino was like a rock star by the time his masterpiece 2nd film came out, Reservoir dogs was an instant CLASSIC & everyone knew the name Tarantino, as a film geek turned amazing film director he touched us movie geeks big time, Tarantino was one of us film obsessed nerds who made it to directing what he loved about cinema.
I love Tarantino & think he's probably the greatest director of all time along with John Carpenter.
His 90's films were & are still my favourite of his as that's when the impact of his genius hit me, i was obsessed with From Dusk Till Dawn which he starred in & co-wrote but was directed by his friend the equally excellent ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, we had Tarantino's blood soaked debut ""RESERVOIR DOGS"", his masterpiece ""PULP FICTION"" & his truly BRILLIANT ""JACKIE BROWN"" it was a great time for his films & pure genius.
I was lucky enough to have grown up in the 90's & being obsessed with anything Tarantino related,
Pulp fiction is a masterpiece of cinema, it's a crime tale that's a gritty crime drama & ultra violent Thriller, there's hilarious humour & intense situations & Classic moments, Pulp Fiction is the movie that everyone still talks about & is one of the best reviewed films in cinema history!!!
I love this movie & it's amazing cast.
Tarantino's 90's films are still my favourite of his amazing career.Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez were heroes to me growing up & still are but the 90's was their hey day & the best for both of their genius to explode on the screen."
13 October 2018,kubracakiir,2,3,10,Masterpiece thanks Tarantino,"One word can describe this ""movie"". Brilliant. How can a movie be soo good. Its like indescribable. All scenes in this movie. Nothing is unnecessary."
14 October 2013,ZeeRaaN,1,2,9,cliché free action movie,"I can totally see why this movie was a hit in 1994, it introduced a new path for action movies, dialogue based action movies which keeps you interested in what the characters would say rather than do. back then, most action movies were based on lame gun shots and chasing each other. i thought the chapters concept was very interesting and intriguing. i think Quentin Tarantino did a great job in blending in the chapters as the movie goes on. also, although the description of the movie wont indicate, this movie is a comedy, black comedy to be specific. where you laugh at situations that should not be funny (but they were hilarious).also the performances were great by the entire cast.however, since this movie is a dialogue based movie, and as a non native English speaker, i think i couldn't enjoy this movie as much as those who could understand what every word meant without the manipulation of subtitles. as a result, i was bored at some scenes and thought the movie was too long."
21 June 2003,jefflittle19,1,2,7,Only Tarantino could think of this,A very original story that could only be thought up by Tarantino. This is the film that put John Travolta back on the map and Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific in his role. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career and Uma Thurman probably gives the best performance of hers. The cinematography is excellent and Tarantino really established himself as one of America's best directors with this film. A terrific movie that can be watched many times!My rating : @@@@ (out of five)
23 October 2005,MaxBorg89,0,4,10,Ignore the Academy: this is the best picture of 1994,"And the Oscar goes to...Forrest Gump? With all due respect, Gump may be a very good film, but both The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction were more deserving of winning Best Picture of 1994 (as well as some other awards). Now, the latter may have been too innovative, weird or extreme back then, but the French knew what they were doing when Pulp received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, beginning its route to being recognized as one of the most influential pictures of the '90s (alongside Fight Club, it's also my all-time favorite movie). Whereas Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino's debut film, told one story by jumping back and forth in time (similarly to Stanley Kubrick's The Killing), his second masterpiece gets more ambitious, combining separate episodes in a non-linear way: it starts with two thieves (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discussing new places to rob; then there are two gangsters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) who fulfill various assignments for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) while talking about foot massages and French cheeseburgers (a smart and funny detour from the stereotyped taciturn hit men we are used to); later, Vince has to take Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for dinner, with shocking and hilarious results; and finally, there is also a boxer (Bruce Willis) who is trying to sever his ties with organized crime. And somehow all these events are connected, in unexpected, genuinely amusing ways.The chronological structure might irritate some viewers, but fundamentally the plot is merely an instrument to allow the characters to interact. And what interaction: Tarantino's dialogue is sharp and exhilarating, showing that when you hand it to the right people even the most absurd subject is a pleasure to listen to. From Jackson quoting the Bible (""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."") to an awesome argument on how to get rid of a corpse (at which point the director himself, playing a minor role, delivers the priceless line: ""Did you see a sign outside my house that said ""Dead n**gger storage""?""), Pulp Fiction has one of the most quotable scripts of all time.How ironic then, that the film's most iconic and talked-about scene is completely wordless: Travolta and Thurman dancing to Chuck Berry's You Never Can Tell. It's the one sequence everybody knows, even if they haven't seen the movie, and it is still a great scene, largely thanks to the perfect chemistry between the two stars, and the rest of the cast lives up to the task as well: Jackson in particular is at his raging best, and he's easily matched by Travolta (whose career was dangerously close to a shameful end before he was offered the part of Vince), while the QT veterans (Roth, Harvey Keitel) and newcomers (Willis and, in a surreal monologue, Christopher Walken) slip into their roles as if they were wearing tailored suits. As for Thurman, look no further than the restaurant conversation between Mia and Vince to understand why she was the first and only choice to play the lead in Kill Bill.Witty, grotesque and brilliant (often at the same time), Pulp Fiction is a seminal '90s flick and without a doubt Tarantino's best work. There have been several rip-offs since then, but those are best ignored: nothing can match the sheer genius of the original, a film to watch, love and watch again."
25 July 2021,gianmarcoronconi,0,1,10,Very violent,"Very violent but also very funny and at times demented and meaningless, that's why the film is very nice and manages to entertain great without ever getting you to anoiate."

6 September 2009,chrstphrtully,2,14,3,One of the Most Overrated Pictures of All-Time,"1994 was an interesting film year, in that it produced two of the most highly lauded films in recent memory -- Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump -- which, in my humble opinion, are both grossly overrated. I'm not sure I could say Pulp Fiction is the worse of the two, but it's certainly the more disappointing.The reason for this is that Quentin Tarantino's script demonstrates his flair for hip, knowing dialogue, and his ability to use such dialogue to take the edge off violence (a good or bad thing, depending upon your views). The problem is that, rather than use this gift to create characters in whom you are actually interested in following, Tarantino instead opts for the equivalent of writing and directorial masturbation -- i.e., showing what he can do merely for the purpose of showing that he can do it, without any real concern for character or plot. Such an approach may be call for praise from critics and devotees, but for me they are a grievously missed opportunity. Indeed, what was wildly praised as ingenious film-making (i.e., through the non-linear and looping time order of the scenes) instead smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character.As for the highly lauded performances, only three really stand out for me, and two -- Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken -- in glorified cameos. The only other truly developed character is that of Samuel L. Jackson, whose character discovers something from his experiences, and attempts to act on what he has learned. The other performances in the film range from the passable (Ving Rhames), to the flat (Bruce Willis), to the really annoying (John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Amanda Plummer).If you want to see the best Tarantino film, watch a film where he creates believable characters and puts them through their paces, albeit with the help of Elmore Leonard source material -- Jackie Brown."
5 May 2020,aidanratesmovies,0,1,10,It's a Masterpiece,"With all around great performances, a very unique storyline, and fantastic direction from Tarantino, Pulp Fiction doesn't just serve as Tarantino's best film, but as one of the greatest masterpieces of film of all time. The film stars many great performances, most notably Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson. Each actor truly gives themselves fully to their role, and you are rooting for them and against them almost every step of the way. It's a surreal experience to watch, and one that is certainly memorable, and extremely entertaining- even throughout its massive runtime. The film's pacing is excellent, with it never truly letting up, and you finding the most out of every scene given. Tarantino's writing is excellent, and very poignant, it takes old themes and develops them into something very unique, timeless, and refreshing. However, it never relies on these tropes too much though, so much so, you can hardly call them tropes at all. It's cinematography is excellent, providing some truly interesting and engaging shots, with a signature style. It's soundtrack is also equally impressive, and one I might consider getting on Vinyl in the future. It's a fresh vision and masterwork from one of the greatest directors of all time, and is truly an impressive feat to match. It's rewatchable, well acted, perfectly directed and written, with some stunning cinematography and an excellent soundtrack. Needless to say, the film has it all, and it is something truly original that many will try to imitate, but none will ever come close.

5 April 2013,jfarms1956,1,7,2,Lots of good actors/actresses,"This is a movie for the18+ crowd. This is a serious popcorn cruncher movie. John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, and Vhing Rhames all make this film worth watching. Typical and predictable plot. I enjoy performances from Bruce Willis and Vhing Rhames. Males may like this film better that females. A good ""guy get together"" film. Although John Travolta is not one of my favorite actors, he gives a somewhat believable performance for his character. Because John Travolta is one of the main characters, I rated it down. John Travolta plays a character that is too slick to be believable. It was Bruce Willis, Vhing Rhames, and Uma Thurman who help save this film. This movie is about 20 minutes too long. It could have had tighter editing."

Not disappointed about the movie, but disappointed it had to end.  You need to pay attention to all the words for it to make sense, but once you make sense out of it...what a wonderful movie.  It won many awards and nominations, which it deserved.  Pulp Fiction is number 18 on IMDB's top 250 list, it got 5 out of 5 stars on Allmovies.com, it is on the AFI (American Film Institute) as #95, and Uma Thurman and John Travolta won an MTV award for best dance sequence.  The cast is WONDERFUL (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, an appearance my QT himself, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken).

                        ",Pulp for thought,"I like some things about this film-in particular the career revival of John Travolta. That was good. He needed this. And Bruce Willis was fun too, as the boxer. But we could have done without the Deliverance stuff in the pawn shop, and I think the shootings were rather gratuitous too. The characters spent a lotta time talking about McDonalds in Paris and what, the Brady Bunch? Pop culture references, which suddenly became the rage in Hollywood, which if not handled right will make you sick.I give Tarentino credit for stealing from all the right places, and for putting the stuff together to make for an entertaining film, though it will make you wince or cringe or whatever at times. But it isn't exactly an Oscar caliber film to my thinking, if you want that, go check out Lonestar.*** outta ****, not as bad as it could have been."
5 April 2017,PredragReviews,0,1,9,"""And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.""","'Pulp Fiction' is a beloved film that made Tarantino's career, plus revitalizing John Travolta's career in the process. The storytelling is masterful as well, with three distinct stories coming together in unusual ways to complete the scrambled narrative. And each individual story takes such wild turns, upending clichés in every instance possible, that the end result is a movie that compels the viewer to return for additional viewings. The casting is also first-rate, including John Travolta (Vincent Vega), Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield), Ving Rhames (Marsellus Wallace, the Mob Boss), Uma Thurman (Mia.. she appeared in Kill Bill series 9 years later), Bruce Willis (Butch Coolidge, the aged boxer). Cameos included Harvey Keitel (Winston Wolfe, problem fixer), Christopher Walken (Captain Koons), Steve Buscemi (Buddy Holly look-alike) and of course Quentin himself as Jimmie. The plot is non-linear and features a number of bizarre stories that connect the main characters. These all involve two hit men Vincent and Jules, crime lord Marsellus Wallace and boxer Butch Coolidge. The main stories include Vincent taking Wallace's wife out and the trouble it leads too, 'The Gold Watch' which sees Butch having to throw a fight and find his watch with some serve consequences, and 'The Bonnie Situation' (my favourite) where Vincent and Jules must dispose of their bloody car. In between these we get a robbery at a diner and a number of preludes. All the stories mix wonderfully and are packed with hilarious lines, intense drama and downright weird circumstances.Despite the massive cast, the acting is phenomenal. John Travolta re-launched his career as the super cool Vincent and Samuel L Jackson is amazing too, with some of the best lines in film history. Bruce Willis is great and Ving Rhames is utterly convincing with Uma Thurman hanging loose as his wife. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer have great chemistry and brilliant lines, while Harvey Keitel is wonderful as the problem solving Wolf. The small supporting roles are excellent. Eric Stoltz is hilarious as drug dealer Lance, equally funny is Christopher Walken and Peter Greene is creepy as can be as sadist Zed. The script can't be praised enough. There are some absolutely hysterical lines and ingenious pop culture references. Lines like ''Royale with cheese'', ''Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead'' and ''I love you Pumpkin, I love you Honey Bunny'' are all as quotable as movie lines get. Tarantino uses music expertly again, ''Jungle Boogie'' and ''Son Of A Preacher Man'' are great. The films main power is that fact that it manages to mix so many diverse genres together so effectively, there are elements of drama, thriller, comedy and satire along with the powerful characters and complex plot which transform Pulp Fiction into one of the all-time greats.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
29 April 2000,Nick_Milligan,1,2,10,A flawless film,"This is a cinematic masterpiece. It is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema. It contains, arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film. Everybody in the world should see this movie. No matter what age. 5 stars"
24 September 2006,gangstahippie,0,4,10,Tarintino's Best!,"Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality.I have seen all the Quentin Tarintino films except for Jackie Brown.I own Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill Vol.2 on DVD.I first started liking Tarintino when I saw Kill Bill Vol.1.I then saw Vol.2 and then Reservoir Dogs.Now Pulp Fiction.Everybody has been saying that Pulp Fiction is Tarintino's best film.They are not wrong.Pulp Fiction is in fact Tarintino's best.This is now one of my favorite movies.Everything about this film is great! The acting is superb.The film has an all star cast which consists of Tim Roth,Harvey Keitel,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Uma Thurman,Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames.The acting in the film is definitely superb.Then there is the plot.The plot is very interesting.It basically shows the lives of two hit men,a boxer,a mob boss and a bunch of other characters and how their lives inter-wind with each other.There are plenty of stories in the film relating to the different characters.The stories are not in order however.Pulp Fiction is an excellent film and I recommend buying it!.It definitely deserves its spot in the Top 250! Runtime:168min 10/10"
15 August 2007,moviewizguy,0,3,10,Now This is An American Classic,"Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.Great! Why did it take me so long to watch this film? Maybe because it's never on sale. Well, it finally was and I bought it on DVD. Let me take this moment to calm myself down. Before watching this movie, I was anxious of what all this hype for this movie is all about. I would've thought it would have been overrated because I did not like ""Reservoir Dogs"" as much as others.But I was wrong. Why would I even think that? This is the third Quentin Tarantino film I have seen and it is easily the best of the bunch. Not only that. This film, without exaggerating, is a masterpiece! I loved every minute of it! I loved it so much I wanted it to be three hours long or at least have another story in it!Okay, it's been three days since I've watched this film and yes, the excitement have wear off but who cares? It had me excited for the other two days. For those of you people who haven't seen this film, this film is completely character driven. Now only that but the dialog in here is so great, this film won't lose your attention, even though there's dialog 60 seconds per minute.If you think character driven films are boring, maybe this isn't the film for you. I just can't get my mind off of the dialog, which was so eccentric and brilliant. This is an American classic. The characters in here are also very lovable. John Travolta seems like Tom Hanks in The Da Vinci Code with his hair due.Now off with the characters and dialog. The film is really well crafted and totally original. This is also, maybe, my first film that has three plots revolving around so maybe I might also like ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"". And should I mention the music? I loved each one of them but I should say I was let down by the Travolta and Thurman dance sequence. I expected it to be flashy as a musical but what was I thinking?This is what more filmmakers should do these days. Yeah, I'm fine with remakes and sequels but it would be so much better if they make films like Pulp Fiction. If you watch this film, you would see why it had a cult following."
16 July 2003,JohnSelf,1,2,10,Brilliant,"Judging from some of the other reviews posted here, there are people that actually dislike this movie.  I suppose the violence and drug use might turn some people off, but that is absolutely not what this movie is about.  The dialogue just crackles in this movie.  Almost every scene is pitch perfect - Christopher Walken's watch delivery speech, that opening discussion about buying drugs in Amsterdam, etc.  It is really sad that there are people that don't like this movie. I feel sorry for them, but at the same time am very glad I don't know them."
3 March 2003,cnwiper,1,2,10,Perverted cinematic perfection,"This is a superb movie and definitely one of my favorites of all time.The action is intense and highly entertaining, the characters cool but mortal, the acting close to perfect by an all star cast that shines throughout ,the dialogues  clever and Tarantino's disturbed genius provides a cinematic spectacle not to be missed by any fan of the art.The film has everything except from ""true love"".You can find the non stop struggle to survive or to gain power and money ,sex ,drugs, rock and roll,an instantly ""classic"" dance scene,moral dilemmas,clever back and forth plot twists even touches of distorted romance and existential concerns.The pace ranges from slow to frantic..   Maybe there is too much violence for the conservative viewer.But who needs conservatism when it comes to judging art? The creative madness of the gifted director in this gangster film combines humor , coolness , realism and an almost cartoonish at times surrealism accompanied by a suitable soundtrack that contributes immensely to the whole larger than life atmosphere.The heroes are likeable and their strengths and weaknesses despite their seemingly cool behavior are exposed in their moments of glory and decline (not necessarily in a chronological order) in a masterful manner. Chance can determine their fate and nobody is above the realities of a cruel merciless world in their quest for well, hedonism rather than happiness...No faults,just sheer cinematic enjoyment for the open minded cinema lover..10 out of 10..."
22 April 1999,DeeNine-2,0,1,8,We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys,"Well, it rocks, I guess. It jumps. It moves. It's flashy and clever. The acting is excellent. The direction is interesting... I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power. How much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy. John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a ""low-rent"" hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right! How come they never did that before: they probably did, I just missed it.). Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood. We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a cliché. The art part comes from doing spins on the cliché, in putting a new twist on the old bull****, on the old standards. Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman. He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. Poor Hollywood. They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
27 May 2005,Brooklyn-Boy,1,2,10,This is my favorite film ever!!!,"Pulp: a magazine or book printed on cheap paper (as newsprint) and often dealing with sensational material, Fiction: something invented by the imagination or feigned; specifically : an invented story b : fic This is my favorite film ever, and for many reasons...""and you will know my name is the Lord when i lay my vengeance on them"".. (gunshots)Is a very innovative film, the characters are L.A gangsters, (except for the Butch character who is a boxer running away from the gangsters), but very likable and with a lot of personality.The way they have different stories but at the end all stories go together, the dialogues, the quotes, even the soundtrack.. anyway, this is the best movie ever made, very original an clever and with an unique style, definitely it should win an Oscar. 10/10"

2 May 2015,Screen_Blitz,0,1,10,Darkly funny genre-bending piece easily marks one of the best films of cinematic history,"Quentin Tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this incredibly unique black comedy black comedy Pulp Fiction. Boasting a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz; this bold genre-bending piece demonstrates Tarantino exercising his unique style of direction in arguably his most polished fashion yet. Told in a nonlinear perspective, this film follows three interconnecting story lines centering on a wide range of characters in their life of crime in the city of Los Angeles. Followed by a tense introduction of two restaurant robbers (played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), we are introduced to two tuxedo-suited hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L. Jackson) as they make a hit for their mob boss Marcellis Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) that goes awry. This is followed by Vincent Vega on a platonic date with Marcellis's wife Mia (played by Uma Thurman), next storyline introduces us to a championship boxer Butch Coolidge (played by Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend Fabienne (played by Maria De Medeiros); followed by the aftermath of Vincent and Jules's mob hit where they meet with Jules' friend Jimmy (played by Quentin Tarantino himself) and Winston Wolfe (played by Harvey Keital) to help them out of their predicament. When it comes to writing sharp dialogue and a long range of exotically colorful characters, that is where director Quentin Tarantino's cinematic expertise shines the brightest. In other words, he proves more than capable of writing a finely masterful screenplay and translating on screen in the most engaging manner possible. Unlike this previous film 'Reservoir Dogs' which centered on a group of unhinged criminals in the aftermath of a jewelry store robbery, this film sees Tarantino expands upon his narrative scope with a slightly more lighthearted tone; though a relatively heavy amount of violence and four-letter words. The story sets in two hit-man played by former 'Grease' star John Travolta and the ever-popular Samuel L. Jackson as they are embark on their way to a mob hit while trading in some philosophical discussions consisting of clever pop culture references including the now-famous ""royale with cheese"". The rest of the dialogue consists of some snappy monologues and bold one-liners formulated by Tarantino's edgy script. Many of the characters, almost all of which are distinct archetypes with a morally gray area, embrace in Tarantino's nonlinear series of vignettes that all lead to moments of both shock and unexpected laughter, but with plenty of memorability. Among the wildly large ensemble cast, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are easily the duo is stand out. These two embrace such an engaging chemistry on their opening scene with their top-notch dialogue and darkly funny nature, and Travolta also claims an opportunity to establish a clever chemistry with Uma Thurman in a following storyline featuring Eric Scholtz as a drug dealer who must come to Travolta's aid when his date with Thurman goes awry. Bruce Willis gives a smart, but perhaps less memorable performance as an ailing boxer who faces a fateful encounter with Marcellis Wallace, played by Ving Rhames who plays the role in a solid fashion. Christopher Walken makes a brief appearance as a Vietnam War veteran in a flashback sequence, but doesn't have much offer beyond his few minutes of screen time. Maria De Medeiros as the girlfriend of Bruce Willis's character embraces a fine performance, but sadly is given a whole lot to do. One of the biggest surprise is Quentin Tarantino who makes a brash cameo as a friend of Samuel L. Jackson in one vignette set after the horrible carnage that ensues in Jackson and Travolta's mob hit. Finally, there is Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as the Bonnie and Clyde-like couple who explode on screen in an electrifying restaurant robbery leads to a sassy showdown, with semi-funny results. Pulp Fiction is a masterfully entertaining cinematic piece that marks not the best of Quentin Tarantino's efforts but by far one of the best films in cinematic history. It is a film overflowing with plenty of substance, solid performances, colorful dialogue, and a spectacular amount of cinematic surprises; although it's audacious humor and occasionally unpleasant nature can proved to be for offensive for some. In the end, it places Tarantino on the high ranks of Hollywood's ladder."
29 April 2019,quasimodo-26512,1,2,7,I did enjoy my second viewing!,"I watched this movie a few yrs ago and really didn't like it at all. I decided last evening to give it another try seeing all the great reviews that it was getting. Well to my surprise I must say I did enjoy it this time. It was rather long but overall it wasn't boring , also I found it quite humorous at times!!"
17 October 1999,RNMorton,0,1,9,"This has never been done, before or since","I'm not sure how Tarantino pulled this off, but he did, and he came up with one of the most unusual if not outstanding movies of the 90s. Free-form movie style eschews standard plot lines (and even plot sequencing!) in largely-unconnected story of two hit men and a boxer directed to take a dive.  Samuel L. Jackson is superb as Bible-quoting killer, with a nice comeback by Travolta.  Not for weak stomachs or those seeking a formula plot.  The kind of movie that spawns substandard imitations."
18 January 2002,dstuller1,8,20,4,Over hyped,"Half the people I know liked the movie, the other didn't.  I'm in the latter group. I'm not sure what it was that I missed that the first group picked up on, but I was bored with it. I felt it had a lot of lengthy, boring, scenes & dialog. I was unimpressed with the acting, not that it was bad but it just didn't grab me. I won't say not see it, but rather make up your own mind.Many in this group liked it so check it out, you may be in the first half I talked about."

3 February 2021,brandannunzio,1,2,10,Cinematic Sex,"This cult classic lives up to all the hype in an unstoppable rollercoaster of flirtatious violence and genre-bending action. Performances that have stood the test of time, in fact aged like a whiskey, continue to pay off as Tarantino shows the world what he's really made of.A rare 10. But worthy. Oh so worthy!"
13 August 2021,RonellSowes,0,1,9,It's Got Personality,"It's hard to separate the legend from the actual film and view Pulp Fiction objectively after the reputation that it has grown over the years; it astonished audiences on its release and continues to do so forever expanding its legions of fans. However it's best to watch Pulp Fiction ignoring all the praise and accolades as hard or impossible as that may be.Tarantino's wildly imaginative pastiche is a complete product of cinema that doesn't even pretend to exist in the world we do. If you can recognize that it makes some of its weaker moments more excusable, yet I might add that it's a little more uneven then some might let on it to be.Sure, Tarantino has his lines of dialouge and entire scenes that are amusing or memorable, but there's also a good number that almost make you cringe and certainly don't hold up to much scrutiny. However, like The Searchers-which contains some terrible moments that make you wonder if its the same movie-the better parts are good enough to make you overlook it's shortcomings.Pulp Fiction it isn't high-brow cinema, but its definetly a film. Every inch of it proudly says movie and it's a wholly unique, entertaining ride of a film that like dog, it has personality and that can go a long way."
29 June 2002,Caesaria,1,2,10,"Becomes the perfect movie after the fifth viewing, at least to me","The first time I watched this movie I was all of 13 or so, so it was difficult to appreciate.  Now, over time, it is a perfectly crafted entity, each scene a masterpiece.  Everyone knows when to arrive, what to say, how to squirm, and when to leave.  Flawless.  Quentin Tarantino is a genius, but Samuel L. Jackson is The Man, for now and forever."
3 September 2006,abum190,1,4,10,An undeniably great movie,"How Quentin Tarantino managed to pull this off is a mystery. Where he got these characters from is even more of a mystery. This movie is a celebration of all things trashy, and yet I got the feeling that when Tarantino started making this movie he realized he could make it so much more than that. He has a gold mine of character and dialogue here, and he has used it up and more.The best thing about this movie is its dialogue. Everything everyone says is so natural; you believe someone would say these things in real life. Every conversation is essential to the plot, but when they take place they feel spontaneous. Even sequences that would feel contrived under a lesser screenplay or lesser director feel perfect in this movie, such as the scene between Willis and the cabdriver, or the scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing at the restaurant.Not only are conversations natural, but the way events shape out feels like real life also. When we are expecting Mia and Vince to get on the good foot and do the bad thing, what we get instead is a crisis in which Mia almost dies. When we expect Butch to get killed, instead he does the killing. The movie felt like it was leading me in one direction but then led me in another, but I didn't feel gypped because it felt right.And the actors are something else in this movie. John Travolta did not give the performance I expected from him- I expected hammy Travolta and what I got was understated Travolta that fit into everything around him; definitely not what I expected. Sam Jackson has the most fun in this movie, but manages to keep it real at the same time. I can't even get into everyone else, simply because there are so many good performances.I gave the movie a 10 (something I've done for only three other movies) because it's so complete. I had trouble figuring out what the point of the movie is, and I'm still not sure, but it really doesn't matter. The stories are so intriguing and the characters are so engaging, I don't really care about the point of it all. I just want to see it again."
13 November 2007,ElijahCSkuggs,0,2,10,What else can be said?,"Tarantino's first huge film is PULP FICTION, a profane, multi-layered, character driven explosion of philosophizing hit men, drug overdoses, and leather bound gimps. Despite its long running time, this mash of story and action is nearly nil of bore and continually entertains with every viewing.Sam Jackson, arguably, has never been better; Travolta, ditto; Uma is good as always; Rhames, nearly mythical; Stoltz manages to make a drug dealer look like kind; Amanda Plummer is crazy; Keitel, calmly imposing; Alexis Arquette was still Robert Arquette; Bruce Willis, great as always.When it came out in the theaters, it was evident that Tarantino had created something like nothing else, and more than a decade later, scores of awful filmmakers still try to emulate this film's cool and fluid chaos.It's not my favorite Tarantino flick, but I won't argue if someone states that it's his best."
15 June 2008,marcin_kukuczka,0,2,7,Lurid Fiction and Movie Like Many Others and No Other,"Action films have become popular in the last few decades of cinema history. While among a considerable number of audience, these movies play a decisive role of entertainment, there are also people who claim that they are not very innovative due to the constant themes built upon murder and sex. Therefore, if you see PULP FICTION without much insight, you will surely have this impression: it is a movie of no linear content, so much filled with decadent aspects of murder, vulgarity, crimes, drug abuse and sex. However, having seen PULP FICTION in a more detailed way, you strangely realize that this movie is unique, stands on its own; in other words, you begin to realize that it is quite something.Since so many people have already discussed the content, it would be useless to analyze it now. I'd like to concentrate rather on something more extravagant and courageous for the reviewer: the intentions of the director and all the staff. These different but deadly vivid stories which strangely link the main characters together and which finally change the lives of some do not appear to be something extraordinary, moralistic, overwhelming and exceptionally convincing. They are simply a depiction of criminal life in American metropolis. This is life, not its ideal, its model but real life filled rather with decadence than virtue! The characters seem to follow the advice that Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) gives once to the boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) ""F*** ambition"" and fill their days with crimes, sex, and drugs. Yet, the very core of those events is a single moment affecting the future, affecting the mind, the universe of a reality. In this respect, the whole movie is a ""mosaic"" fiction of these single moments that seriously influence not only the events depicted but also the viewer's psyche, the viewer's thoughts.Thanks to obscene script and lurid stories but good performances, we are all led to the specific world of PULP FICTION. The viewer is intensely with Butch (Bruce Willis) in his ""Gold Watch"" sequence as well as with Vincent Vega (John Travolta) when he meets Mia (Uma Thurman) at Jack Rabbit Slims'. You may not agree with these fictitious decadent worlds, yet you have to accept them, absorb them, you have to shout ""I do not care for the rest"" when you decide to see PULP FICTION ... that is a particular power of the movie, something many other films of the genre are short of.If you ask me what moments I liked, I'll tell you something pretty unconventional but true: ""Ignore your perception of film for the time you watch this one!"" It's an entirely different movie called by some ""a movie of the mob."" It is Tarantino where you either love his moments or despise them. The ""Gold Watch"" story is terrific when a boxer becomes so much absorbed by the watch he got from his father. Can you imagine that value of historic gift the father gave to his son? He kept it even in the most ""taboo"" parts of his body. Butch-Fabienne moments are wonderfully hilarious and nicely sensual. I also liked Mia-Vincent meeting and her words about silence at the table. The final scene is very good, too. Is it a renewed shepherd? Perhaps an odd one but appealing one? What a look at God and faith!However, it seems crucial to state that PULP FICTION by Quentin Tarantino also has its serious dangers (perhaps it is even too leniently said). This is a movie where exaggeration and the lack of good taste are really present. For instance, the rape on Marsellus Wallace is a very disturbing moment. I also detested Mia's overdose and injection that she gets in the house of Vincent's drug dealing friend. Besides, I highly criticize the sequence ""The Bonnie Situation"" with the plot of one body - no head and the characters clean the blood flooded car from the parts of brain. This is Tarantino, you may justify. However, I am certain that there are lots of people who will rather concentrate on this facet expressing a strong criticism and no one, even people who consider PULP FICTION a masterpiece, cannot ignore that opposite viewpoint - the movie is filled with graphic violence.But of course, when watching PULP FICTION, you cannot skip one thing, certainly: the special mood so characteristic of Tarantino. It is something which, as I have mentioned before, many detest, but which allows you, as a viewer, to experience the movie, to watch it memorably even though it is filled with so much violence and disturbing visuals. Although Tarantino got worse in years, this is purely the very best example of his ""unspoiled"" individual vision. I'm not his fan but this aspect quite impressed me in PULP FICTION - to be able to invite a viewer to something pretty personal, powerful, and thought provoking.As disgusting as a murder for some, as pleasant as a foot massage for others... a movie on its own though a film like many others but, at the same time, a movie like no other: that's, I think, what best defines PULP FICTION with its strong and weak points"
15 November 2009,bryanus,1,2,10,Still works,"I think that I might have ruined this movie for myself. I watched this movie over and over, ad nauseum in my 20's. I think that parts of it are dated and should remain in the 90's vault, but I think that for the most part this movie is transcendent. For anyone who's ever read my other comments you'll know that my idea of a masterpiece is a movie that pulsates with a mystical otherworldly vibe, and I'd have to say that most of this movie is like that. This movie has been parodied by the likes of The Simpsons, and been referenced by serious critics, and for good reason. This movie definitely resonates with the archetypal sophomore vibe; while it doesn't have the innocence of Reservoir Dogs, or the maneuverability of the Kill Bill series, it definitely stands on its own. It is also one of the more charming, and highly appealing of the Generation X stoner flicks. Let me just say that if I could give this movie beyonder points, I'd give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. Great, great work."
17 October 2001,oz-44,1,1,10,A continuous stream of odd stories brilliantly sewn together.,"A continuous stream of odd stories brilliantly sewn together, this is the kind of films that places itself in the back of your brain. When you first watch it, the overwhelming amount of episodes and the fast dialogue leaves you dizzy, knowing that you have just seen one of modern cinemas true masterpieces. Details from ""Pulp Fiction"" are still popping into my head, six years after I first saw it."
24 February 2010,Stampsfightclub,0,1,9,Explosive original crime drama,"Two hit men are caught up in a life of religion and TV whilst their big time boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) has trouble with his trusted boxer.Almost 16 years old and Quentin Tarantino's hard hitting crime drama is still a fresh reminder of how to tackle a hard hitting crime picture.Technical ingenuity has moved on obviously since the nineties, only looking at other crime pictures such as Sin City shows how green screen and star power can produce results and yet here, a quickly shot low budget cult production has grossed millions and still tops numerous polls and it is down to its script and director and great collaboration of actors for doing so.Tarantino, better known then for his scripting for films such as True Romance and Natural Born Killers then, exploded into the film industry with this picture that glorifies violence, promotes hard drug use and defies bible connotations, and all the while being somehow light hearted and consistently original.The opening contemplation of restaurant robbery is certainly an idea never covered in any film I've ever seen and after a memorable credit sequence with fast rhythm we see the two main stars chatting on their way to a confrontation. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson make a true great pair of hit men who are simply chilling and talking about burgers and TV pilot shows and the eventual emergence of what they are about to do evaporates on the screen. Jackson's bible speech and his converse with the group of guys is brilliant scene stealing bravery and power.When the cannons of the gun are unloaded the film literally explodes in an array of flinching violence and directional mastery from Tarantino and when we remerge at this story later on from the film, the subject of violence gets a thorough working.When studying media a few years ago this was often a big reference to the emergence of on screen violence. Looking at it now 16 years from release it is perhaps soft-core contrasted to many modern horror flicks and the odd crime film with Tarantino developing into more apparent bloodshed, especially in Kill Bill. But whilst we have uncomfortable drug overdoses and brutal target practice the film does not sidetrack its way from delivering a story with real life purpose and intelligence.With a good soundtrack and useful collaboration of artistic shots, especially Travolta after shooting up in the car, this has Tarantino on artistic but down to earth.The little things make the big memory. The scene in the restaurant when Travolta and Thurman are conversing about comfortable silences and milkshakes, the hidden agenda of store workers in Willis' story, and that initial story of restaurant robbery all collate in a way that is energetic, funny and powerful meaning. Whilst many say Tarantino continues to improve, I maintain this is his most original and quotable film that will simply never age and be continued to be enjoyed for many years."
15 October 2009,TorontoLiver,1,2,10,This Quentin Tarantino Masterpiece is One of the BEST Movies Ever Made,"This movie without a doubt is on of the greatest movies I ever seen. The characters are amazing, the dialogue is twisted and hilarious, and the experience is just unreal! The movie's main characters are a foolish hit-man named Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta), his intelligent pal Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel Jackson)who's also a hit-man, but smarter and crazier, a vicious boxer (Bruce Willis), the mob boss Marcellus (Ving Rhames), his sexy wife Mia (Uma Thurman) and two diner robbers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer). Vincent and Jules are two friends who kill some people, and talk about things together. Vincent is asked by Marsellus to take Mia out to dinner and Vincent insists it's not a date. You bet your ass it's a date! Mia and Vincent made a real connection, then after dinner they both go to her house. Vincent goes to the bathroom, and Mia listens to music on the stereo and finds Vincent's drugs. Mia's a cocaine addict and snorts coke when she thinks no one is looking. Vincent's bag of drugs actually isn't coke, it's heroin! She takes a little of this up the nose, overdoses, and nearly died as a result. Thank God Vincent came to save her. There's more to this film, WAY more, but I'm not spoiling the rest for you. You go see the movie.The movie is excellent, but definitely not for everyone. The f-word is used 265 times! I didn't count, I read it on the Internet somewhere. There are endless references to hard drugs, and sex is spoken about between Jules and Vincent. The film is too good to describe. Watch it today, but don't bring your kids."
7 April 2000,mrcchief,6,16,3,Very Overrated!!,"I saw this movie when it was first released and I still don't understand how so many people love this movie.  Travolta is nothing special, Bruce Willis was a stiff, and the whole concept of this movie seemed ridiculous to me. Sam Jackson was great as playing a typical Sam Jackson Role. I think everyone was on a Tarantino rush because he wore those kangol hats. Who Cares!!? Reservoir Dogs wasn't good either.  Maybe I'm just anti tarantino but in no way is this one of the greatest films of all time or even the 1990's."
21 June 2003,live_and_direct_at_network23,1,2,10,Best of the best,"This is one of my top 3 movies of all time.There is a lot more going on in this movie than most people see. (Even those who think they know what this movie is about. Most don't.) There is a whole secret plot to the movie. There are 3 witnesses (Marvin, Jules & Vincent) to an event. Marvin's death is key. (""Man, I don't even know...."" Then bang, he's dead.) The second witness, Vincent Vega, denies his experience, and ""bang!"" He's also dead. Only Jules lives. There is so much symbolism and hidden messages you have to see it a few dozen times to start putting it together. Here's a good place to get a clue: Check out the name of the chopper. Now think about the final scene between Butch and Marsellus Wallace. Between Jules and Ringo. This movie is funny, provoking, challenging, and multilevel. It can also be life changing event, just like it was for Jules. The violence and language are rough, but everyone over 13 should see this movie. Then think about what you saw and heard."
12 February 2002,SmileysWorld,0,2,10,Beyond Words,"This film is absolutely breath taking.It's unique approach to story telling and cinematography is just beyond words.I do admire films that dare to be different and stretch beyond the comfort zones of the typical movie lovers out there.It definitely deserves its place on the AFI's 100 greatest films.It's funny yet violent at the same time, and that is something I thought I would never see in a film.Definitely a must see,must rent,must own movie.Thumbs up!"
9 July 2003,ndrwdyng71,1,2,10,Possibly one of the greatest of all time,"Pulp Fiction is brilliant in almost every shot, every line of dialogue. Tarantino really filled this film with some wonderful touches, the quirky and profane dialogue, truly outlandish situations, and larger-than-life characters.  You can tell that he really loves film--it just seems like the guy loves making movies and wants his audience to have fun, too.The thing that really sends this film above and beyond others is the human heart beating at the center of this very rough film.  In Vincent, Jules, Mia, and Butch, we have a cast of characters who approach the world with a definite sense of irony and cynicism.  Yet, Tarantino tempers these sharper elements with some genuine human emotion: love, longing, and the desire for redemption.  Highly reccomended."

11 April 2022,steiner-sam,0,1,9,It's almost a parody of film noir,"It's almost a parody of film noir, set in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and follows the violent interactions of six sets of people.Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) are two robbers who are finding liquor stores more problematic and consider robbing a coffee shop. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) are hitmen that work for the gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Marsellus has a beautiful young wife, Mia (Uma Thurman). Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging boxer who works for Marsellus and has been ordered to throw a fight. His love is Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros). We also meet Vincent's drug dealer, Lance (Eric Stoltz), married to Jody (Rosanna Arquette). And then there are the guys in the pawnshop, Maynard (Duane Whitaker) and Zed (Peter Greene).The film includes racism, violence, homosexual rape, drug overdoses, a distortion of Ezekiel 25:17, more violence, more violence, and even a little redemption at the end. The dialogue is obscene and outrageous while being memorable. The chemistry between Travolta and Jackson is incredible, aided by the great script. Uma Thurman and Maria De Medeiros are spot on in their roles. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis, but the role was made for him. Even Ving Rhames' character is memorable.The fact that the film does not unfold chronologically strengthens the impact. So it's all to say, this is one well-made move, though not to everyone's taste."
27 June 2001,lauraholt_pi,13,43,1,Gave it a '1' because they wouldn't let me select '0' BAD,"Totally sickening, no redeeming value to the human condition. Why not study the uplifting people in the world instead of getting a view through the eyes of the most degenerate, disgusting and completely perverted few. The more glimpses they show into the lives of the debase people of the world the more debase our world becomes."
5 March 2004,agmoldham,0,3,8,Tarantino's finest Hour,"This is Tarantino's best film to date. Since bursting onto the scene with Reservoir Dogs Tarantino has been idolised by many of the 'serious' movie going population. Whilst some of his films have been over hyped there's no doubting that Pulp is an extremely impressive movie.The movie follows several characters interactions during a (approx) 24 hour period. The time switches backwards and forwards with each scene, so the first time you watch it you will busily be working out the chronological story.   Most of the cast turn in excellent performances and it seems a bit of a shame to highlight anybody. There's many scenes that are spell-binding throughout the movie. 9/10"
18 January 2020,statman122,2,13,5,Most overrated film of all time,"A lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me. The only performance of note here is Keitel's, and even that is far from his best work.
Jumping around the time line may make it look ""smart"" to mellenials, but I still don't get why Tarantino is such a big deal. He is an unoriginal hack, who uses the same handful of parlor tricks repeatedly."
25 March 2017,MihaiSorinToma,0,1,8,A big over-appreciation,"The lives of several characters with a different background intersect in four separate stories, told in an unique way. It's a type of movie you don't encounter often, judging by the cast that it has, the dialog it features and even the way it presents its action.It's a movie which presents its plot in a very unusual way (separating it into 4 different but somehow related sequences), in a very explicit way, both dialogue and action, with some highly experienced and very expressive actors which simply shine, creating an one of a kind atmosphere which makes you feel like you're part of the action, keeping you entertained and even amused like myself throughout its whole length.I acknowledge the quality of this movie, but, and this is a huge but, I simply do not understand the overall hype which surrounds it, the huge mass of fans and lovers of it and thus, the final rating it has overall. As I said before, I know it is a quality product, but I also have to say that from my point of view, it is very much over-appreciated. The plot itself is quite disappointing, presenting a series of events which ultimately intertwine but which do not carry a high level of interest, meaning or even depth. To be frank, the plot is quite lame. What makes it apparently shine are the actors which do a flawless job, but by itself, it's a mediocre set of stories. Furthermore, the satisfaction it gives throughout and even in the end is quite below average I must say. It indeed kept me entertained and made me laugh quite a lot, but this is not enough to make it a masterpiece as almost everybody say it is. If you put it into another perspective, it's just a movie full of violence an foul language which actually gives more F words than transmitting something deep through its plot.It is without doubt a good movie, but its level of fame and acclaim by the audience simply puzzles me."

19 August 2014,manitobaman81,0,1,7,Good,"Welcome to the world of Pulp Fiction, where dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks and violent dogs are barking everywhere. It's a world where the only thing that keeps lives afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationships on display. Against this backdrop, our heroes must fight. Pulp Fiction is one of those roller-coasters that is both a joy and a trial to watch. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Original and unforgettable to the tenth degree."

                        ",Tarantino at his best,"This movie was just great. It was one of Tarantinos earlier movies and one of his best. It has an awesome cast Samuel L. Jackson , Bruce Willis, John Travolta, the list goes on and on. This is a great action with a lot of humor mixed in with it.The lives of two moberster hit men, a boxing champ, a vicious gangsters wife and a pair of restaurant robbers intertwine in four tales of violence and redemtion.This is a really good movie. It is some what old but can definitely hold its own. The acting is really good and the script is phenomenal. The story line is very cool and this movie was a popular thing to spin off for years to come. Very good movie watch this"
18 October 2014,petarmatic,0,1,8,I watched it few times again and again!,"When I saw this film the first time I went wit my mother to see it. She said after we watched it:"" I do not understand this at all. I did not like this film!"" I have to say that argument ensued, because I liked it very much. Actually, when I saw it that time I thought it is a masterpiece. I still think that way, although after so many years have passed I think some of the famous lines from the film were and are still quoted and used too many times in many shows and other films for that matter.There is nothing much I can add about plot, famous lines, acting, which was already said about all of this. Except that I second all the things said about great things which were achieved by this original script and acting. With this film, film making was moved one inch forward if not many more. Great!"
14 December 2005,pinkpanther3394,13,35,1,Tarantino smells bad,"A very good movie this is,but one sees overtime that Pulp Fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time. Tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own. This may be a great movie but no, though Tarantino's film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time. Good, Tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic, arrogant, loquacious,bad man. What I mean is I wouldn't spend my time with Tarantino, not so much because I don't like him, but because I can't stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phonies."
6 January 2019,elicopperman,0,2,10,Tarantino's Magnum Opus,"Quentin Tarantino remains as one of the most unique modern filmmakers. The films he's directed are known for their nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, overabundance of violence, punchy dialogue, pop culture references and songs from the 60s to the 80s. So in order to find the one that embraces it all, look no further than his most beloved feature, Pulp Fiction. Made as a tribute to film-noir comics and pulp magazines, the film won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival the same year it was released. With that said, many consider this to be Tarantino's magnum opus, and I definitely agree.The plot itself is divided into thee different segments that are told in non chronological order. The first one details mob hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), whom share their own philosophical discussions with one another. Their story is intertwined with their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman). The second one details struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and his loved one Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros). And the third one details Vince and Jules fixing a murder problem with master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and encountering an anxious robber couple, ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer). With all of these storylines around, the film works based on what happens to each character. The mystery angle is played as each narrative comes afloat, making the viewing experience shockingly suspenseful.Since this film is well known for the character interactions, it's no brainer that the dialogue is extensive, charismatic, snappy and heavily intriguing. Each character has their own personal views on life and other subjects that make one ponder a lot, especially Jules, as his arch becomes quite theoretical to the point of wanting him to make ease with himself. I think my personal favorite storyline revolves around Butch, since the macguffin behind his tough guy persona is what ends up driving his arch forward the most. In addition to having such a bittersweet life waiting for him, all the crap that happens to the guy always has me worried about his well being. The funny thing is, we don't know what will ever happen to most of the characters. Many of their arches just sort of conclude without a resolution, which appropriately displays the uncertainty of what will become of them to keep the audience wondering.There's no denying how much this film makes use of its relatively small budget, and it looks amazing. The usage of camera angles, fast paced editing, lighting and panning really help elevate the already unpredictable flow that the movie set in stone. The cinematography by Andrzej Sekula successfully recreates the gritty underground homage to the hardboiled crime novels that inspired the feature. Not to mention, while there is no original score, the film makes heavy usage of the rock & roll and pop soundtrack that Tarantino loves to showcase in his work. Depending on the situation, any of the recordings are very crucial to the postmodern pizazz that the film established. Several films have been built around already existing songs like The Blues Brothers and Yellow Submarine, and this film is no exception; it utilized them wonderfully through style and substance.Even though Reservoir Dogs was Tarantino's directorial debut, I think this film took what was good and bad about that feature and kicked it up to eleven. Pulp Fiction is a fantastically well crafted crime flick that took the genre to new heights that were never before achieved back then. Many filmmakers have tried and failed to recreate the magic of this film's versatility, but of course, you can never truly recapture lighting in a bottle like that again. Given that this year makes the feature's 25th anniversary, I think you should do yourself a favor and give it a watch if you're yet to see it yourself. It might surprise you for better or worse, but the shear experience of it will never leave your mind."
16 June 2020,xxwang-51947,1,2,7,not bad,"All in all, this is a not bad movie with a unique style, perhaps a pioneer in style in that era"
21 August 2021,SPZMaxinema,0,1,10,This can only work out of order!,"I've watched this movie in order and it is not the same. The soundtrack, the cultural and situational dialogue, and the dramatic twists and turns make this movie one of the best of all time. Tarantino breaks through officially with this masterpiece!!"
14 October 2019,Blue-Grotto,0,2,10,play with matches and you get burned,"You may also be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. Perhaps both. The very lucky and the very unlucky characters of Pulp Fiction experience such a roller coaster ride in the underworld of Southern California.Uncomfortable silences, philosophical hit men, foot massages, bible verses (Ezekiel 25:17), gourmet burgers, dance contests, furious vengeance, forgetful girlfriends, fixed boxing matches, pigs with personality and expensive milkshakes combine in this zany, violent, surprising, enthralling and quotable film. It is one of my favorites.One of the best things about Pulp Fiction is the intriguing and realistic conversations between characters. The banter is as natural, funny and fantastic as the characters themselves. It is like I was plopped right into real-life discussions. The soundtrack is wonderful too. It is as offbeat and eccentric as the film itself. Pulp Fiction helped my Brazilian friend Luiz Lourenço, who watched it with me, to learn English and - of course - experience a proper introduction to American culture. Samuel Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta (for once in his life), Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel are fantastic here. I had such a good time when I first watched it that I wished it wouldn't end."
29 September 2001,pf-matt,1,2,10,"If you liked ""Reservoir Dogs"" you will love ""Pulp Fiction""","This is my favorite movie ever!  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make the perfect team.  Plus with having some of the cast from ""Reservoir Dogs"" made the movie even better.  I heard Director Quentin Tarantino almost made this movie in black and white and had his friends play all the parts.  Thank Harvey Keitel for that not happening because once he read over the script he helped Quentin Tarantino make it a low budget film.  They only spent around $5 to $6 million making this film. Anyways the acting is great and this is a must see film and so is ""Reservoir Dogs"" so go see that too! Same director ""Quentin Tarantino"" and the plot is great.  I give ""Pulp Fiction"" 9.0 out of 10 stars. Go see it if haven't yet!"
24 May 2006,Bogmeister,0,2,9,"Lurid-yes, Talky-sure, Creative-Absolutely, Medieval-Maybe","It's difficult to describe Tarantino's concoction in just one paragraph or even one page - there is a denseness to it all, an intricate weave - and even though I've seen it well over a couple of times, I'm still unsure of what the next scene will be the next time I view it. That's a tribute to the plotting - this isn't a typical script, that fer sure. Many will come away from it recalling all the gabbing done by the characters - this is an indulgence of Tarantino's we are all familiar with. It's unconventional if the goal is to produce a smooth pace; the action begins, then there's a lengthy monologue or debate which should impede everything. Most of the dialog is at least cutesy-clever, but those sections are not my favorite parts of the film. There were a couple of scenes where I thought, jeez-louise I guess Quentin's not into judicious editing when it starts to drag past the 3-minute mark of the same two characters yakking away. The dialog must be sacred to him - OK, I can dig it. And hey, I'm not referring to cutting down Chris Walken's one scene, where it's understood he had to go through an entire history of a certain watch for us to understand its importance.No, for me, the great thing about all this are the plot turns in the fiction. If you're watching it for the first time, you may think you know where a scene is heading, mostly based on your past experience of watching movies. But this is a pulp novel masquerading as a movie. This isn't the movie you and your father have seen, many times over. This is, to put it mildly, unpredictable. You may think you know where Travolta's and Thurman's characters are heading to on their date, but...no, there's just no way to predict what actually happens. You may think you know what will happen to Willis's character as he returns to his apartment when he shouldn't...well, actually, by this point in the film you may not be so sure. By this point, you're probably wondering what insane twist Tarantino plans to throw at you; and, holy ma-golly, doesn't it really get insane? I don't think this can be conveniently labeled as pulpy lurid fiction, more psychotronic.This film was a starting point for many things and a turning point in film history. Travolta had his comeback; Jackson was now a made man; Willis showed he wasn't just a Moonlighting/Die Hard bozo; well, hell, the entire cast benefited - including Greene as Zed, a hard-to-forget impression in a small role. For the rest of the nineties, we were besieged by Pulp Fiction wannabee movies trying to capture the spirit of a new film term - Tarantinesque. Of course, none of them did."
21 July 2020,Titansfan02,5,12,2,I must be missing something,I have no idea why everyone loves this movie so much. It was loosely held together and really just disappointing for a movie that gets talked up so much
2 February 2002,franklynbob,1,2,10,one of the best of the nineties,"This is an amazing film.  Reservoir Dogs was more violent and gritty. Jackie Brown was more stylish.  This is a perfect mix of both.The film's music plays an important role in establishing a large part of it's style that's not made from the clothing, dialogue or violence.  Notice how there is never a CD playing.  The music is played on car radios, records, etc.  I actually didn't know whether or not the film took place in the 90's or the 70's the first time I watched it.  I had to go back and look for date elements (cars, cigarettes, etc.).The dialogue is very witty, and it gets a lot of its points from is observations.  ""Awkward pauses"", ""coming back from the bathroom with your food waiting for you"".  I think that Tarantino's most valuable talent is his ability to observe human behaviours.The narrative construction is another note.  I liked the way the film was cut up.  But it's important that the construction benefits the film, rather than trying to hide its weak spots, like some other films do.  I think that Tarantino was walking a fine line between cutting edge filmaking and exploitation, and crossing the line of having too much of everything.I think people need to realize that this film is at first a comedy.  We can't take it seriously.  Some of the events are probably very true to the crime life, but they're handled in a way that make the film live in another world.  Obviously the film is not reality.I also think that people get upset about the violence, which if you think about it, takes place mostly off-screen.  So it could be taken as praise by Tarantino, making people think they're seeing more violence than is actually there.I could go on for hours writing.  I've come up with a religious theory about the film too.  How Marcellus waves his hand at Butch after he rescues Marcellus from the rapists in an almost absolving manner.  The Biblical passage.  How we are left with the feeling that Vince and Jules are the winners when they casually walk out of the diner at the end of the film, until we remember that Vince was killed about 45 minutes earlier in the film and that this scene is actually taking place before that.  Vince laughs at Jules in the coffee shop when he says he's done, he's out of the crime life, and then after laughing at him, gets killed when he (Vince) decides to continue with the life.I think that both the critics are the fans of this film should look a little closer, to realize that it's not as one-dimensional as they may think.The only negative effect this film has had on me is the amount of post-Tarantino rip-offs there have been.  There's a difference between being influenced by a film and just trying to copy it.  Too many new film makers are making flash-bang films, without Tarantino's talent to be able to pull it off."
19 January 2020,ohasar-18230,1,1,10,Great Movie!,"Pulp Fiction is a great movie, it takes everything you know about movies, and throws it away and it absolutely works! The cast is amazing, the scrip is one of the best ever written and in the first time you watch it you may not understand the timeline of the movie but it's pretty complicated but if you're watching the movie carefully, you will understand the timeline and everything just like i did, I totally recommend this movie to anyone beyond the ago of 14, I know it's rated R but kids after the ago of 14 will totally understand what's happening, but you must be mature enough to watch this movie, there are a lot of intense scenes in the movie."

6 December 2014,thomasroffe,6,10,10,One of the Greatest Dialogues for One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob boss's wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson. The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to ""read between the lines"", if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a straight up entertaining film which you don't even need to watch all the way through once you've watched it a few times. This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List."

5 January 2022,jdring2007,0,1,10,"indelible scenes, characters, and script, even extended dialogue flows with charisma and chemistry; exceptional storytelling","What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? It's one of my all-time favorites for obvious reasons, entire scenes memorized, but I must say that in rewatchings of it I very often skip nearly half the movie to better enjoy my favorite parts. The more action oriented ones. That said, complete viewings, from beginning to end, have their obvious merit; the direction, cinematography, set pieces, costumes, even the smallest mannerisms of characters are all so exceptional that it often feels like you're watching real life. But it isn't. There are so many things clearly destined for the big screen, and the exaggeration that is film, that their stitching together is an amazing convenience to watch unfold. From the nonlinear narrative to the bursts of violence, the emotive dialogue, stupendous music selection, and clever humor, it really is an ace in the hole. Absolute favorites for me were Travolta as Vincent, making even the ""lesser"" scenes such as the dancing sequence still compelling. And then there's Bruce Willis as Butch, portraying so much through so few words. Altogether though everyone nails their part, right down to ""the little guys."""

28 April 2020,Simon-jensen,1,1,10,"One of the best movies, of its time","Pulp Fiction is an all time favorite for me, and one of the best movies of the 90's. All the small stories playing along and being bound together in the end.And I really like how Tarantino are building up the story in a both serious and fun way, at the same time. Good entertainment all the way."
22 April 1999,PIST-OFF,0,1,9,A work of genius.,"I like Reservoir Dogs so much more than Pulp Fiction it's not even funny. There's lots of movies I like a lot more then Pulp Fiction but I can't say they're better than it. It's just as full of great lines and great actors in great scenes as Reservoir Dogs but the whole symbolical thing with this movie is what makes people love it more. I kind of hate the over flow of Tarantino style movies coming out since Pulp Fiction but a few manage to be good. All actors and actresses involved put in career bests with the exception of Keitel, Roth, and Buscemi, who were all better in Reservoir Dogs. Killer soundtrack is a must for anyone who likes this movie. Read the screenplay to find a variation on Marvin's death."
4 March 2005,Johnny0581,1,3,10,Coolest movie ever!,"What can I say...my favorite movie until I saw this one was Mortal Kombat...lol I have to admit that when I was younger and I saw this movie, I didn't think it was all that, in fact, I found it long and boring. I guess at that age, I must've been about 14, I wanted to see more action, more blood, and all that simple stuff that you're attracted to as a young teenager. Now that i'm 23, and more grown up, and actually care about the movies' plots and story lines, depending if the movie is supposed to be taken seriously, I say this movie is a masterpiece that will never be equaled by any other! Pulp Fiction is great from start to finish. Tarantino's idea of showing the movie cropped up in different episodes and have them scrambled all over the movie in the same order he wrote the script I think it's great. It shows his creative genius as a screenwriter and how he can make the movie makes sense in the end, and it's good brain candy for the viewer. Now on to the characters: Sam Jackson's Jules has to be hands down my favorite movie character of all time. His coolness is hardly matched by any other character in movie history, and it's only complimented by John Travolta's character and partner in the movie, Vincent Vega. Although Vincent Vega in my opinion is way less cool and dumber and more annoying, Travolta does a great job playing Vega. Ving Rhames as Marcellus Wallace is great as well, playing the fearsome mobster, who the entire movie revolves around. Bruce Willis is great as an aging boxer who follows his instinct and honors his blood by refusing to throw a boxing match, angering Marcellus Wallace who earlier in the movie, tried to convinced him he's washed up and should do it. Uma Thurman is perfect and sexy as Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia, and her screen time with Travolta is nothing short of Hollywood gold. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Harvey Keitel, as Winston Wolf, the man who solves ""problems"" and who thinks fast, talks fast, and drives very f-'in fast so you better keep up. He is a delight to watch, especially when seen opposite Travolta's character Vincent, who in the movie tests his cool with one of his usual smart-ass comments. Keitel really commands the screen when he's on it and while he's on it steals the spotlight away from Jackson and Travolta. Quentin Tarantino, making a brief appearance as Jules friend Jimmy is pretty good too, not great but pretty good and funny as well, but I still rather see Tarantino behind the camera than in front of it. Eric Stoltz, hilarious as Lance the dope dealer, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as diner robbers Pumpkin and Hunny Bunny, great as well and everybody else, even Mad TV's Phil LaMarr in a very brief appearance as one of Vincent and Jules' victims. Every single line in this movie is worth listening to and being quoted in endless websites because the dialogue is the best in recent movie history, yes, there's lots of profanity, but that's what Tarantino wants us to see, that his characters' dialogue is just like yours and mine and they talk about the same stuff you and I talk about on our way to work and quote the same TV or movie characters you and me do. That and of course the music, every single song they play in this movie perfectly fits the mood of every scene and that's what make those songs stick in your head for days. This movie deserved all the Golden Globes, Palm D'or, and Oscars it won. A true 90's classic! 10 out of 10"

                        ",A piece of movie history- a must watch for action fans.,"Quentin Tarantino burst on the scene with Reservoir Dogs and with Pul Fiction he cemented his place among the most exciting directors to watch. Like every other film of his this one contains memorable scenes, memorable dialogues and characters and an execution which can easily be identified as ""Tarantinoesque"". The film plays non-chronologically and involves two hitmen, a boxer, a mobster's wife and a diner. Each and every actor is amazing, so much so that you cannot imagine anyone else in the role. Travolta is especially good- no wonder this was a resurrection of sorts for the famed actor who was previously known for his dancing numbers. Populated by the Tarantino stock of actors who are seen in his films Pulp Fiction is a very good film that deserves to be seen."
22 June 2003,departed07,0,2,10,Quentin's Masterpiece is still a classic!,"Pulp Fiction changed the way how movie buffs go to the movies; at first we had ""The Godfather"" in which it dealt with how organized crime was run, then ""Taxi Driver"" which showed how people can never figure out what is wrong with an individual; In ""Pulp Fiction,"" what Quentin Tarantino manages to capture is how life itself is a comic book and how it affects everybody in life.The film's prologue begins with a dialog conversation between Pumpkin(Tim Roth) and Hunny Bunny(Amanda Plummer) about robberies in various places: banks, liquor stores, gas stations, etc., except that nobody ever bothers robbing a restaurant for which they are insured and that customers carry a lot of cash. After the Prologue, we are introduced to two different characters; Jules Winfeld (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who are hit men in search of a briefcase by their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) after being held hostage by a group of wanna-be gangsters that suffer the consequences after failing to answer questions by Jules.The second part of the story is concentrated on John Travolta's character Vincent, as a heroin user, he buys drugs off his buddy Lance(Eric Stoltz)and has to take the boss's wife Mia Wallace(Uma Thruman) out to dinner in which Vincent is uncomfortable at first until Mia forces her guest to dance with her, and that is when both characters become attracted to each other(not literary, but more like friends). After dinner, they both go back to Mia's house where she is wearing Vincent's coat and notices the heroin in his jacket and mistakes it for cocaine. Now to get his boss's girlfriend alive, Vincent seeks the help of Lance in which he tells Vincent to force a needle in her heart in order to stay alive. (I'll leave the next part for you to discover).The third story is the most weakest in my opinion, involving Bruce Willis's character Butch Coolidge, a boxer who made a bargain with Marcellus that if he loses, he gets to leave with $100,000. Unfortunately the plan backfires leaving Butch and his girlfriend on the run from the gangsters; which makes it more possible since his girlfriend forgot the watch that his father used in the war. Now with little time, Butch goes back to his apartment to get the watch and escapes from peril and sees Marcellus on the street. As Butch is trying to escape, Marcellus follows him into a pawn shop where they are capture by racist rednecks that have their fun with Marcellus...I won't be giving out anymore clues to what happens, but let me assure the readers out there, Pulp Fiction is one hell of a ride. The film not only is a Renascence towards bringing back actors such as John Travolta, but it brought a new career out of Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thruman, and the director himself, Quentin Tarantino. Backed up with a great soundtrack, and numerous references to great movies, TV Shows and the world, Pulp Fiction is a classic by my book."
19 May 2000,action-6,0,1,10,A marvellous movie,"Pulp Fiction is Tarantino`s second movie, and it is even better than Reservoir Dogs.  Pulp Fiction has stars like John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson, all those actors in a low-budget gangster movie. Tarantino`s script is fantastic, with lots of great characters, weird situations, great dialogue and violence. Pulp Fiction brought Travolta`s carreer back on track, and its easy to see why.  Travolta does a marvellous job as the gangster Vincent Vega.  All(most of) the actors are great in this movie. 10/10"
16 December 2016,Cinemaniac1984,0,1,9,There will never be another movie like Pulp Fiction.,"1994 was an excellent year for movies and Pulp Fiction stands proudly as one of the best movies of 1994. In fact, Pulp Fiction was one of the best movies of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino who wrote and directed this masterpiece will always be remembered for Pulp Fiction.Pulp Fiction is a non-linear journey which interweaves numerous tales involving hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), feared mob boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), petty criminals Ringo, aka ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), and Yolanda, aka ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob a diner, fixer Winston ""The Wolf"" Wolfe (Harvey Kietel), drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) and in a small but pivotal role Captain Koons (Christopher Walken).There's more to Pulp Fiction that meets the eye. Apart from the fact this was a highly influential movie as well as still being a popular movie over 20 years later, Pulp Fiction can be credited for simultaneously launching and reviving many careers. It goes without saying that Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino had successfully made his mark in Hollywood and continues to be an influential powerhouse. John Travolta's career was in the doldrums and the memories of his roles in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978) were fast becoming a distant memory before Pulp Fiction revived his career following a string of box office flops. Samuel L. Jackson who was well known as a character actor in a variety of movies including Coming to America (1988), Sea of Love (1989) and Goodfellas (1990) had finally made his well deserved big break. Uma Thurman was catapulted into the A-list. Bruce Willis was also a box office superstar however his career was harmed with a string of critical and commercial box office failures. And last but not least character actor Ving Rhames earned himself many more supporting roles in movies such as Mission: Impossible (1996) and Con Air (1997).Pulp Fiction has always maintained a reputation for being a violent and foul mouthed movie with over 265 uses of the f... throughout the entire 2 and 1/2 hours. People can't say that they weren't warned.Regardless of whatever Quentin Tarantino does throughout his career, Pulp Fiction will always be his best movie. The rest of the cast can proudly boast that Pulp Fiction was a highlight for their respective careers. And to this day, Pulp Fiction is still one of the best movies of the 90's and still remains to be a very popular movie of all time.9/10."
28 October 2015,junkmailmsm,2,4,7,"Great movies, Must watch.","Tarantino does it again! From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! The plot and dialog is so edgy and griping that I never wanted the movie to end. The only down side was all the story's in the movies where out of order which I know added to the suspense to the movie, but it also made it a little hard to follow and keep straight. Bruce Willies gives a great performance along side Samuel L Jackson, and John Travolta. A star studded cast that delivers as good as this one is bound to stand the test of time. I for one cannot wait to see what Tarantino comes out with next!"
20 March 2022,emicastroamador,1,1,9,Buena Película,"Tarantino creo lo que posiblemente es el inicio para aquellos que nos interesa el cine que va mas allá de lo comercial. Adoro esta película por ser de las primeras que he visto de manera seria en mi vida, y por la maravillosa creación de personaje que hay en ella."
5 August 2013,Al_The_Strange,0,1,9,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.""","Pulp: the word itself conveys a sense of roughness, grittiness, blood and gore, and some serious edge. Pulp fiction refers to a type of literature printed on cheap wood pulp paper, often telling violent or offensive stories. The film Pulp Fiction recycles the style and content of the pulp magazines of old, to produce a fresh new series of bloody crime sagas. Pulp Fiction is very liberal with its violence - going so far as having good guys, bad guys, and innocent bystanders getting shot up without any legal consequences. The film is also very liberal with its bad language - there are F-bombs and sexual dialogue galore. Parts of the film are pretty shocking. Make no mistake, there is definitely a lot of pulp in Pulp Fiction.Beneath its blood-soaked surface, the film can be surprisingly light and upbeat, thanks to its playfully witty dialogue and constant stream of ironic situations. It is a comedy at its core - not a comedy that ever makes me laugh out loud per se, but there are plenty of memorable and amusing lines throughout. Above all, it's just funny the way things turn out in this film. Seemingly unrelated characters run into each other, crazy stuff happens, and the outcome can be quite surprising at times.That being said, I've always felt this film has a pretty weird and random series of stories. It's a series of nested short stories - one story starts, then another, then another, then it goes back to the previous one, until finally connecting back to the scene in the film's opening. The narrative is purposefully mixed-up, jumping around a few different characters with their own situations, which ultimately connects to each other. Each story is pretty interesting though: the bulk of the film focuses on a pair of hit men, who terrorize and murder some dudes to retrieve a mysterious briefcase. This story is ultimately interrupted by the next, in which one of the hit men takes the crime boss' wife out, and interesting occurrences take place (including some of the awesomest dancing ever). My favorite of the lot is the episode involving the golden watch, in which a boxer tries to flee from town to evade the boss' wrath, but has to go back to retrieve his father's pocket watch. Crazy things ensue. The film's last stretch returns to the briefcase situation, in which even crazier things ensue, and the characters contemplate the greater meaning of everything that's happened.There is a method to the madness, and it works sublimely. With constant biblical references and quotes, the film digs up some subtle themes regarding life and morality. The entire film illustrates the futility of a life of crime; only a few characters escape unscathed, thanks to whatever redemption they manage to find for their wrongdoings, but most everybody else suffers a tragic end from their own wrongdoings. In the end, I felt this film underscored a strong message about living the good life, especially in the shadow of organized crime (which is effectively demonized). Jules says it the best when he says, ""The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm trying', Ringo. I'm trying' real hard to be the shepherd."" This film uses pretty solid photography and interesting editing. I feel it captures the ambiance of the locales extremely well. Acting is strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman are all striking in their respective roles. Writing shows excellent wit, with its plethora of great lines and conversation, and great nuance, with its plotting and narrative. This production has very real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is really hip too.Pulp Fiction is a pretty weird and violent animal of a film, but it seems to get better the more I see it. If you can stomach the pulp, then it's certainly a must-see.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"

                        ",Pure Artistry.,"Imagine for a second, an eccentric filmmaker pitching an idea for a movie with three different story lines that all merit excitement and violence, except there's one catch...take all the ""action shots"" out of the picture and keep the rest of the unnecessary fodder behind and that's the movie. The result of that unusual requested visions happened to be a unique, interesting, and original movie. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction defines itself as a distinctive film that will amuse, shock, and hold the audience in suspense. Tarantino crafted his work in the mid- 90s, a time when originality was lacking in film industry, everything had a formula that had to followed to be considered a technically ""good"" movie. Roger Ebert claimed, ""there are film classes, computer programs, and websites telling exactly how a movie should be made."" The result of that is losing the one thing that movies are supposed to about: artistic expression. So what did Tarantino do? He showed the industry that every artist has their own voice. There shouldn't be collated, specific formula, because then the audience has the industry solved and rings out all magic is left to be discovered. In Pulp Fiction took three overplayed story lines and made us watch the ""awkward"" scenes. What we wouldn't see in other movies, the time in between the action. The meaningless conversations you and I have every day with our friends and family. That is another thing missing from movies back then, humanity! On top of the risky, futile dialogue driven scenes, Tarantino mixed up the chronological order of the picture. And on the cherry on top of Tarantino's sundae is the misfit, creepy characters he asks us to identify with. Yet, through all of that the movie manages to soar and define itself as reputable piece of art. And that's the simplest and best way to sum up Pulp Fiction is art. Not only through Tarantino's inventive screenplay, but through his delicately placed direction. Each shot is filled with something unique that'd driven by the motivation of the characters or the overall arc of the story. It's a masterfully directed piece. The direction is even more artistic than the screenplay. With the screenplay, as much work as Tarantino put into penning the words, the actors are in control of the success of those words being told. In the direction, Tarantino is in control and he never relinquishes that control making the audience really feel plunged into the idiotic situations the characters end up in. There are moments where Tarantino injects huge laughs, chiseling thrills, and always retaining the humanity of the story. The three stories are all different, they are their own piece, that all work toward the same goal of each other, however each section has it's own tone and exclusive arc, they all end with the same two things: a saving of someone's life and a secret. I believe Tarantino intended for that to be a metaphor for a director/writer in their creative world making their movies. To be successful they have to work to save the industry they are releasing their films to and they have to keep their own voice to themselves and be unique, so no one else can steal their style. Beyond Tarantino's creative efforts much lies behind the walls of Pulp Fiction. Tarantino adds to the film's statement of Hollywood by finding a way to inject movie references of some of the highest regarded motion pictures, including The Godfather. The film editing bounces off the screen, staying true to the characters at hand and the film's plot in the moment. It's tight, brisk, and entertaining, while still saying something. With such a strong effort from its direction and screen writing aspects, it's clearly stated that it's not going to be an actors movie, though the four principle actors deliver some great work. The standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson, his best works lies with the final scene of the movie. It's a heated scene and Jackson only adds to the intensity. Bruce Willis highlights his career with his role, while John Travola and Uma Thurma deliver fine acting jobs and line deliveries as well.The definition of Pulp is written on the screen for us before we meet any of the characters at the start of the picture, defined as ""a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter"" and ""a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper."" That's exactly what this refreshing film is: messy, unorganized, and an unformed bulk of art. Rating: 10/10Grade: A+"
21 October 2000,Angeneer,0,2,10,As good as it gets,"It sounds cliche but I can't describe how much I love this movie. Whoever doesn't appreciate its cinematic excellence and utter coolness, must definitely see it again, very very carefully this time. Everything about Pulp Fiction has been said, so I'll use this space just to pay my respects to everyone involved."
20 December 2012,lagudafuad,0,2,8,Tarantino's best,"This Academy Award winning screenplay was done by Quentin Tarantino, the story is nonlinear and the screenplay is rich and the movie is full of stars. Tarantino's dream of making the movie look bigger than it actually is was achieved. Made with 8.5 million dollars, the movie looked like it was made with more. The story arc although it curves around 3 main and distinctive people and 3 main distinctive stories, it still has a way of reeling you in and keeping you attentive without losing you along the way.Meant to be a trilogy of three shorts, rather than a full length feature, it was first written by Roger Avary in the fall of 1990, while Tarantino worked on the script development 2 years after, the movie was then picked up for production by Columbia TriStar, who later dropped the movie because they felt the movie was too long, out of place and it was too low budgeted, before the producer Bender shipped it off to Miramax.The movie is depicted in a nonlinear tale also the narrative is presented out of sequence it is about three main characters. We have first a mob hit-man Vincent Vega (John Travolta) who was hired to kill Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Then we have a prizefighter Butch Coolidge, who double crossed a mobster by winning a bout that he took money for throwing. And the last main cast Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is Vincent's partner who felt he has heard a calling from God to leave the hit-man life, when he was shot and the shooter misses.Each story is interwoven and intersects at various parts; if well put together the movie makes one whole complete picture.Before this, John Travolta was losing his edge in his movies and Willis was finding it hard to make a good movie after many big budget flops, after this flick they both got their edge back. For Financing Miramax (the films distributors) totally financed the film, and paid all the main actors the same per week wage regardless of their status.The movie was a huge financial success making over 200 million from its 8.5 million production and it was a good introduction to Tarantino's film style of nonlinear story arc.Pulp fiction is a nice addition to movies on your shelf; it won an Academy Award and a BAFTA award for Best Original Screenplay for both Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. It also gave Samuel L. Jackson a BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor.www.lagsreviews.com"
17 April 2007,jts0405,0,3,10,Masterpiece from the Beginning,"When it first started out it had me locked in and ready to go. It seemed good from the first part when they were sitting in the café. From then I was grabbed in and couldn't help but not want to go on with it. It seems to me that this deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250. The place it is in is #5. Out of a total of the top 250 it made 5. That deserves credit, because filmmakers don't expect to write a movie that will make a top chart on a movie site. The actors made this movie. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and even the other side actors made this what it became. It shows a good line of America film making. It made a new genre it what movie genres are. It was sort of a drama, with a pinch of comedy and some action. That to me is a new type of genre in the eyes of making movies. I think that Tarantino really hit big when he made this movie, because now because of this one film that made big, his name will be up for grabs when a huge directing job comes up. For any that have not seen Pulp Fiction, it is an absolute must see. Rent it or buy it, anyway you should put this on a list of what to watch before you die. After it's done, you will know why."
31 January 2021,ondrejgurica,1,1,10,One the best movies of all time!,"Pulp Fiction is such a personal matter of my heart. Quentin Tarantino is without a doubt one of the most talented directors today, these films may be too harsh for some, full of violence, blood and brutality, but brilliant for others. I belong to the second group. It's one of the few movies that made a really strong impression on me and its news, I think they became popular and I use it every day. Above all, I must praise the acting performance of John Travolta, who is indelibly etched in my memory as Vincent Vega. I don't even have to comment on the soundtrack, one of the best I've heard. When I talk about Pulp Fiction, all I can think about is the superlative itself and so that it doesn't mean anything. it does not take that it has become a real CULT."
14 March 2007,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,0,2,10,a contemporary classic,"For a lot of film fanatics Quentin Tarantino's 1994 surprise hit ""Pulp Fiction"" is the modern-day equivalent of Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"", and therefore the prime example of a contemporary masterpiece. Whether or not this sort of praise is warranted, ""Pulp Fiction"" is still an all-around well-made film with pitch perfect casting, exceedingly memorable and quotable dialogue, and the sort of high quality film-making not generally seen in a director's second film.The film tells three interlocking tales that take place in the underbelly of Southern California's crime world. The stylistic choices and overall panache of the piece turn ordinarily life-low, repulsive characters into highly engaging pseudo-intellectuals with guns. The feat of making the ""bad guys"" sympathetic characters, worthy of undivided attention and intense interest, is one of many of the strengths of ""Pulp Fiction"".Beyond the obvious portrayals of unflinching darkly comedic violence and the rapid-fire stream of pop cultural and profanity-laced dialogue, there's an amazing depth to ""Pulp Fiction"" that was never quite duplicated in all of the films it has since influenced. ""Pulp Fiction"" remains a one of a kind wild ride for the senses and the intellect, and truly an important piece of cinema."
22 July 2016,bitte_k_i,1,2,8,Exciting film!,"Quentin Tarantino directed this film. This is American film and is about two gangsters. There are some stories in it and the axis of time is spread. I thought that, as the title says, each stories in it is silly and funny. But you must be attracted. Bible is quoted many times in this film. I think I could not understand it because I have never read bible. After watching this film, I want to read it. Reading bible may help me to know this film well. My favorite character is Jules. He is very interesting because he chants a part of bible before killing people. A worshipful gangster is very rare and inconsistent. He has a friend who is very common man and his way of thinking is almost normal. I do not understand why he is a gangster. I want to know the process of his being a gangster.After watching this film, you may feel complex because of each story cut into short piece and separated. But it does worth watching more than twice. In the second time, you certainly have a sight from other term."
14 June 2007,charchuk,0,2,9,A landmark film,"Could be the most profane film ever made, but the swearing never feels forced or unnatural - it just fits the distinctive dialogue. The stories told are nothing special or unique in and of themselves, but it's how they're told that makes this film so groundbreaking. Not only the mesmerizing, magnetic and often hilarious monologues, but the random chronological order in which they are presented. Just trying to figure out the order that everything occurs in is half the fun. And, though the main character is killed off in the film, he still survives at the end - how many movies can say that? Travolta is great in his comeback role, but Sam Jackson owns this film. One of the greatest performances of the '90s. As good as Landau was in Ed Wood, Jackson was even better. Definitely one of the closest Oscar races - for me, anyway - in recent memory. All around, just a visionary and landmark film."
12 April 2020,niconotnixon,2,5,5,I dont get it,This movie goes over my head. The violence is well done but not my taste and the way the story is told is cool but I just could not get into it. I know a lot of people love it so definitely give it a shot; but I am definitely missing something.

Don't watch it once, watch it over and over!"
28 October 2017,EthanBJones_03,0,2,10,Highly Recommended,"'PULP FICTION' - 1994Directed by Quentin Tarantino{Reservoir Dogs}Starring John Travolta{Carrie; Grease}, Samuel L Jackson{Jurassic Park; Jungle Feaver} and Bruce Willis{Die Hard; Hudson Hawk}Plot Overview: ​Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions. In this ultra-hip, multi-strand crime movie, their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) ; his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman) ; struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) ; master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer).I think that the best way for me to describe this movie is as follows: ""I don't know why that happened, but it did; and I like it"". Because that is pretty much my reaction to everything in this movie. From the chitchat to the dance scene: very little in this movie makes sense contextually to the plot but I really like it in that weird way. There is NO reason for half of what does happen to happen, but what does happen happens so what's the point in trying to complain?As far as my major praises go, it has to be to Quentin Tarantino. The man is a literal directing and stylistic God. His movies look so crisp and fantastic, and each of them have such a unique and interesting stylised look towards them. The way he frames shots is excellent; the editing is immaculate; the lighting is flawless: Tarantino movies are some of the most stylish movies that have ever been made, and are a huge factor in the reason why Pulp Fiction is such a great movie. Even though they are GREAT directors, Kubrick, Hichock, Spielberg, Scorcese, Fincher, Coppola, Welles - none of them could recreate the magic of Pulp Fiction, because Tarantino is the only man alive capable of doing so.Another major praise I can award the film is the sensational performances from all the cast. John Travolta is excellent as Vincent Vega and really shows that the man is capable of doing 'actual films' *cough* Battlefield Earth, yeah I know it came out after Pulp Fiction - be quiet *cough*. Accompanying Travolta is my personal favourite performance in this film: Samuel L Jackson as Jules. Holy Jesus was Jackson amazing in this movie. He sells every single scene he is in and was easily one of the best parts of this movie. The sheer raw emotion that he elicits at points makes me think that it wasn't acting; it was genuine frustration and anger. Also in this film is Uma Thurman{Dangerous Liaisons; Mad Dog and Glory}. Thurman was, surprise surprise, excellent in this movie. Despite not having a huge role, she sold every scene she was in and consistently gave me goosebumps in the simple way her and Travolta communicated. A man whom I did NOT know was in this movie was the great Bruce Willis. I knew that Travolta and Jackson and Thurman were all in this movie so I already knew they had some solid actors and a good cast. But then Willis showed up and I was blown away. We all know the man has impeccably action chops with the legendary film 'Die Hard', but up until now I hadn't really seen his dramatic capabilities. And let me tell you, he didn't disappoint. There are point in this movie were, similar to Jackson, I didn't actually believe that Willis was acting: merely existing. His performance was that authentic and realistic. A couple actors who had more minor roles but still did excellent jobs were Ving Rhames{The People under the stairs; Dave}, Harvey Keitel{Reservoir Dogs; Taxi Driver}, Tim Roth{Reservoir Dogs; Vincent and Theo} and Ammander Plummer{So I married an axe murdered; Joe Versus the Volcano}. Each of them definitely deserves praise for their performances.The story for this movie was amazing. The point of it still escapes me but I'm pretty sure that was apart of Tarantino's genius intentions. I love the fact that it doesn't give you all the answers and the FANTASTIC way the film is structured. Like seriously! I usually like non-linear storytelling but this takes the cake for some of the most interesting method of storytelling that I've seen. Of course, I won't spoil it. But rest assured that it is certainly rewarding to watch, granted that you're paying attention!A more minor praise that I can award this movie is the dialogue. It is SO good. Dialogue is usually one of Tarantino's strengths so I guess it's not a surprise but that doesn't detract from the sheer quality of it. Just something as simple as discussing cheeseburgers or asking about a watch are elevated to MEMORABLE scenes, purely based on Tarantino's phenomenal skill in writing.I do have one flaw with this movie, but it's not REALLY a flaw. I think that the second act can feel a little disjointed and not work that well when watching the film for the first time. Granted, it does make sense overall, but that doesn't change the fact that it feels VERY misplaced and out of context. The is doubly apparent when you consider its content differs COMPLETELY from Acts I & III. Again, this isn't a major complaint and I still love this movie, but it's something I think deserves a mention.Overall, I loved this movie. It's a modern day classic, and we have the cinematic genius Quentin Tarantino to thank for that. His style, his direction, his dialogue and his script are all PERFECT and are knitted together like a flawless quilt. It's remarkable how good the man is at what he does. I highly recommend this movie'. I'll rate 'Pulp Fiction' 10 'Royales With Cheese'!"

Hollywood's self obsession goes way over the top in this movie. If you think that American film is generally substandard, you really won't like this movie."

30 June 2019,Screen_O_Genic,0,2,8,A Cultie Done Good - Tarantino's Masterpiece,"A fun and sordid glimpse on the lives of gangsters, druggies and low life's with some cool tunes to punctuate them, ""Pulp Fiction"" is the bullet-riddled diner and tattered paperback of filmdom. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson lead the rabid pack as goons for hire who go through their share of thrills and mishaps in the City of Angels. The former is a bloated smoothie with bad hair; the other a religious zealot with an outdated afro. Together they argue, murder and laugh their way through gunshots, blood and assorted brain matter. The star-studded cast bring various interpretations to this tacky and tasty dish and they all shine. Some of the scenes are forever etched in film and the movie going public's memory - the dance scene at the diner, the S & M scene, and the bible quoting are among the most memorable in movie history. Being a Tarantino flick it's naturally light years from flawless: long, slow, wordy and what have you. After the flubs of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you'd figure Tarantino would finally get editing right or hire a damn editor but no matter. The best and most successful cult flick made, this is a ""Royale with cheese"" indeed."

                        ",C-U-L-T!!!!!!!,"What´s so special about ""Pulp Fiction""? There are dozens of ideas you´ve seen in other film before, the dialogues are trivial (about junk food, foot massages, serials on television...) and the plot is very confusing when you see this movie for the first time. The solution: ""Pulp Fiction"" is a penny dreadful on celluloid. Same as other cult movies like ""A clockwork orange"" or ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" you will get something, you´ve never seen before: a complete new style of film making! Tarantino´s masterpiece is full of strange types, striking conversations and scenes (especially Mia´s and Vincent´s dance, when Uma Thurman gets resuscitated...), a brilliant cast (John Travolta in the best role he ever played!), which would have been enough for five other films and a great soundtrack! At last it is also an homage about L.A., the city the director is living in. The whole story gets its thrill from the fact that the watcher has to combine all the different periods and places like a puzzle. A shame that ""Pulp Fiction"" only got two academy awards, because it has all ingredients a real cult movie has got to have: the film was copied for a hundred times, especially in the 90s, big guns became a status symbol of the modern cinema. Watch it 9 or 10 times and you will always find something new! Cult as cult can!!! My IMDb rating: a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
27 June 2006,theshadow908,0,3,10,Amazing film.,"Pulp Fiction tells many stories, but all of them involve the same characters. The movie takes place within a time span of three days and involves a cast of characters that is entirely criminal, including hit men, drug dealers, rapists, petty robbers, crime bosses, and a crooked boxer. This movie is very realistic, and features some of the best acting and direction I've ever seen.The entire concept of this film is awesome. Different stories involving crime are always intriguing, but especially when Quentin Tarantino does the directing. Quentin Tarantino both writes and directs this amazing movie, and it's his most perfect creation. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most talented writers out there. He has the ability to make dialogue as realistic as life. The characters discuss things such as coffee, hamburgers and foot messages. This may seem like too many conversations about nothing, but face it, it's how people really talk.The acting is absolutely awesome. This movie is so full of amazing actors, it was impossible for it to fail. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together. Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are as good as always too. Then there's the cameos such as Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken, and even they're great.Overall, this is an amazing film with absolutely no flaws. This is destined to become a timeless classic.10/10"
22 March 2007,aktowfik,1,3,10,Godfather of the 90's,"Perhaps I am the last one on planet Earth to see this film. I used to think that Tarantino is arrogant and over-rated, but after seeing this I regret all I said. This film is a masterpiece. Like Godfather, it's very rare to find a gangster movie script that puts all this concentration on characters and not the plot. The characters are alive.. full of controversies.. They r real life people. The girl who commits an armed robbery feels desire to pee.. The hit men talking about Hamburger on their way to the kill.. the finding that U have to wash a car with detergents after blowing the brains of a man... The hustle U cause for a drug dealer when trying to inject intra-cardiac adrenaline. This is charming. U don't give a damn about the plot.. Who cares ?... the dialog should be taught in film schools since U can't miss a single word .. They talk about milk shake and Ice cream, but U feel it's more interesting than talking about cocaine and dead gangsters. Everybody is superb.. U can never forget Thurman, Travolta or Jackson.. Even Tarantino's role is very amusing. This genre is a genuine mixture between film Noir and comedy.. I think I must see ""Kill Bill"" once more, for I didn't like it at first time."
13 December 2000,Rammstein-2,0,2,10,One of the best films ever made,"I remember when I first went to see this film. I had seen ""Reservoir Dogs"" fairly recently, and was expecting the same type of criminals, the same twisted but very funny dialogue and the same kind of realistic and disturbing violence. And boy, did I get it.It doesn't get much better than this. In it's genre (gangster-comedy-parody-action-whatever), it is the undisputed number one, its greatness not remotely threatened by anything. I can't even remotely discern what will top this.The characters are stunning, and the actors play them so well it was hard to imagine Travolta as anything else for a while (especially since he has yet to make a single decent film after this one). The cast list is impressive, and it is great to see Tarantino crediting their fantastic acting skills by giving each and every one a pivotal role in the plot (Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and so on). The dialogue is the best I have ever heard. The funny, weird and obtuse topics of discussion are handled with excellent care, making what seems like a really dumb discussion very realistic. Not to mention hilarious. Quotes from this film still haunts every day of my life. I have a friend who can't stop saying ""I'm ON the mother*****r"" whenever he's set to do something. ""Hezekiel 25:17"" is forever burned into my memory. The music is excellent. Tarantino continues to give the music a prominent role by using radios, stereos and the famous dance sequence - the music is constantly on somewhere in the background, in the story, in the plot.As far as the story goes, it couldn't be much better. It's fairly simple, but the timeline is sewn together in a very special and extravagant way (one that made my father totally hate this film), giving the viewer something to think about until the question is resolved. Excellent and, I imagine, something difficult to pull off so well. The sad part is that I don't think Tarantino will ever top this himself. I know it's a bad thing to say and think, but I just can't imagine anything in this genre that will come close to puzzling a story, a dialogue and characters together like this film does. Reaches a honorable number 5 on my cross-genre scale of the best movies ever made."
26 December 2005,tastyhotdogs,0,2,8,Landmark movie,"This is the first movie my friend Gary ever took me to see that left me feeling violated afterwards. In this case though, I knew I'd just seen something unbelievable.The movie has several stories going on that eventually inter-lap. The stories are told out of order, so it takes a fair while to work out what's going on, and only at the end can you properly piece it all together.Here are some of the great things about the movie: Revitalised John Travolta's career. He put in a top effort.Samuel L Jackson's best ever role. He was funny, scary, cool.Christopher Walken's cameo. Outstanding. Should have got nominated for an Oscar.Excellent supporting efforts by Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Quentin Tarantino.The lowlights were: - The movie got nominated for ""Best Movie"", but lost to ""Forrest Gump"", which has to be the biggest injustice ever. Wasn't Forrest Gump just a movie about a guy they digitally inserted into famous historical moments? - Felt the drug use basically glorified drugs, which was a bad move - The ""Gimp"" scenes. Not really necessary. Off-camera alluding to would have done just fine.But it's a funny, excellently written, well shot, brilliant movie"

                        ",The Best,"I personally don't think any single movie should be called ""The Best"". There are ""The Bests"", including movies like ""The Godfather"", ""American Beauty"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", but I've always thought that there was no ""Best"" movie.Then I saw ""Pulp Fiction""...and if I had to name any movie as ""The Best"", this would definitely be it.The plot has three different stories, intersecting and coming apart.  The first and main stories has hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) recovering a case for their boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and a subplot about Vince taking Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for some fun.  The second story has prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) being pursued by Marsellus for refusing to throw a fight - the two fall into some disturbing chaos.  The last and smallest plot is about two petty crooks (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob the diner that they're having breakfast in.I haven't mentioned this yet, but the film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  After this and ""Reservoir Dogs"" I think it's safe to say that he's one of the greatest writers of our time.  His lines manage to be cool but don't get too artificial like David Mamet's or slogan-like like William Goldman's (who are both still great).  His stories are the most creative of creative writing, his lines are awesome, his characters brilliant.And brilliant they are.  My personal favorite character is Jackson's cool, foul mouthed, Bible quoting hit man who has a religious experience after surviving what seems to be a now-way-out gunfight.  Jackson's performance is spot on, perfect, nothing beats this kind of acting.My second favorite is Butch.  Bruce Willis isn't a good actor - most of the time.  Thank God for movies like this, ""Die Hard"" and ""12 Monkeys"" for the guy to show his abilities.  His performance is perfect, Oscar worthy all the way.Speaking of the Oscars, it's a pity this didn't dominate.  If I had it my way it would've picked up Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman) and Best Editing, instead of Tarantino just getting one for the screenplay.  Oh, and Bruce Willis would get a nom for himself.The Best of The Best, 10/10."
29 July 2019,Movie_BUFF007,2,5,6,A review from a common honest man,"All the psuedu intellectuals will praise it. I'm a common man and I tell it like it is. This movie had not real plot or direction. I was not rooting for any of the characters. Dialogues were the only part that kept me hooked but I will be honest just because it was clever doesn't necessarily mean it had the greatest dialogues ever. Talking about direction, screenplay and cinematography. I found some things to be really unique. The way some things were done or shown. The acting was also great. And that's about it. The second half of the movie got a little tedious and I fell asleep. What I'm trying to say is it's a little too long which I think was unnecessary. My verdict - Dialogues 7/10, Acting 7/10 Camera work and direction - 6/10, Story - 3/10. Overall - 5.75/10 rounding it up to 6/10."

16 January 2007,OttoVonB,0,2,9,Great Expectations,"Three worlds collide. Vincent (Travolta) is an assassin for criminal king Marcelus Wallace (Rhames), whose wife Mia (Thurman) he is dangerously flirting with, against better advice from partner Jules (Jackson). Pumpkin (Roth) and Hunnie Bunnie (Plummer) are two psycho lovers, not far removed from Tarantino's creations in True Romance. Butch (Willis) is a washed-up boxer, indebted to Wallace after he refuses to fake defeat.There is one fundamental element that either makes Tarantino excellent or irritating, depending on the film: his almost nerdy knowledge of film lore. Starting off as a geeky video store clerk, Tarantino became a noted screenwriter (recicling many a conversation from his video store days in his film dialogue: culture debates, comic/film references etc.), then director (this time referencing films, mostly the French New Wave, US blacksploitation, Chinese/Hong Kong Kung Fu and Japanese samurai pics). More often than not, he injects a global coherence that is unique, which, coupled with a deft hand at directing actors, makes for awesome cinema. other times, the result is simply embarrassing.""Pulp Fiction"" plays audaciously with its narrative structure, has some magnificently slick photography - though heavily inspired by the New wave - and manages the beguiling feat of uniting such a mouth-watering cast on top form. It made Samuel L. Jackson a household name and gave Travolta a chance at rebirth (before he sabotaged himself again with Battlefield Earth), and yet...For all the fine moments, Pulp Fiction is undone by its nature: it s pulp. The editing dazzles, but the story goes nowhere. Some dialogue sizzles but the overall cohesion is quite uneven. This makes Pulp Fiction a hard film to enjoy when not stoned: it is a succession of great moments that have nothing to do together, like a best-of show-reel of a TV series, so that when you try to take your distance to evaluate it as a whole, it proves dangerously wanting - and, at 160 minutes, dangerously long for its contents. The daring auteur of the brilliant ""Reservoir Dogs"" has overreached himself.Perhaps Tarantino himself realized this excess: he went on to make the more controlled and muted Jackie Brown, before exploding again, this time in the action department, with Kill Bill (an amusing but suspiciously unoriginal revenge epic that rips off every established kung fu classic out there). However, he did devote time to promote Asian underdogs in the US, and help cookie mavericks make it in the US.Back to Pulp Fiction. See it at least once for its good moments. At least part of the hype is true..."
8 May 2022,jamesnew-96383,2,3,10,Still the best of Quentin Tarantino,"Pulp Fiction embodies everything that Tarantino does right, this witty, shocking, and entertaining film combines all his traits into one great film.All his trademarks are here: the unknown music that becomes instantly iconic, the gory action, the payoff, and the stream of entertaining characters.Extreme bias, but I cannot think of any issues with this well crafted gift of a film.A solid 10/10 from me."

The movie sets place in a underworld filled with hit men, drug dealers, a cocaine sniffer, robbers, and a down on his luck boxer. The film had a really great tone to the film and was brilliantly written and directed by the talented Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker that takes his films and mixes up the script, characters, and all the class given to the film. The movie had a brilliant cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis. They all made their performances challengingly brilliant, and the story gets mixed into strange actions, endless conversations, and amazing dialogue. This movie is the ""grand-daddy"" of motion pictures. Watch this and you won't be disappointed. I thought the film was an interesting piece of work that will lead Tarantino's career to the next level, and it's one of the best movies that the 90s has ever seen. This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it's always entertaining to watch over and over again. ""Pulp Fiction"", in my review, ""a well- written piece of Tarantino commentary."""
17 June 2014,adam-30-935925,4,6,10,Pure genius!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincent's recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that it's the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the ""gold watch"" speech to Harvey Keitel's dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy."
8 December 2004,dc_follies,1,2,7,Half of the movie is great,"Pulp Fiction is definitely a movie that can be watched over and over so that you can pick up more of the giant metaphor that Tarrantino puts on the screen. I can't give this a perfect score, however, because the more I watch this movie, the longer and longer the Thurman-Travolta story seems to take. The portions of the movie with Samuel L., John Travolta and Bruce Willis are by far the most interesting portions of the story - there is better dialogue and what lies behind the curtain is more substantial. The hour or so with Uma Thurman is simply not very interesting. It bogs the story down, bringing the movie almost to a halt. I like the way Tarrantino directs the film and the screen play is excellent, though there is so much swearing that it is almost difficult to overcome. I don't know anyone that swears nearly as much as these characters do (typical of anything QT has written) - newsflash Quentin, outswearing a Marine doesn't add to a story.Much better than average, but not exceptional. *** of ****"

Had this screenplay been submitted to a screenwriting teacher, it would of gotten a D-.  It destroys all conventional writing rules.  Within twenty minutes of the film, we have been introduced to at least five barely linking major characters.  It's heavy on talk (But what talk!)  By the time the supposed lead (John Travolta as a cool moving hit-man/drug abuser) and his ""date"" (Uma Thurman as a gangster's wife) win the dance contest, you are saying ""I am forty-five minutes into this film.

29 October 2020,sherylchilders82,1,5,4,I never liked it,"While I admit I haven't seen this in many years, it was extremely popular when I was a teenager, so I saw it in my most formidable years. I'm generally not a Tarantino film fan, but I don't hate them either. People say he's a film genius, but he's really just a pop icon. His work is very narrow to Hollywood views and doesn't have any larger meaning. You can tell this is true because none of the ubiquitous 10 star reviews are more than a paragraph and all say about the same thing. They say this is the greatest film of all time but none really say why in any great detail. And that's because, while unique and visually appealing, this film speaks to a specific aspect of culture, and that's all.In particular, it speaks to a more primitive and cruel part of humanity that wants a green light to be callous and cruel, and to not feel bad about it. His main characters are always overly masculine types that don't have any moral qualms with violence as a solution to problems. Like other reviewers, I've always found it troubling how most people do not notice the undertones of meanings slipped into his films that are deeply misogynistic. They largely appeal to a younger and male audience that is culturally programmed to place visual hedonism over philosophical and intellectual meaning. Overall, I find it to be ""pretty"" in a morbid way but superficial. My biggest complaint is that the women in his films are always black and white, while the men (especially main characters) have complicated motivations.."

There is no resolve either good or bad at the end of the film. It is empty, sick, and disgusting. There is no theme. The dialogue is made for skin-heads as Bruce Willis' hair style in the film confirms. And Uma Thurman's famous head-shaking scene is ultra silly."
12 July 2013,jcbutthead86,0,2,10,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Unforgettable Masterpiece Of Cinema From Quentin Tarantino.","Puip Fiction is easily one of the greatest films ever made and a flawless unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and filmmaking. Filled with excellent direction,great performances from the cast,a perfect well-written screenplay and an amazing soundtrack,Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films and is Quentin Tarantino's greatest film and a masterpiece.Set in Los Angeles,California,Pulp Fiction tells three interconnected tales set in the crime world that involve two Hit-men Vincent Vega(John Travolta)and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L. Jackson),Mia Wallace,(Uma Thurman),a Gangster's wife and aging boxer Butch Coolidge(Bruce Willis)and all four have to deal with violence,death and redemption.Pulp Fiction is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made a flawless and unforgettable film that is an instant masterpiece and classic from the very moment that you watch. Pulp Fiction is great film because while the film is in the genre of Crime Drama,it's a little more than that because it's a film that mixes categories. It's an epic and violent Crime Drama,a stylized Gangster Film,a Film-Noir,a surreal Black Comedy,a tale of revenge,redemption and fate,an homage and tribute to movies that came before it. Quentin Tarantino takes elements of those genre that I mentioned above and turns them on their heads giving viewers a film that is original,imaginative and unconventional and doesn't play by the rules and that is one of the things I love about the film. Pulp Fiction changed the way I looked at films because before I saw PF movies had plots and stories that moved from A to B but PF was the first film I saw that was told in a unconventional structure that tells the story in a back and forth fashion like chapters in book or a novel. What I love about each of the three stories(Vincent Vega And Marcellus Wallace's Wife,The Gold Watch and The Bonnie Situation)in the film is how wild and unpredictable they all are and how in some ways oddly enough each story is a morality tale with a dark and funny twist. Each story has a wild spin on violence,drugs and sex and the things that happen in all of the stories will disturb but at the same time you are riveted and glued to the screen. The four main characters in the movie Pulp Fiction,Vincent,Jules,Mia and Butch are among the best characters Tarantino has ever conceived because each character is cool and with brilliance. Vincent and Jules are classic characters because despite being hit men are stylish characters with unique personalities who have hilarious conversations about Fast Food Joints,Hamburgers,foot massages and TV pilots and the dialog between the two is funny and memorable. Mia Wallace is one of the few female characters in the film but when she's on screen you never forget her because she is beautiful and charming and when watch Mia and her date with Vincent you can tell that she is flirting with Vincent and playing mind games because we don't know if Mia likes Vincent or if Vincent likes Mia and that's one of the mysteries of the film. Butch Coolidge is a great character because he's an antihero that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir as a character who is caught in big circumstances that are beyond his control and he has to do what he has to do to survive and fight back. All four characters are amazing,powerful and iconic and help define the movie and after you see Pulp Fiction you will never forget any of them as long as you live. The screenplay by Tarantino(which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay)is brilliant and perfect with Tarantino each of the main characters great dialog that is fresh and original with a lot of funny black humor that is smart and creative. The violence in the film is brutal and shocking but at the same time funny and morbid and matches surreal over the top tone of the film. The ending of the film is powerful and captivating because while it is intense it's also calm and collective and makes you think. A wonderful ending.The whole cast is perfect. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent and brilliant as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield,two cool hit-men. Tavolta and Jackson are great together. Uma Thurman is wonderful as Mia Wallace,Marcellus' wife and has great chemistry with Travolta. Bruce Willis is fantastic as Butch,a tough boxer with an honor code and moral ambiguity. Harvey Keitel is great and cool as Winston Wolf,a man who solves problems. Ving Rhames is great and intimidating as Marcellus Wallace,a local crime boss. Tim Roth(Pumpkin)and Amanda Plummer(Honey Bunny)are wonderful and funny as boyfriend/girlfriend robbers. Eric Stolz and Rosanna Arquette are fabulous as Lance,Vincent's friend and drug dealer and Jody,Lance's wife. Christopher Walken is great in his small role as Captain Koons,a soldier that visits Butch. Maria De Medeiros does a fine job as Fabianne,Butch's girlfriend.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent and wonderful with Tarantino always moving the camera with long tracking shots either straight forward or with hand held photography and using close ups and slow camera movements giving the film a great style. Amazing direction by Tarantino.The soundtrack is masterful and one of the best soundtracks in film history with songs by Dick Dale And The Del Tones(Misirlou),Kool & The Gang(Jungle Boogie),Al Green(Let's Stay Together),Chuck Berry(You Never Can Tell),Dusty Springfield(Son Of A Preacher Man),Neil Diamond,(Girl,You'll Be A Woman Soon),The Centurians(Bullwinkle Part II),Link Wray(Ace Of Spades,Rumble),The Lively Ones(Surf Rider),The Slater Brothers(Flowers On The Well),The Revels(Comanche)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Pulp Fiction,an excellent and brilliant unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

                        ","Most overpraised movie of the last 100,000 years","Gen-x audiences, overstuffed by the yupped-out aesthetic of the Spielberg/John Hughes eighties, were dying for a soupcon of seventies grunge--something urban and gritty, but ironic and retro, to fit the cynical, beat-out, slackitudinous mood of the late George Bush era. That's how Quentin Tarantino served his wake-up call to the world with RESERVOIR DOGS in 1991, the alarm clock that jolted American cinema's eyes open after the long coma between BLUE VELVET and it. And PULP FICTION was the one that knocked the ball out of the park--commercially speaking. To find a cultural nerve-pinching phenomenon of similar force, you'd have to go back to BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER. But even they didn't have the seismic, global force of this movie: it may be hard to remember a few years later, but this picture, and its author, were burned onto the public consciousness and referenced 24/7 for long, long after its release.Seen in retrospect, it's clear what put the movie over--it's like a smooth, upscale theme store stocked with gen-x fetish items (heroin! faded seventies icon! jherri curls! tongue-in-cheek machismo! Kool and the Gang! Fruit Brute!) that could make the most out-of-it yahoo feel like a hipster.What's also clear is that it's a logy, stilted, stagebound piece of work that doesn't seem to take place in any lifelike universe, even a stylized one. The only rhythm the movie can claim is that of a writer impressed with his ability to make coiled, jivy dialogue. Scenes drag on and on as Tarantino keeps on stylin'. The center section of the movie--a boxer's romance with a French honeypie and his escape from a gangster he's double-crossed--is so thoroughly leaden and spontaneity-deprived you'd think it would've been enough to sink the movie alone. But somehow the combination of the star-studded cast and the ""inside""-y, you-can-be-hip feel of the picture made it a blockbuster of the calibre usually reserved for movies about skyscrapers or planets exploding.Sadly, Tarantino, after a long, nail-biting hiatus, made his first genuinely great movie, JACKIE BROWN, which highlights all his strengths and eschews each of his flaws. All the fans who obsessed over the smallest minutiae of PULP greeted this impressive, grown-up work with a shrug and a quick retreat."
14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,0,2,9,By a cinephile for cinephiles,"Why does everyone like ""Pulp Fiction"" so much? I've been watching this film at least a dozen times, but brilliant screenplay aside, I couldn't come up with concrete answers. After all, there does not seem to be any kind of message, the characters are mere caricatures, and the plot is so marginal that the film keeps going for one more hour after, everything is completely resolved. Still, there seems to be something so fascinating that keeps the viewer hooked to the screen every time.The film could be described as an anthology of anecdotes and episodes from the L. A. underworld. Tarantino introduces a dozen iconic antiheroes whose paths keep crossing, sometimes in the most surprising ways, with no plotline being particularly prominent. Most of them seem nothing like cartoonish caricatures, but we gradually get attached to them as we learn a lot of both realistic and unusual facets of their personalities through the casual dialogues. Some of them get killed off in the stupidest ways ever seen on screen, but still leave an indelible mark. There is this sensation that anything could happen, as every time things seem to get predictable enough, the story takes unexpected turns.The narration is mostly linear; there are some leaps back and forward in time that supposedly disoriented the viewers in 1994, but we are always given clear cues so that it is impossible to get lost. The camera also bothers to show us apparently insignificant dialogues and details only to get them explained later, mostly to trigger new situations or connect different plotlines. While the photography and art direction are not as mature as Tarantino's later works, the eccentric editing choices and the spot-on use of music manage to make the difference here. Combine this with the crisp writing and screenplay full of memorable lines, and you get one of the best post-modern black comedies of the last century. It's also interesting how a film that is essentially an incoherent collage of references and situations borrowed straight from other movies can at the same time be so quotable. Sometimes it feels like ""Pulp Fiction"" is getting a bit too much credit for the wrong reasons, but it's undeniably one of the most memorable films of the '90s and a game-changer for mainstream filmmaking."
17 December 2019,saramatrazzo,1,2,7,Do the Twist,"Something so hilariously wholesome about the dialogue in this film. Talk about travel, food, the offensiveness of a foot rub... but also full of violence, drugs, and some blood. Super realistic shots of Uma ODing stuck with me. This was an enjoyable film with a pretty plain and raw film style. Lots of long shots to witness the chemistry between characters. Cool soundtrack too."
7 July 2014,dickdickenson0,18,41,1,Random scenes,The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevsky's movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevsky's movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad.
9 September 2012,raptile5,6,14,5,Just overrated...,"I just made an account when I saw this movie, and in my opinion it is the most overrated movie ever. 70% of the movie is boring, the other 30% are solid, but not great. I really don't understand how this movie is rated so well on IMDb (8.9)I am a Tarantino fan, so I am really wondered about the outcome of this. This movie isn't even near as good as Shawshak Redemption or The Godfather, and I will go so far to say that this movie is one of the worst I saw lately. Anyways, that's just my opinion, and maybe this movie blow you'r mind, but it didn't blew mine.I want my 2h and 34 minutes back..."
11 November 2013,ryanflynn,6,10,10,"Coming of age film. No, seriously.","I am not much for writing reviews, so this will be brief, as well as the polar opposite of profound. I saw this movie when I was 17 and it changed my life. Up to that point, movies I watched were one dimensional action flicks with cliché characters and predictable plots. Pulp Fiction made me laugh, cringe, yell out loud, cover my eyes and get nauseated. It was the first movie that I saw that I couldn't stop thinking about for days after. I watched it again and again, picking up new details, and connecting the dots. This film opened my eyes up to a whole different genre of movies and a whole new appreciation for storytelling. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and in some ways, still is. It is full of memorable characters, scenes and quotes. Simply awesome."

                        ",Top o' the list,"I can't believe people told me this was a horrible movie. I spent quite some time avoiding it because of the negative feedback. Now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW! This was a truly great movie. Great acting, great dialogue, and it is not as violent as some people make it out to be. Definitely a must see."
11 February 2002,bix171,0,2,10,Tarentino's Shot,"Quentin Tarentino's encyclopedic passion for noir films as well as seventies' television action shows is so powerful that you get giddy watching it and you have the sense that if no real ground is being broken, then at least `Pulp Fiction' is a culmination of a host of ideas. Linking together three stories (created by Tarentino and Roger Avery but with Tarentino getting the screenwriting credit) in a structure that can only be considered arcane for a film, he pulls out all the stops, cramming in as many references as he can to the pop culture that fascinates and repulses him. And working with his cinematographer, Andrzej Sekula, he creates an ugly, dirty Los Angeles underworld, the color baked out of it by a hot oppressive sun, in which his sordid characters (portrayed, among others, by John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, each unforgettable) attempt to find value in their lives while wading through all the random violence and mistrust their world offers. If there are excesses--and there are, plenty of them--Tarentino can be forgiven them this time because you get the feeling that this is his best shot and he has to make the most of it. He succeeds brilliantly."
6 August 2001,Dockelektro,0,2,10,The Dawn...,"... of a new wave in movies, of the ""slacker-with-a-gun-low-budget-oldies-ridden-soundtrack"" genre, of a concept of independent cinema and of the perception of the new values and their importance to today's movies. This one started everything from point zero, shuffled it again, left everyone baffled with the genius that can be extracted of what can be a banal setting and banal characters at first sight. This movie also shows how a completely new type of script can be born and how it can be more than half of a movie's success (just check out the quotes section). And it is also an example of how much you can play and establish a cult around a single, two-and-a-half-hour-long set of frames (and check the trivia section, perhaps the longest in the entire IMDb). A complete set of influences started here, and therefore its many ground-breaks were mirrored and copied countless times, like rescuing decaying actors and trying to use smart lines to make up for plot holes. And its position in the all-time-best list of IMDb, its collection of awards, its new face and freshness all make a great movie, which benefits from the marriage of clever directing, great script, striking editing and incredible actors rescued from the limbo (John Travolta's evolution emerges as the biggest standout, but his performance is easily overtaken by Samuel L. Jackson's religious killer Julius or Uma Thurman's fantastic stylish drug-addict Mia Wallace). A winner on all aspects, this movie is, no doubt one of the best of all time, and deserves its place in the podium. From this movie on, anything was not the same."

                        ",Rubik Puzzle cinema,"I finally watched Pulp fiction! Somehow I thought it would not be a movie for me, and I was right. It did two things for me. It explained why I should not come here and put a comment although it also entertained me thoroughly. This could be conflicting statements but it just what happened. Yes I watched and understood very little but seeing those dead pan actors I enjoyed often in many of their movies was really a rewarding experience, yet it certainly did not enhance my self-esteem! For more understanding I read, here, Kilopod's review, the first fairly comprehensive review I scrawled to and found it very enlightening but it also may have led me to a sad conclusion about myself. I don't know if it is my hearing defect or my thinking defect that left me in the ""noir with that ""comedie noir"". There was a suggestion that one should see this work several times to fully appreciate it. Perhaps I'll need to hire a version with subtitle for my next viewing as dialogues in it are said to be ""the icing on the cake""... And perhaps for this particular movie ""spoiler""warning should be lifted or recommended as the more you know about the story possibly the more you will enjoy it."

1 November 2021,ahmxii,0,1,10,Masterpiece..!,"Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms.This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10."

20 March 2020,ssssgelojun,0,1,9,pulp fiction,"There are drug dealers, killers, mob bosses, women obsessed with sex, murderers, violent boxers, homosexuals, black-dealing cops, all of whom are featured in pulp novels full of violence, and politically incorrect content, many of the scenes are scenes from other literature and movies. The structure of the film is like shuffling an unopened deck of playing cards before us, but it doesn't look at all out of place."
29 July 2015,michaelradny,0,2,10,Not Just A Good Soundtrack,"This is entertainment at its peak. With an A-Grade cast comes an A-Grade film. Quentin Tarrntino puts up a superb film with this crime drama giving the audience a non-linear timeline to follow along with his mark of blood, swearing and insane drug use. Pulp Fiction proves to be one of the best films ever made and never denies the audience of good fun, fast paced, action packed entertainment. If only more films outside this terrific director would strive to be as risky and pull it off. A must see for everyone. Even the youngsters will find something to love about this hardcore film. It's not too bad in terms of obscenities and I think that just adds more to the hectic world that has been created. 100% enjoyed this from start to finish."
27 July 2009,aldinchova,1,2,10,Masterpiece with non-linear intelligent story,"This artistic masterpiece does not have a linear story like in most of the movies.When Tarantino made this movie,he wanted you not just to enjoy the plot,but also to use your mind and construct the story from beginning to the end. He wanted you to think,not to be passive viewers. Scene in the end of movie with Vega (Travolta),Jules (Jackson)and burglars in restaurant is not the end of the story. The end of the story is scene when Butch (Bruce Villis)and his girlfriend leave Los Angeles on a motorcycle. This scene is put almost in the middle of the film. If you are not careful this film can easily delude you. There is a scene when Butch comes to his house to pick up something important to him and finds Vega in his home.He kills Vega,but we see Vega alive and with Jules in last part of movie. How? Because that scene in restaurant happened before scene when Butch comes to his house and finds Vega. Scenes when Vega and Jules come to Marsellus,their boss and Jules says that he is going to quit his job because of all that happened and Butch is seating and talking with Marsellus and scene when Marsellus is chasing Butch on the street and they are shooting at each other,that also happened after scene with robbery in restaurant. Simply,there is no linear story.You have to construct the story from beginning to the end in your head.This is one of many things that make this movie so intelligent and probably the best movie of 1990s,also one of the best films ever made (you can put it on list of 100 best films of all times).Acting and conversations in this film are almost perfect. Every character Vega (Travolta),Jules (Jackson),Marsellus (Wing Rhames), Butch (Villis),Mia (Thurman),Mr.Wolfe (Harvey Keitel),Pumpkin-Ringo (Tim Roth),Captain Koons (Chrisopher Walken),Honey Bunny-Yolanda (Amanda Plummer),Zed (Peter Green) and many others contribute to excellence of all stories in movie. Stories seem to be separated but they are all connected in some way as we see during a film. Soundtrack is furious.Especially opening melody of the movie.Iconic. Also melody in the end is excellent (Surf Rider). Or scene when Vega and Mia dance.Unforgettable.Or scene when Vega comes to Mia in her house and song ""Son of a preacher man"" is played. But all of that would mean nothing without enormous creativity and imagination that was used for this film when it was made. This movie is not just an artistic masterpiece, it has a point and message about unbearable lightness of existence. About how cost of negligence could be too high,and why life is something most precious that we have. It also have a dose of black humor and irony of life and death. Almost every scene is put where it belongs,and every conversation has some point.Story about human ego and presumption,about how life can be beautiful and terrible at the same time.And above all of that this film is i repeat my self masterpiece of creativity and imagination. For the end there is one scene when Butch returns to his girlfriend and she asks him where is her car. He answers that he crushed a car but he took a motorcycle.She asks whose motorcycle is that,and he answers that it belongs to Zed. She asks-""Who is Zed?"" He answers-""Zed is dead"". What a black humor funny rhyme."
21 May 2020,chubarova,0,1,10,Genius film.,"This film can be named one of the best film of 20th century. Firstly, the plot is very interesting, it tells number of different stories that connect with each other. These are small stories, but following it is very catching. And each story has twisted moments that can surprise viewers. Of course, it has a lot of blood, murders and drugs. Secondly, the cast is wondrous, duet of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta is ine of the best in the cinema. The dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta is the iconic one. Also, this film created a lot of iconic moments that are known by everyone.
So, it's one of the best film ever by genius Tarantino."

                        ",it still seems far-fetched,"All right most people writes eulogies on that movie. I can see that many people praise its ""its fragmented storyline, eclectic dialog, irony and camp influences, unorthodox camera-work, and numerous pop culture references"". Before calling it one of the best pieces of moving pics we gotta keep a few things in our mind.We gotta roll then over in our heads. ***One would wonder why a professional such as Vincent would not keep his gun on him: the answer may be that it was Marsellus' gun. And yet another clue may be that Vince does nothing when the door to Butch's apartment opens: he thinks he knows who it is. But can anyone give an exact answer? It may be just a coincidence right? ***The rapists take Marsellus into the back room and rape him; Butch escapes his bonds and in a disturbing, comic, and somewhat surreal scene. Does anyone think this was a unrealistic scene? He could untie those sturdy robes just because he is a boxer?(He is definitely not a palooka as he is called by Vincent but it still seems far-fetched?) ***While driving back to the motel from the apartment complex, Butch accidentally (and literally) runs into Marsellus himself.Another divine intervention right? ***Jules himself, after he and Vincent are shot at repeatedly from point-blank range yet survive?? I understand that redemption and divine intervention are two themes that drive us to think but the way I think is that these are not just like that. They sound more like like a coincidence.That's why I don't see this movie as a piece of perfection!One should think before giving it a top-ten vote!"
5 January 2006,Pookyiscute,0,2,10,Best Tarantino film you'll ever see...,"I know there are some of you out there, who really enjoyed, 'Jackie Brown', but for those like me, who found it dull and untentertaining as hell...then, you might like this much more. 'Fiction' is one of the most clever, well-written and well-casted films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.It's writing is so intuitive, and yet basic at the same time, that it's hard not to enjoy this film.Murder, guns, boxing ""dives"", sex, drugs, and of course intense action, have you rustling for the remote to turn the volume up, so as not to miss a single syllable spoken by any of the characters. The editing and placement and timing of the scenes, is perfect and well-designed. John Travolta, although not as heart-throb-ish, as in 'Saturday Night Fever', was the only person who could have played this character. OK...maybe that's not true. I can think of several who would have been just as good, but he still has made this one of his many signature roles. His hair (which is the most unflattering you will ever see on him) and lethargic demeanor, and attitude give him the quality of performance that you will leave the film with a pleasant and humorous perspective. But, this is not only because of Travolta's work. There are many others in the film who give you the comic relief, including; Samuael L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Harvey Keitel. However, the dramatic and less jovial performance in the film, is that of Bruce Willis' character - who was my favorite in the film, as a matter of fact - in which he plays a boxer, payed to take a dive, but collects on the money before going down in the fifth round, and then, actually, killing the other player. Leaving the 'rough force' to follow after him, as he tries to make his escape. Tarantino, is not only an excellent writer (this film aside from all others he's ever done), and even more so an excellent director. I have so many favorite scenes and clips from the movie that are so good, but it would take to long to parlet, on just which ones are. I definitely do not recommend this film to anyone under eighteen, and remember that this is NOT a family film. If you want to watch this, make sure you do it WITHOUT the kids. However, it is a commendable film, and I think just about anyone who enjoys well-written comedy and stories, with an actual plot and point, will enjoy this piece."

10 January 2015,williampsamuel,0,4,10,"Bizarre, Blood Drenched, Near Undescribable and Truly Incredible, Pulp Fiction is a Must See","In a previous review, I wrote that Terantino's Reservoir Dogs was ""one of the most blood soaked, shockingly violent, and wildly entertaining movies I've ever seen"", that ""it makes you want to laugh, then leaves you wondering if you're all there"" and that ""Terantino must be nuts to come up with material this demented."" All this is even truer of Pulp Fiction. This movie is violent, completely off the wall, often downright bizarre, and one of the best films I have ever watched. It contains some of the deepest, funniest, and most realistic dialog put on film, features a highly talented ensemble cast, and manages to be totally original while at the same time paying homage to the best (or at least hippest) pieces of twentieth century pop culture.I won't get into the standard plot summary because there is no way to summarize it. In fact, you could say there is no one plot, but rather several parallel ones that briefly intersect. And none of this is in any particular order. You really don't have any idea what this movie is about until it's over, and even then you wouldn't be able to explain it to someone else. Suffice it to that Pulp fiction revolves around the interactions of one of LA's top gangsters (Ving Rhames), his girlfriend (Uma Thurman), his two best hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson), their drug dealer (Eric Stoltz) a washed up boxer (Bruce Willis), a pair of small time thieves (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), and a briefcase of great value and unknown contents.In any case, the plot isn't what's important. It merely serves as a vehicle for blood drenched shootouts and fight scenes, dance offs, pop cultural asides, and fascinating conversations. The best known of these is of course the cheeseburger scene, in which Vince and Jules (Travolta and Jackson's characters) discuss the French terms for McDonald's items while driving through a run-down section of LA. On the face of it, their dialog may seem pointless, or lightweight, but that's exactly what's brilliant about it. From their conversation, you'd never guess that they're on their way to kill someone. They're just a couple of buds chatting it up. They could be going to dinner or a movie premier. But then they step out of the car, remove their guns from the trunk, and become all business. The sudden transition from cheeseburgers to contract killings is abrupt, completely unexpected, and absolutely brilliant.At other times, even in the wackiest settings, the dialog borders on the profound. Take for instance Jackson's Old Testament spiel before killing someone. Ezekiel 25:17 would surely be the most awesome verse in the Bible if it weren't cobbled together from three different verses. Or take Travolta and Thurman's conversation at Jackrabbit Slim's. They're sitting in a booth shaped like a Cadillac, being waited on by a Buddy Holly look alike, but they manage to achieve fairly deep insight into the awkwardness and discomfort we all feel when getting to know someone. To quote, ""Why do we feel it's necessary to talk about bull**** to be comfortable. But before we're given too much time to ponder such matters, the film makes another abrupt turn, giving us an overdose scene that is both shocking and hysterical. It's like a keystone cops routine with a woman's life in the balance, if you can imagine such a thing. This combination of the horrifying and the hilarious is of course one of the trademarks of Terantino's work. A similar dynamic is at work in the entire 'Bonnie Situation' section, in which Terantino makes an extended appearance and gets what might be the Pulp Fiction's best line. And don't even get me started on the 'Bring out the gimp' scene.Besides the graphic violence and the fair amount of sexual content, some of which is thankfully only implied, language is also a big part of the movie's shock value. The people in this movie use more profanity than a high school freshman trying too hard to establish street cred. I lost count of the F-bombs somewhere around 100, and I wasn't even at the halfway point. Yet not a single utterance ever seems unnecessary or added just to shock. Instead, we get the feeling that this is just how these people talk, and why wouldn't they, given their lines of work. And in many cases the screenplay uses profanity to great comic effect, as with the aforementioned Terantino delivered line, which derives its impact from a certain racial epitaph so charged that I dare not say it.Honestly, I'm not sure that anything I write can do justice to this movie. Few films have ever been as original, oddball, or memorable as Pulp Fiction. No other movie in the last twenty years has had the same impact on popular culture or spawned as many imitators. Pulp Fiction is to 70's exploitation films what Indiana Jones is to the pulp serials of the 30's and 40's. It will be likely be too much for many audiences, and for goodness sake keep it away from the kids, but for fans of any of the many genres this movie fits into it will come as a real treat."

I believe I see them all. So I went to see this when it came out because some Oz friends of mine highly recommended it. The film starts out well enough. (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's performances gave me high hopes). Needless to say from there there was long, long 160 minute spiral out of control. An all-star cast and a great soundtrack notwithstanding. I just didn't ""get it"" then...and frankly I still don't. I have enjoyed a few of Tarantino's other films, but this one was just vile. I can't recommend it, but I do believe in to each his/her own. Watch at your own risk."

                        ",THE BAD ASS MAMA JAMA BIG DADDY OF ALL MOVIES!,"Quentin Tarantino struck mega paydirt with this little diddy of a movie. And invented, or perhaps, re-invented a whole genre of film.  Tarantino is perhaps the most derivative filmmaker in history, but much like rap music, Tarantino has taken the art of ripping off other people's ideas and making them fresh and cool.The shoots out and wiseguys in black suits with skinny ties?  That's straight outta John Woo and Scorsese.  The pop culture references?  That's Godard.  The trippy way the film jumps back around in time?  Jim Jarmusch and Kurosawa did it first.  Despite all of this Tarantino has made a brilliant film.  You don't just see 'Pulp Fiction'.  You drink it, eat it, bleed it, breathe it, savour it, spit it out and ask for more.  You can dig that can'tcha?"
24 May 2006,Cedric_Catsuits,0,2,10,"Artistic, comic-book masterpiece","Amazingly there are people who don't seem to get this film. Of course it's violent, sick even. But it's funny as heck and the characters are as colourful and well-crafted as any from movie history. For God's sake, the title should tell you something about the intentions here - it's designed purely to entertain at a fairly base level. It succeeds - but it also excels in terms of innovation, writing, photography, directing, sound track and some of the best performances you will ever see. Those that protest probably do so because they fear it reflects a part of their own inner selves that they would rather ignore. There is good and evil in all humans, but those that deny their capacity for evilness are the most dangerous. Ignorance is not bliss.This movie won't make anyone violent - probably the opposite. It won't turn us all into perverse monsters. It should make us laugh at our own stupidity, and revel in out humanity. It should make us dance and sing. It is the ultimate in human entertainment and I warn you now - beware those that misunderstand or denounce this movie, for it is they that pose the greatest danger to our society."

7 October 2006,galileo3,0,4,10,"""Intoxicating. Tarantino's revolutionary picture is one of paramount influence. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made""","Pulp Fiction (1994) TOP 10 - 1990sTop 50 - All Time Pulp Fiction is an exuberantly joyous introduction of Quentin Tarantino into mainstream film-making. ""On the surface is a scruffy, violent and vulgar crime drama, but beneath it there all elements of comedy and just about everything else...""Directed in a highly stylised manner and incorporating three intertwining stories in non-chronological order, along with an outrageously good yet extremely irrelevant script, Pulp Fiction re-writes cinematic history, with its 'neo-noir' attitudes. Tarantino crafts a modern yet vintage cinematic masterwork that is as unorthodox as unorthodox can be. Here is a daring, young, new director not afraid to push cinematic boundaries, who creates a supremely influential picture that entertains, enthrals and leaves many in absolute awe. Pulp Fiction can be characterised as aimless: a group of lowlife, low key gangsters that talk about foot massages and alternative names of fast food burgers in other countries, while carry out dull yet bloody crime tasks. This film is the Macbeth of the modern fast food culture, an obscenely poetic yet vulgar film that is so unconventional yet so darkly humorous, with a cast that drives the film's engines for two and a half ingenious hours of marvellous and vivacious cinema. Tarantino's camera-work is praiseworthy, adapting an amateurish, scruffy look yet showing us exactly what we want to see, but leaves so much to the imagination. It is very interesting that we have generally received this film so highly. In fact we consider it as one of the best of all time and it probably is. Irrelevant yet so beautifully rejuvenating picture that is greatly entertaining, mystical and funny. An example that a film can be made with such limited resources and be so successful both critically and financially. Pulp Fiction drains the imagination, it uses it as its tool of success. This is a cinematic triumph, a milestone in the history of film. Tarantino is a genius; a mad genius but still a classified genius!!!-10/10-"

7 May 2019,Markie_Mark99,1,2,10,One of my favorites,"I am not a huge fan of Tarantino, but I love Pulp Fiction. It is so unique and weird and it's so fun to watch. It's the type of movie that you feel compelled to watch again because you think you missed something. Although there are multiple character plots going on at once, it all feels very streamlined and easy to follow. One of my favorites."
11 January 2015,joehemmings68,1,3,10,"Really Fun, Interesting Structure.","What's fantastic about Tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout. He does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things, which really helps the characters, and doesn't hinder performance in any way. He's absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue, and it really adds to it.Pulp Fiction feels vibrant. Pulp Fiction feels alive. And far from interminable, it knows exactly what direction it going in. It feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure, that doesn't feel convoluted at all. The story structure to me actually aids the ending, and the film as a whole. Incredibly clever stuff from Tarantino. Over time Tarantino films have become more and more bloated, but this and Reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films. To be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat. Performance wise I think everyone here is on top form. It's an interesting cast, and a brave cast, but it absolutely fits. I enjoyed Willis more than usual, as he seems more free and relaxed. Travolta is handled very well, which is something that I would have thought is very hard to do. His characters need to be tongue in cheek and that's certainly the case here.For me this is a film that can only really be done once. Doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling. I think few could pull this off, in fact I doubt even Tarantino could pull it off again. For bravery, creative spark, unique tone, awesome writing, and pure entertainment value, I can't not give this a ten.Ten out of Ten."
11 August 2013,Mudo675,1,1,7,"Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION","Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION, the new movie by Quentin Tarantino. Some may know Tarantino as the screenplay writer for TRUE ROMANCE or the writer-director of the critically acclaimed RESERVOIR DOGS, and just like those previous efforts the heart of PULP FICTION lies in Tarantino's brilliantly written conversations among the various characters. Dialogue fuels PULP FICTION to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character. Tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action, violence or special effects. You should note that the movie is shown in a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed independent film MYSTERY TRAIN, but this should not be an annoyance because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes that individually add up to one great movie."

                        ",A Tarantino favorite,"Quentin Tarantino sure knows how to put together a movie, huh? While, it will take you a couple of times to watch to decide whether you like it or not, Pulp Fiction is a unique film with top-class actors, grade-A acting, a superb storyline, and heaps of plot twists and turns.It's all about a web of people who's lives intertwine with eachother for various reasons. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson star as the two main characters, who turn in great performances, while Harvey Kietel and Uma Thurman are also great, but aren't in it as much.Bruce Willis is also great here as a boxer, on the run from a hitman, while Eric Stoltz plays one of Travolta's dope-smoking associates.Not a film for the slow-minded, 'Pulp Fiction' is a fast-paced adventure ride, that you'll laugh at, love and hate, all at the same time."

                        ",Depraved and entertaining,"A zany, violent, sexy, dissolute, funny flick!  Quirky and clever dialouge pervade this tumult of violence and decadence.  The characters are all incredible and each role is filled with a great actor/actress who obviously relishes the chance to perform in this movie.  The intertwined storylines are very sly and Tarantino was at the top of his game when he put this together.   However one sidenote to all the ladies: Pot bellies are NOT sexy on women."
13 February 2006,dcldan,0,2,9,Great film!,"This is one of the most exciting films I've ever seen, with a curious and, later, typical way to deal with the time in Tarantino's films. The story is divided (for say something) in three parts: the date between Mia (the wife of Marcellus, a very jealous mafia boss) and Vincent Vega (a gangster that works for Mia's husband); the escape of Butch (after stealing Marcellus), and the efforts of Jules and Vincent to clean his car of blood and brain pieces. Travolta has to thank to Tarantino to give him the opportunity to come back to the cinema, because his part is perfect and has effectively, returned him to the hall of fame of Hollywood. Superb script, with lots of memorable dialogs, full with dialectical an ethical argument, that contrast with the brutal and violent environment of the city. 2 hours and a half that passes by without noticing, due to its great direction and its great scenes of action and dialog. One of the best films in history? Maybe, however, its great violence can make it disgusting for lots of people..."

You can't get by forever writing the script on the same day of shooting while hung over.

It's a very clever movie, being rather simple om the surface, but adding something to the mix by making it about a bunch of interconnected stories out of order. The script and cinematography is amazing, and if you're into movies or other form of media, you catch a lot of references to previous works.All-in all, it's an incredibly funny and smart movie and a great example of Tarantino's potential!"

The Music is truly American and lines that the actors say is truly brilliant. Quentin Tarantino's Greatest film and maybe even the greatest movie of all time. The different story lines that cross make this film exciting and unpredictable.

Just like the other movies of Tarantino and my own fellow country man, Lars Von Trier, who has also been so over-praised by the critics! I would like to say, that I do find ""difficult"" films like the films of Kieslowski, Fassbinder etc. interesting, these films are about real characters... and not some overestimated roles. Well, we all have different tastes, including films, but until this moment, no one has ever been able to argue why Pulp Fiction is his/her personal favourite movie of all time, they always just say that this movie is so cool, exciting, interesting etc."
9 September 2019,cordenw,0,1,9,Brilliant,"It's gory , the plot is chopped up like a lot of the bodies, but it's a masterpiece of acting and storytelling.
Travolta, Jackson and Roth are so believable in their roles that you wouldn't want to run into them in the real world.
Tarantino, with his penchant for bloody scenes, has us walking through puddles of it throughout the movie but somehow it just consolidates the nature of these thugs and killers. They shoot someone and then go for a burger, don't give it a second thought!
Keitel is also brilliant in his portrayal of the ""fixer"" and makes it look like cleaning up a horrible mess is no more difficult than buying groceries. Tarantino himself has a great part and he too is just spot on.
It's difficult to praise a plot where most of the cast goes out shot in the face or blasted with a machine gun volley but if that's what the story must be, then this one's well done.
The sub plot with Rhames and Bruce Willis just makes the entire production that much better.

26 July 2003,akpiggott,1,2,10,Royale with Cheese...,"I went to Paris recently. Whilst walking down the famous Champs Elysees, I decided to check out the local MacDonald's just to see exactly what they do call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. To my disappointment, it wasn't ""Royale with Cheese"" (or should that read ""avec fromage""?) but something slightly different.. I forget what it was exactly, but that's not important...To call a movie like Pulp Fiction special is like... well.. it's special. A special movie. Masterpiece, even. Tarantino's script must rank among the sharpest and wittiest ever written. A lot of the dialogue is completely unnecessary as far as narrative goes, it does very little to forward the plot. Yet it is the dialogue that makes the movie so compelling and holds the interest of the audience just as well as any brilliantly told story could. This isn't to say that the movie has no decent narrative flow or substance to the story. Far from it. Tarantino's less than chronological way of telling this story makes it all the more intriguing. On first viewing, this may baffle viewers throughout most of the presentation. However, such a feeling just makes the final diner scene (where everything ties together) all the more satisfying. The three stories that are chronicled in this film are all unique, yet filled with the same brilliant drama and dark humour that wowed audiences of Tarantino's two previously penned films, Reservoir Dogs and True Romance.The characters in this movie are unforgettable and brilliantly written. Each and every event in the movie contributes greatly to the personality of each of them. By the end of it, we feel greatly acquainted with those that have the most limited screentime. They are backed up by a superbly talented all star cast. My two personal favourite performances being those of the fantastic Samuel L. Jackson (in a brilliant break-through role) as the wise-cracking hitman Jules Winnfield, and the legendary Harvey Keitel as the wonderfully odd fix-it man Winston Wolfe. Honourable mention should also go to the always outstanding Christopher Walken in his small but intriguing part as Captain Koons. Needless to say, the rest of the cast do Tarantino proud and all give some of the best of their career.At less than ten years old, Pulp Fiction is regarded as one of the finest of offerings in over a hundred years of cinema. It is one of the most important films of the twentieth century. Watch it, if you don't like it, keep watching it until you do. 9/10 (because I never give tens)."
23 February 2004,Old Joe,0,2,9,"Comment: Pulp: Soft, moist, formless mass of matter, a magazine which is made of poor quality paper and containing sensational stories. Fiction: Invention; invented statement or narrative; prose literature c","With a cult following around the world, a couple of years ago I thought I better get around to watching Pulp Fiction', and see what all the fuss was about. To my horror, I found this movie too sick and violent for my liking. Then just the other day I gave it a second chance and boy I am glad that I did. Pulp Fiction' is an inside look at a memorable community of criminals. This is one of the more unique pieces of cinema the world has ever seen.Prize-fighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby-sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realises that he must give up his life of crime.
The screenplay written for Pulp Fiction' by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avery is unusual and interesting at the same time. I like how Quentin made the story be out of chronological order, in addition to the way he cleverly changes the pace of the movie (e.g. from violent-humorous or vice-versa). Then there is also the very subtle use of humour in PF', which is another part of the script l like as well. Tarantino, I have read, used the humour to offset the violence that was about to, or has happened. Yet the script also holds some weird dialogue, for instance when Mia and Vincent are in the Diner, as I felt the first time it was really boring. A second viewing I can appreciate that it is a little different, not like your normal movie lingo. I am not surprised that this screenplay won an academy award, as it was very original. This movie has an all star line up. It resurrected the career of John Travolta who was on a downer before taking on the character of Vincent Vega in PF'. Travolta is good as the bad guy, as I also like his performance in the action hit, Broken Arrow'. Travolta shares an interesting, but bizarre chemistry with Uma Thurman, who plays Mia. The dance sequence the pair does at the burger diner has to go down as one of the great pieces of cinema I have seen. I know I will not forget it for along time to come. Thurman is also part of the movies most distressing scene, when her character accidentally OD's on heroine. What follows is quite unbelievable.
Vincent's mobster sidekick is Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), whose role is so serious that in some circumstances it has to be laughed at.  Jules always misquotes a bible passage, thinking that he has it right to the very word. The verse is Ezekiel 25:17'. I love how the script allows both Travolta and Jackson to make fun of what essentially are dangerous, violent and serious situations. They also share funny dialogue at the beginning of the film, as Vincent asks Jules, do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris? A Royale with Cheese.' The mob pair work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) who for most of the movie we only see the back of his head.  He is one of the more influential characters in the entire movie.
Then you have the character of Butch (played by action superstar Bruce Willis). He has been asked to throw a fight he is in, but doesn't, with the consequences of that being great. We also learn about the history of a wrist watch that his grandfather had in the war. One of the two great cameo performances in PF' comes from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells one of the movies funnier moments. The wrist watch is an important item to the movies make-up. The other is a bad guy by the name Jimmie (played by Tarantino himself). Tarantino is one guy who sure is involved when it comes to making a movie!I have to admit that I was not a fan of the contents of Pulp Fiction' when I first watched it. Yet three years on, I can see why many people like what it covers.  The violence (one of the main reason why I did not like it first time) is nowhere as bad I thought, as Tarantino cleverly cuts away to a different camera angle or too a completely different shot all together to make it a little less shocking. Yet it still has the same impact, as you know exactly what has happened.  Sure the bad guys use guns, but again they are used in such a way, that I could approve of them a second time around. There are many other deeper aspects to this movie that I have learnt to see and want too find more about. Early on in 2003 I was away with friends on the beach. At one stage I started drinking a can or two of alcohol. After an hour I was getting really happy, and started to dance like they do at the diner in Pulp Fiction'. Since that night I have wanted to watch the movie and see what I was mimicking. Quentin Tarantino has had what I believe is a positive influence on movies that we watch today. Sure he might push the envelope on what people like, but he also makes movies that are a little bit different, unlike the normal predictable' movie formulas. Tarantino also uses some extraordinary camera angles in Pulp Fiction, just great!  First time around, I would have only given Pulp Fiction a very small rating, however after many viewings, Pulp Fiction has shown me that it is a brilliant film, exceptionally well made by Tarantino.CMRS gives Pulp Fiction': 5 (Brilliant Film)"
30 July 2016,blainephillips,5,8,10,The best film I've ever seen,"Pulp Fiction has a little bit of everything in it. There's brilliant action scenes with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson. There's romance with Bruce Willis and his significant other. There's crime in the opening and closing scenes with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer. John Travulta and Samuel L Jackson are hilarious throughout the flick. On top of all this, the way the four stories intertwine in conclusion create a wonderfully thought out and executed film that I could just watch over and over again. I wish there was more movies like this. Perfect cast, perfect acting, brilliant dialogue, interesting story line. This is the movie that all other movies should be judged off of. ""It was a good movie, but not Pulp Fiction good."""
29 April 1999,coop-16,0,0,10,An intensely spiritual-and moral - film.,"Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time. One critic even called  it a ""glorification of two whacked out hit-men"".Others called it 'flippant', ""nihilistic' and ""cynical'. Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the ""pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption."
6 April 2006,freaky_dave,0,2,10,Holy Cow. One of the best movies of the 90s,"I'm not kidding about any of this. Pulp Fiction is indeed one of the best movies ever made. There are so many scenes in this movie that are memorable, I couldn't talk about them all without taking up way too much space.The dialogue in this film is magnificent. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta as hit men have most of the best lines, but they are not the only ones with incredible lines. We have Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken who has a small part but has dialogue which is just as good as Travolta's and Jackson's, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer. You get the idea.The plot revolves around a number of people, many mentioned above but not all, and how their paths cross in different ways. Each story, I think there are about three but there might be more, is mixed up, but everything comes together in a finale at a diner which makes complete sense and wouldn't have worked better any other way. Pulp Fiction begins and ends in almost the same time period, but we as the viewers know much more about the characters at the end that we didn't know when the movie first started. It was a clever idea which breathed new life into the gangster picture. Pulp Fiction's time twist was one that many other films followed with moderate success. The most recent being 2005s Sin City, another incredible film.Great scenes, Great dialogue, great characters, and a great story. This movie has it all and as directed by Quentin Tarantino is one of the best movies made in the 90s. It is definitely Tarantino's greatest achievement and should've won best picture in 1994."
21 September 2006,karl_consiglio,0,3,10,A classic my generation is to be remembered for,"How many times had i seen this movie after it came out? The first time was at the cinema alone with a bucket of popcorn. Quality time, loved it, it sucked me in immediately, loved every second of it and eventually studied the whole thing every notch and cranny over and over, I knew the whole script by heart. Bought the movie to have it at home along with the soundtrack, a real Pulp Fiction geek I was. Great cast, great script, this movie has a shape of it own and I think that this is the film which welcomed Travolta back. But if I had to choose a part to play in this movie I would choose the part of the Wolf, Harvey Keitel's part, so so cool. I like how in this movie we know we are in America but we are not entirely sure where. This is one cool movie, a real classic, a true star. Very clever film making."
24 November 2021,passenger70,1,5,8,Seinfeld with guns.,Unpopular opinion but Tarantino is not a cinema director. Every scene he writes is like a sitcom scene where characters argue like little Fonzies over the dinner table. This movie is entertaining but can't maintain more than short 30 minute bursts before moving onto the next argument over a passed out gangster's wife. The saving grace is Samuel Jackson's revelatory speech to Tim Roth in the films final episode. That and the fantastic premature freeze frame on Amanda Plummer that precedes the film's credits.
3 July 2011,bigplatts,1,2,10,THE movie of the 90s,"The movie that shot director Quentin Tarantino into popularity, pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created.The film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase, Uma Thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with Trovolta, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters, ands Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple robbing a diner. The plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting.The film features most Tarantino trademarks, including his normal chunky dialogue, with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here. The films also not shy on action and there's loads of surprises throughout the movie(although I wont spoil anything).Acting wise, pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history. Jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man, while Trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career. Thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss. The supporting cast is strong with Harvey Keitel playing the gangster expert and even Tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role.But thats not the only reason PF is so great, its everything about it. The soundtrack is classic Tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story. While the camera work is some of the best since the films release. And the film just keeps on giving, from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie, to its hilarious middle acts, to its hugely satisfying conclusion.As it stands, pulp fiction is still one of the funniest, darkest, most enjoyable and most creative films ever. If you haven't seen the film yet then I can't recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can. A true classic."
20 April 2014,saytosandeep,0,1,8,MY REVIEW: Delicious QT Work of Fiction!!,"Pulp Fiction. It's not your ordinary movie, it defies the conventions, it is an experiment which became a style of film making. It does not respect the silence, it fills the empty spaces with long and irrelevant but delicious conversations on hamburger, foot massage, act of God etc. Narrated in non-linear or should I say circular fashion where first scene and last scene meet each other at the end and there are scenes between them that define the whole story. There is a whole array of quirky characters played by wonderful talents like Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman. The screenplay is filled with unpredictable events, surprising coincidences, characters who are not related to each other but impact each others lives significantly. So much like Sin City and Fight Club, Pulp Fiction is a unique and amazing experiment of film making that is destined to be studied forever. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Pulp Fiction. More likely, at first viewing, you won't be able to understand this movie's purpose but after repeated viewing you would appreciate the fact that there was no purpose at all."
16 August 2008,kyle-cruse,0,1,8,Gets better the more I see it,"""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those films that starts to grow on me because I fall in love with a few particularly good scenes. I do not consider the whole movie to be enjoyable to watch, as some scenes (such as the ones with Bruce Willis running from his boxing opponent and the scenes after John Travolta kills a man by mistake) are just brutal and are no fun to watch. However, when I consider the more entertaining scenes, like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta having normal conversations on their way to do their job as hit men (making them seem like ordinary people, as they truly are), or the entertaining date scene with John Travolta and Uma Thurman, I realize that this film is full of little humorous, entertaining, and brilliant scenes that make it a pretty good film overall. The finest thing about this film, in my opinion, is the final scene in the diner. I was completely surprised to find out that this film has somewhat of a redemptive message, a choice that Samuel L. Jackson must make after witnessing what he calls a supernatural event. That was powerful. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent in their roles, and both steal the scene whenever they are on. Not all of this film is good, but these scenes I've mentioned and several others make it worthwhile and fun. You may want to watch it more than once, as this film is somewhat of an acquired taste, and you won't realize how good it is until you've seen it a few times. If you do not want to see such strong violence or hear so many ""f"" words, as I don't, some TV stations occasionally show this film with those areas toned down. It's much easier to watch that way.*** out of ****"
9 May 2013,bigcahs93,1,2,10,"A champion of non-linearity, dialog, and art-house film.","Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. Staring Jon Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as two B.A.M.F's and Bruce Willis as Butch. Let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie. I've seen Pulp more than any other movie, in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for Pulp. That being said, Tarantino really showed that he's got game in this film. Many people say that he's just a really big fan simply 'steals' shots from other directors, and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots, but Tarantino manages to make it his own every time. Even if the set up is exactly the same, the shots he uses are able to stay 'Tarantino- esque'. Its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out, as the cinematography, editing, sound, story, acting, and even the wardrobe stands out. What makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story. Its non-linear, its almost aggressively non-linear. For years i've been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean, i'm sure there's something there, but i haven't really been able to figure it out. That being said though, it doesn't hold the movie back. At the end of the day, this movie is everything a good movie could be. Go watch it, go obsess over it, go talk about it, go go go! 10/10"
6 November 2021,bretttaylor-04022,0,0,10,Heavily influenced movie that became Heavily influential.,"There is not a scene that has not been parodied or copied. There is not a song on the soundtrack that hasn't been covered, sampled or used in some crappy advert after its release. I feel like I have heard every bit of dialogue used in my normal everyday life by someone in the last 25 years. Yes it has a myriad of influences that the basic audience does not get and comes across as totally original to them but it is not ripping them of it is a unique mixture of Noir and dark comedy which many have tried to copy since and some have been awful and some have been good but none as good as this."

10 May 2019,PCT1970,0,1,9,I'll Tell Ya What Was In That Suitcase,"Tarantino's second feature film is one of the very best crime dramas ever. It is also one of the most quoted, hippest and pop culture favorite films. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. All the actors involved deliver perfect pulp magazine performances. In particular Travolta, Thurman and Jackson stand out. Travolta and Jackson's philosophical discussion scenes are pure hilarity. Travolta and Thurman's dance scene is unforgettable. The plot revolves around two hit man whose main storyline is interwoven with their gangster boss, the boss' actress wife, a struggling boxer, a fixer and two armed robbers. All the characters stories are perfectly constructed and come full circle. The plot is intense, clever, funny, gritty, violent, gripping, has twists and is unparalleled. The word pulp is derived from cheap wood paper on which Pulp Magazines, also known as Pulps, were printed. This film is like a Pulps in a different medium. To this day fans of this film memorized and can quote Jackson's, ""Ezekiel 25:17"" in it's entirety. One of the biggest mysteries in the film is what is in the suitcase? There have been many theories. This viewer's theory is as simple as a Pulps. I believe it was Taratino indicating that there was gold, as in the form of a certain award, that was emitting the glow. This film is memorable and remains one of the very best and most unique in it's genre."

                        ",Spectacular!,"I heard rumours about this highly acclaimed movie called Pulp Fiction, for the longest time. Finally I couldn't take it any more and decided to give it a whirl. one word summary of the film: spectacular! The movie revolves around a group of killers, a big boss, his wife, a crooked boxer and a pair of dangerous British lovers involved in close call, bone chilling, heart pounding tales of chaos and mayhem. Director/Writer Quentin Tarantino uses his brilliant tallents to give us another winner. Although not for the anti-violence fans, Pulp Fiction is garunteed to impress all who have witnessed Tarantino's other hit, Reservoir Dogs. Action fans behold, a rare piece of art that sets the standards for today's gangster flicks.9.0/10"
23 May 2000,len-21,0,1,8,8 on a scale of 10,"This was an intensely violent movie. I had no problems with that. Overall, it was very well made and interesting to watch. I liked the actors and the acting. No surprise a very high percentage of people here give it a 10 or 9.My problem with it was that 1) it wasn't perfect, thus a 9 and 2) it wasn't linear, thus an 8. I like movies that have a beginning, middle and end. This movie was all over the map. It essentially ended (chronologically) where it began, but not before bouncing around in the future and the past with no road map.I realize that many people liked the fact that it was different in this respect. I like different, that just isn't one of the differences I like."
9 May 2018,kennykip,1,2,10,pulp fiction,Personally one of my favorite films this movie encases all kinds of different techniques and sort of confuses the viewer until a certain point where the story all starts to connect. i believe that this movie addresses all aspects of american life and what it means to be an american in this day and age. from references to Big Macs and other staple in current american culture this film never has a slow scene and their is always a surprise just around the corner.
17 December 2009,k-cronin,1,3,10,Tarantino.... what else needs to be said?,"Hands down, one of my favorite movies of all time. I have been a huge QT fan for a long time now, (probably since the first time I have seen Reservoir Dogs) but this movie blew me out of the water. There are so many different aspects to this movie. So many different camera shots, so many different cameos from different movies. QT has this amazing way of telling a movies plot in chapter form and leaving it up to the audience to figure it out. Its so hard to even walk away during one of his movies to go to the bathroom because you are scared you are going to miss some important part of the movie. And believe me, every since frame of his movies are so important to the over all story line. I loved this movie, ground making, must watch, awesome movie!"
20 April 2015,sandnair87,0,0,9,Tarantino Pounds Mirth And Mayhem into An Outrageously Funny Postmodern Pulp!,"Quentin Tarantino's mesmeric Pulp Fiction is a slow dance on the killing ground, a prodigious horror-comedy spun out with such ferocious comic glee and buoyancy that belie its seeming cruelty. Superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern Los Angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of Tarantino's own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyone's going or why – creating a sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. The structure itself is wickedly ingenious: Three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. Most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (Bruce Willis), an obsessive war veteran (Christopher Walken), a mob boss's jaded wife (Uma Thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) - but Tarantino's approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. By and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for Tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. Their tales all start slowly, but soon everyone's destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. Stuff happens in Pulp Fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but Tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. Unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. The tension Tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. It's hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. The entire cast, like Tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives.Pulp Fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that Tarantino isn't just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. There is a moral core in Pulp Fiction too- a subversive one. But ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. Despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, Pulp Fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. It's fluff!"
4 May 2019,Ongoer1,1,2,10,"One word, Outstanding","Royale with cheese anyone? Every part of this Tarantino film is beautifully done. Even when you are just watching a scene that involves two characters talking to each other, the writing and the acting is done so well you find yourself wondering why other films aren't like this. The killer soundtrack that is perfectly paired with each scene keeps you locked in throughout. The perfectly timed flashbacks, use of chapters, and the skill of merging multiple storylines into one shows the talent of Tarantino. I can watch this movie 100 times in a row and find something new to appreciate every time, it's just that enjoyable and well made."

                        ",Check out the Big Brain on Brett!!,"Truly a classic.  A movie with long scenes, and they're all well played (believable or not). 
One minute you're laughing, the next scared s---less.  When Jules blasts ""Flock of Seagulls"" on the couch while Brett quakes in his boots digesting a ""Big Kahuna"" burger, the laughter & fright seem simultaneous.  
Often imitated, & certainly never duplicated, this is (to quote John Cusack's Rob Gordon character in ""High Fidelity"") in my ""Top 5 movies of The 90's""."
12 December 2004,rosaishere,1,3,10,Best film ever made,"Well one lonely night downstairs, with the parents up in bed this film came on, and without warning I found myself watching. By the end I was blown and away and I instantly went out and bought it.This is without a doubt the most original film I have ever seen. Packing a superb cast and great hairstyles this movie is bouncy and enjoyable. Every character in it has superb lines, written by the genius Quentin Tarainto. Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion delivers the best performance as the afro bible bashing Jules. It's only a pity he didn't win the Oscar for his performance. While although some people may feel the film drags, and lacks action - most of the joy is to be found in the words. Behold characters in this film engage in conversation! A fact regularly left out from Hollywood films of today, these characters freely discuss burgers, drugs and pancakes at will, without the need to be tied down to a monotone script delivering boring word after word. I rate this film as highly as possible, it is only a pity Quentin Tarainto is slightly diverting from his gangster roots of reservoir dogs and pulp fiction, but I defiantly support him in his future work."
13 December 2019,thedarkhorizon,0,2,6,"The not-so-deep, cleverly constructed flick that changed movie history (obviously) forever.","Disclaimer: this review is totally based on my personal opinion and most likely won't help the unprejudiced viewer a lot.Personally, I enjoyed the 2,5 hours with (nearly) no message at all. I had to see the film as it is such a 'must know' in film history - but I was never a Tarantino fan with too much dialogue and way too much violence.Of course, I understand that the dialogues are well sculpted, leaving out all boring bits and being deep, relatable and entertaining at the same time. The characters are not exactly like-able but feel relatable (which is a skill, too).For me, personally, I did not find a lot of meaning in the film, no bigger picture or moral - not even too many riddles to solve (apart from ""what's in the suitcase...""). I found some interpretations stating that the movie is about ""redemption"" (things happening out of pure luck / coincidence; bullets missing targets, men running accidentally into each other, ... - which brings to the question ""What is fate?""). I like that idea a lot, but am not sure if Tarantino went that far himself.I liked the concept of having a ripped story line where the audience has to puzzle the pieces together himself afterwards - I think it keeps the story interesting throughout the (intended) slow parts. In terms of 'how to tell a story' it is not an ordinary thing and helps to stay engaged.Overall, visually speaking, the scenes and colors and picture style are very vibrant, dynamic and generate a fictional, americanized, lower society world that feels super relatable (the ordinary diner, ....).My favorite part of the movie was the ""Jack Rabbit Slim's"" diner part with the extravagant set / decoration and concept.
I know there are a lot Tarantino fans out there for millions of reasons (and yes, the movie is made of skill and uniqueness!), but I would not watch it again, as I did not enjoy it as much as I am most likely 'supposed to'."
14 July 1999,RIK-22,0,5,2,"Some good acting and dialog, but very boring","I don't want to be rude to anyone as we've all got different opinions, but, if you really watch this film it's very boring.Just like Casino, if you stuff some good actors together and come up with some interesting bizarre scenes and some unusual dialog (with no point) it doesn't make a movie.  How about having a story, a point, perhaps.This is one of the few films that actually sends me to sleep.  Take the scene with Bruce Willis.  Could that drawn out boring scene have taken any longer - Dull!!!I, Personally, go to see a movie to be entertained, shocked, moved or informed.  This movie did none of that.  Of course I'm people will say ""you just don't understand the brilliance"".  Just because someone makes an 'Arty' picture doesn't mean you have to pretend to like it even when it's boring.I suspect in the future, when all the hypes forgotten, people will ask, ""why did anyone like that film""."

                        ",Esily one of the best films I have ever seen,"This is on of those films that come along ad you are awe-inspired by it, the performances are brilliant, the direction is brilliant, and Samuel L Jackson is amazing. What a film, couldn't help but ask my friends had they seen the film, because I needed to talk about it.Tarantino i well renowned for his script writing talents and a now a classic example of how good he is will be pulp fiction. Some of the things they talk about seem quite fruitless, 'do you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?' and there s a marvellously shot sequence where travlota ad Thurman are doing a dance off and then later on travolta sticking an adrenaline needle into her heart, what a strange night that would have been, if that had happened to you!!!! I thought Samuel L Jackson performance was brilliant and he probably had the most memorable lines of the film with the passage taken from Ezekiel. Quality film, brilliantly shot, maybe the best Tarantino film I have seen, even though I did adore Kill Bill vol. 1. Go see it for those who haven't."
24 June 2008,cosmorados,0,3,9,One of the top ten films of the Nineties,"Two people chat in a diner about their previous life of crime and the fact that robbing convenience stores is extremely dangerous, with more and more owners getting wise and arming up, however, punters in restaurant very often have more money and put up less of a fight. The language is coarse and quite off putting and when the credits kick in this continues with music that is an affront to the senses, unsettling them with huge brass sections that curdle the ears and batter the senses.Cut to, Vincent and Jules, two hired goons sent to receive an object from a bunch of kids who are clearly dealing with people that they are out of their depth with. What follows is one of the most amazing and memorable film moments of the last 20 years as Samuel L Jackson gives his famous eulogy from the biblical passage Ezekial 25:19. From this point on we are exposed to the crime underbelly of America, an area which wants to do all it can to make money, an area immune from the law where people can do what they want without worry of prosecution or the law, Bruce Willis plays Butch, a boxer who the Crime Lord, Marcellus Wallace, is attempting to buy. After a brief encounter with Vincent Vega at the bar, what then begins in earnest are three very different stories The first story is Vincent and Mia's, where Vincent is asked to take Marcellus' wife out for the night while he is away. What follows is a night out that represents both the best and worst night out you could possibly ask for This is followed by the story of the Gold Watch and is Butch's tale about what happens in the fight and the immediate aftermath for all parties. This is arguably the funniest of the three stories, but that does not take away from the fact that it is still horrific.The last story is the story of Jules and if the highlight of the film with one of the greatest scripted moments of all time as Jules explains to Ringo, clearly and concisely about who he is, what he is and what the world is all about, it is chilling, it is amazing, it is breath taking, and I remember leaving the cinema with a feeling that I'd not had since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" like someone experiencing cinema for the first time, which I guess the best cinema does.The writing here is superb and had a profound effect on cinema with a lot of Tarentino style knock-offs coming after, but none quite matched this. The Direction is inventive and savage and as I mentioned previously seems to batter the senses, and yet the climactic ending is perfect in its subtle portrayal of a man who clearly understands his place in the world and is struggling to get out of it.John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all fantastic, but Sam Jackson as Jules is simply perfect and to watch him as Jules experience something that logic clearly cannot explain and what it means to him, is something that is, well truly profound, and, as with a lot of Tarentino films, there is a very moral message lurking within the core of evil that seems to suffocate everything and everyone in the film. People complain that certain elements are homophobic, but their are gay criminals as well as straight and the way I see it is that we shouldn't be afraid to show both, after all, no-one complains about straight people being portrayed as criminals.This is a great film that I believe will last the test of time, its performances are brilliant, although it is worth the time of watching just for Sam Jackson's performance alone and while Jackie Brown's subtlety make it a more enjoyable watch, this will be the film for which Tarentino will always be remembered, even though his star may fade over time."
2 September 2011,ajit2106,0,2,9,A complete cinema,"When we talk about Cinema, ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the Cinema.One of the best movies ever made. You will love to watch it 1000 times and still crave for some more viewings.It starts up again the non-linear story telling after Short Cuts (1993) with three stories entwined and told in a whimsical fashion.You will listen to and understand the real rhetorical skill. The conversation has the power to evoke a sense of sentence construction be it complex or compound with entangled profanity.Each and every character has its own emblem and leaves a stamp on your heart forever.The violence and mayhem depicted is of has the highest value and set a standard, it looks definitive with sheer use of perfect camera angles.Quentin Tarantino has a different mechanism or technical aspects of doing something wonderfully; he will always be appreciated for his work. ""In fact Quentin is Genre"".A masterpiece which will remain in your hearts and minds whenever we converse about Cinema."
16 November 2015,joannaadams,4,6,10,Masterpiece,"Black comedy told through the framework of the omnibus, ""Pulp Fiction"" is without any doubt one of the best and most important films of all time, a masterpiece that has its aesthetics, juicy dialogue and unpredictable acting division greatly influenced by the explosion of the so-called indie cinema in the mid-nineties. we have four weakly related stories in a linear jumps. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino kind of wanted to emphasize that the most important thing in every movie is the story and the dialogue, but also to raw material itself without the original prescription can not provide anything more valuable than short-term fun. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the titles that we never get bored."

                        ","Captain Koons, My Hero","Everyone knows that this is one of the most innovative films of the last several decades. Everyone knows that the dialogue is great, and that the non-linear narrative structure is unique and ground-breaking.  And as much attention as Travolta and Samuel L. get, which is deserved, I must say that Christopher Walken's scene in the movie is my favorite. I would go so far as to say that I think it is the best monologue in history. Sorry Shakespeare, not even ""to be or not to be"" could ever be as perfect as Captain Koons' story of the Gold Watch.  Anyone who doesn't agree should be shaved and sterilized.  Is that Edward Towers?"
17 December 2015,QHChaos,4,6,10,"Perfection, A Boys Dream Film","As this is one of my most favourite films of all time, my opinion will be completely bias. However nothing can compete to this masterpiece that Tarantino created. Drugs, Money, Guns and a couple of bad-ass 'motherfuckers'.Just the right amount of each to keep 99% of people entertained. What I love too is the serious dark humour infused into the chaos, it makes you question yourself if it is funny or not. But that is what makes it a Tarantino classic. If you haven't watched this film already it needs to go straight to your watch list. I first saw this when I was 13 and I watch it at least once a year. Maybe it isn't to EVERYONE's taste but if you ever find yourself with a couple hours free time. WATCH THIS..."
11 March 2008,nowtheworldisgone,1,2,10,The Masterpiece of Quentin Tarantino,"It has never happened to watch such a masterpiece by Tarantino so entertaining. It is not a film which has a direct theme. It is a film in which you can find everything such as drama, thriller, comedy, crime What is so tempting about this film is also that, all the characters are very fitting with their creators. For example, it is even impossible not to be in love with Mia Wallace because Uma Thurman rescued her so successful that she gives the impression to you. Likewise Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson made a very good job. This movie shows the distinctions between choosing the bad and the good one. Vincent Vega reflects a life style which seems very funny but dangerous on the other hand Jules Winnfield shows a life style which has a lot of biases and rules. Throughout the film, amusement never disappears. It is a must see production so that it has become a classic already."

5 September 2009,VerdantGreen,1,2,10,A Genre of it's Own,"When I think about what makes a film good, I base that on whether it has the ability to do either of the following things: be entertaining or be thought-provoking. Some films rely almost solely on the entertainment aspect, such as Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow whereas others require lots of thought and study i.e 2001 or practically anything by David Lynch. Pulp Fiction achieves both these aspects to the extreme.The film contains a decent number of scenes where the characters have lengthy conversations about every day, generally mundane topics which may sound boring but trust me it's definitely not. Quentin Tarantino is an expert at film dialogue, the characters in this film could be talking about something like paint drying and still have you clinging onto every word that they say. None of these characters are stereotypes in any way. For example, I'll try not to give anything away, but in one scene you have two hit men having a conversation about fast food joints just before they commit a brutal murder.This film has been analysed and pondered for at least fifteen years now and there are still aspects of the film which no-one can even begin to comprehend. Nevertheless, this film is still hugely watchable. Even with it's sometimes painful scenes of graphic violence and downright human depravity. But don't let that put you off, Pulp Fiction is a rich cinematic experience and a film that you won't easily forget. A definite must see.10/10 - Classic"
10 May 2006,teh_mode,0,1,10,Revolutionary 1990s cool,"Watching Pulp Fiction for the first time is like discovering a new type of music that'll soon be sweeping every wannabe-cool DJ's airwaves. Watching it for a second time makes you realise just how formulaic and mundane all those seminars and handbooks about ""How to write a Hollywood script"" really are. I don't want to criticise the Robert McKee class of Scriptwriting, we all know that we need the occasional ""Mission: Impossible"" to tickle our funny bone rather than our minds, but you don't have to be a genius, or indeed a scriptwriter, to work out that Pulp Fiction really is a true work of art. A film that, despite all it's obvious inspirations, was such an original film, not least one of the most important of the 1990s, spawning all kinds of replicas, inspirations and wannabe filmmakers. The celebration of junk food, bad hair and kitsch cool could never be told with as much fizz or energy as in Tarantino's second coming.In the film's opening we meet Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deliberating in a diner about how no one ever sticks-up restaurants. ""Bars, liquor stores, you'll get your head blown off stickin' up one of them!"" Roth says, in his south London twang. He has a point too. They decide to rob the place they're in. If only they knew of the consequences. In fact, if only ALL the characters knew what they were doing. Pulp Fiction is an endless show of people f'ing things up. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play a pair of 70s-hyperbole laden hit men. A similar set up to the previous scene has our protagonists talking about nothing in particular - burgers, pot, what they put on fries in Paris - then launching into a violent tirade among their now pursued yuppie friends, who obviously owe money to the two hit men's boss. It is a shocking switch of tone, one that works seamlessly, and sums up how well Tarantino and Avary can write. It also shows how violence is simply a way of life for these men. And with all this in mind, authenticity is still right at the back of your mind; Pulp Fiction is a movie about old movies, not real life. Everything from the blazing soundtrack to Jackson's hideously groovy afro to the incredibly simple story lines - a boxer throws a fight, but must get his father's watch back before the gangsters find it, a body must be dumped before the wife gets home, a woman OD's and must be resuscitated before the her husband (the boss) finds out - is a one huge jollification of everything trashy but cool.And what of the now infamous cast that Tarantino so delicately hired to work his script? John Travolta has had so many revivals in his fluctuating career, but this role showed us such a new spin on the Travolta ball. He is great as the stoner hit-man, who gets himself in deep waters with the boss' woman, played by an equally impressive Uma Thurman, who nails the moll wife exquisitely - complete with 20s style hair and an irresistible underlying seduction. We all know what Bruce Willis is capable of when he puts his acting chops to the test, and able assistance is given by the likes Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken (in one the movies' funniest scenes) and Tim Roth. But it is Samuel L. Jackson who walks away as the new star in Hollywood. With His explosive and dynamic turn as the fast talking, god-fearing partner-in-crime of Vincent Vega, Jules, he delivers most of the movie's many memorable lines, and epitomises the effortlessness of Tarantino cool: He is bold, funny, explicit and explosive. His lack of Oscar at that years' ceremony should have been filed under the human rights act.A comic book of comedy with enough one-liners to keep the QT devotees annoyingly quoting until it may just seem a bit too good to be true, Pulp Fiction, even now - with all the time we've had to wrap it up and endure it's obvious imitators - still seems fresh. A film like no other, despite it's obvious homages to Godard, film-noir and blaxploitation. It's pretty easy to dismiss his work as violent trash, but yet look at the recipients of all the bad deeds in the film: the ones who ""see the light"" as it were are the ones who succeed, the ones who continue to fall foul to the bad ways of life are the ones who pay for it in the end (one such unlucky character ends up in a rather unenviable position between a redneck rapist and his gun toting partner). In the end, it is a very simple collection of stories about redemption, about people who get themselves in horrible, yet hilarious, situations and have to arduously dig themselves out. Its legacy is indisputable. Its value is priceless. You haven't seen anything until you see Pulp Fiction."

7 February 2008,paluso7,4,7,10,God's gift to movies,This is the best movie I have ever seen. I first saw this movie when I was 11. And from that point on I wanted to be a movie maker. Mr. Tarantino is a god among mortals. His vision is so beyond words. A lot of people say this movie is overrated. I say you are stupid if for one second you think this film is garbage. I love every aspect of this movie from beginning to end. I like how Tarantino used a non linear plot line. It just fits the mold so good. When I was 11 I herd a little about pulp fiction some said it was a good movie. I saw it and was in shock in how amazing it was. I just want to say if you are looking for a great movie in every aspect see this movie that god had blessed himself.
23 September 2013,argo0403,1,2,10,This is Tarantino,"I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them.It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected.Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect  his possessions.   First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus.  Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose.  Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve.  Epilogue is also them at a restaurant.If there's a word describes this movie, it must be ""crazy"" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness.  I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but  For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger!The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing!This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting.After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again."
24 August 2016,auguste_24,1,2,10,Like a puzzle,"Quentin Tarantino is known for his dialogue that makes a normal conversation interesting, his characters are opinionated and that adds to it all. Pulp fiction is a highlight of that talent because this is a film that breaths characters. Characters are an important part of this story because there is many to choose from. Tarantino expertly controlled this wide and wacky cast of characters effectively.What is also great about this movie is the structure it's told in, it's up to you the viewer to decide what is going on and that makes for a fun watch the first time around.The performances are great, the camera-work is acceptable but the writing is the hero in this movie. The conversations these characters have are the most memorable parts of the movie.Overall, this is a movie you have seen but if you haven't check it out and you will love it."
4 January 2000,claudonio,0,0,10,A Very Unique Film Masterpiece,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a very unique masterpiece,there has never been a movie like it before and there will never be another film like this. This film changed hollywood movie making forever by being original and audatious. The entire cast of this fiolm gives knockout performances especially Samuel L. Jackson, who helps deliver some outstanding dialouge."
4 September 2007,Seagalogist,1,3,10,The greatest movie of all time,"For a film to be this good is depressing. The words perfection and legendary are thrown around to frequently nowadays but this movie is perfect. It already has legendary status, but its reputation will only further grow as the years pass. Tarantino is a little eccentric, but he is a genius no doubt and the best director of all time. Also add in the great cast...Bruce Willis(very underrated), Sam Jackson(So unique), Uma Thurman(Great actress), Harvey Keitel(legendary supporting actor). This movie revived careers, and changed lives. It changed the way people make movies. How it didn't win every prize and award that year is beyond me. Still, the Palm D'Ór is a fair achievement! If you see one movie before you die, see this!"
16 May 2018,SandyAren,1,2,8,Funny gangsters movie,"The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. It is a little bit to long, but I can say it is Tarantino style to show everything in a little bit slow motion manner. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. 8/10"

The lives of Jules, Vincent, Marcellus, Mia, Butch, Wolf, all wrap up together so well, you'd think the story was based on an award winning novel.  Quentin Tarantino is probably the most creative writer/director in Hollywood.  And I love the story and the acting of Pulp Fiction, but still, this was a horrible movie."

                        ",Pulp Nonfiction,"The layout of this film was quite interesting. By not watching the events in chronological order, you get a distorted view of things - which makes things work in a movie like this. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make a good team, while Bruce Willis plays his role very well. Unfortunately, the movie gets boring after a while and the senseless violence and graphic scenes are thrown in to get a rise out of audiences. I would never want to see this movie again, and would only recommend to people who are blown away by rock'n'roll movies, and the other simplistic things life has to offer."
31 May 1999,DanB-4,0,0,9,A Refreshing Assault on the Senses,"One of the best independent film ever made, Pulp Fiction is a towering achievement while not really being any good at all. It is a dirty, edgy film which is essentially about nothing other than what it feels like to be in this situation. It is reminiscent of Goodfellas, which has that same almost documentary-like feel to it, and has no definable plot.At the centre of this film however is the acting. Quentin Tarantino draws every ounce of life out of each character and creates an endless series of freaks that you would love to study , but would never want to know. A lot of talk surrounded John Travolta's Oscar loss in this film to Tom Hanks, but it was Samuel L. Jackson who was robbed. He eats the screen alive in every scene - the most famous being in the diner at the end but the best being the hit on Brett (""Check out the big brain on Brett"") in the first scene after the credits. Even Bruce Willis fits his role as a scheming low-life boxer perfectly.The non-linear story telling and campy feel to this movie work, and make it come across like a crude mating of a 70's cop show, blaxpoitation and a soap opera. But the sharp, witty, original and daring screenplay never misses it's target and not a single scene comes off as forced or awkward.The violence in this movie got a lot of attention at its release, but you cannot convince me that it has anything worse than an episode of NYPD Blue. It really is not that violent. The scenes with Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and ""the gimp"" are truly offensive and tough to watch, but they are not that violent. That being said, the f-shots in this movie are countless.When you first view Pulp Fiction, so much is thrown at you in such an unconventional way that you may well dislike the film. Give it a second or even third chance. It is well worth it. Pay close attention to the cameos - they make the film. **** out of ****."
13 April 2018,allisonbazanos,1,2,10,Absolute favorite movie,My favorite movie of all time. Everyone must see. I love absolutely everything about this movie from the script to the actors to the quick switches of scenes. It keeps your focus through the whole thing and is hilariously funny and forever quotable.
4 January 2016,donaba13,1,1,10,Love it.,"Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."
8 May 2019,quinncoccetti,1,2,10,AWESOME FILM!!!,"This film is great for a number of reasons. The soundtrack is one reason because it's full of classic rock songs that really fit the mood of the scenes in which they appear in. Tarantino does an excellent job at providing non diegetic sound to capture the feel of each scene. The acting is also great in this film. Samuel L Jackson is very scary yet hilarious and you really believe he is the character in real life. The quick cuts and different camera angles Tarantino uses in this film add to the mood of the film. The quick cuts help tell the audience that this is a fast and exciting movie. Overall, i loved this movie and recommend it to anyone and everyone."

                        ",it's the dialogue,"Now Quinten Tarantino is my 2nd favorite director (first being Martin Scorsese), and I think what makes his movies so great is the dialogue. Throughout the whole movie superb dialogue takes place just before, or right after a turning point in the movie. Now I'm not saying it would have been bad if the dialogue wasn't there, it still would have been a good movie, but the conversations about things that are totally trivial make this an excellent flick! Not for the faint of heart, but for anyone else, because this is one of the great films in American cinema! 10/10"
27 August 2009,davidjszymanski-1,4,7,10,Horribly tense and darkly humorous,"I was very impressed with Pulp Fiction, upon seeing it for the first time recently. Right down to the nitty gritty: Pulp Fiction specializes in sharp and darkly humorous dialog which builds up almost unbearable suspense, culminating in sudden violence. In particular, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta provide a nearly endless supply of memorable quotes (most of which can't be repeated in polite company). The plot itself is rather fragmented, but fairly easy to follow. The violence can be brutal (in particular, one headshot results in a bloody mess all over a car's back window), but is much more toned down than in Kill Bill, and is relatively infrequent. Unfortunately, the movie whole-heartedly embraces some things that viewers might find offensive. Male Rape makes a brief appearance, as well as an implied torture (which we never see), explicit drug use, and an F-bomb count that I swear exceeds the total number of minutes in the movie.In the end, though, Pulp Fiction ends on a positive note, and doesn't leave you feeling unhappy and dirty. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end, and a brilliant one at that."
23 December 2002,lilkbraptor15,1,3,10,The best movie ever made,"Pulp fiction is the best movie ever made.  From start to finish, I was glued to the edge of my seat...all 2.5 hours of it...John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, and cannot forget Bruce Willis, all had tremendously excellent performances.  Travolta and Jackson playing Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, two mobster assassins who work for Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames.  Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace, Marsellus' wife, and Bruce Willis plays Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter who was supposed to throw a fight but actually ended up winning, and now he's trying to get away from Marsellus.  Ok, I don't want to say anything else.....just watch the damn movie, it's that good...it's that great....it's that awesome...Before last night, i haven't even seen Pulp Fiction but then I decided to buy the Collector's Edition dvd that's truly awesome.  Trust me....You will not see a better movie in your lifetime.  And as for Pulp being ranked at #20 on IMDB is garbage.  It should at least be in the top 5...ohh wait...forget top 5...it should be #1.  Godfather is a great movie that really has it's moments but it does get dull in many parts.....I truly recommend that you see this movie...you will not be disappointed100,000,000,000,000/10"
4 February 2019,wisemantonofski,0,1,10,A Masterful Piece of Film,"The use of language and dialogue in film is the predominant weapon of the director, the most direct form of story-telling available to get their message across and nowhere is this more evident than in Quentin Tarantino's dark comedy about hitmen, criminals and drug addicts. So many stories carefully interwoven into a narrative which flows so artistically from act to act and featuring some of the greatest talents in Hollywood, from John Travolta to Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a thrill ride from start to finish to the point where you almost wish it would keep going after the credits roll. Pulp Fiction is to film what Queen is to rock music, its a masterclass in the art of character development and dramatic timing and it gets better on every viewing."

The middle which is the end, and that's where there character arc is.The character exposition of Jules and Vincent are held back like a scroll about to unravel, however it finally does starting with THE BONNIE SITUATION after the FADE OUT when Butch rides with Fabienne.By the way, may I say that the amplifying of the music when Butch settles the score with the rapist mofo and the cop was used to great effect. Loved it.Full of streetsmart patter, sometimes funny, sometimes tooON THE NOSE-y but never dull.Jules bares his surface at the last scene in the cafeteria. Very funny. Very intense.

3 April 2003,ron_72180,1,3,10,The best movie I have ever seen,"Pulp Fiction, in my opinion, is the Citizen Kane of our generation. It contains so much: gritty crime drama, at times hysterical humor, edge of your seat suspense, incredible acting, and hard to forget scenarios. I think this movie got completely robbed in the Oscar race losing pretty much everything to the highly overrated Forrest Gump. Gump was okay, a great history lesson and decent effects...the story was way lacking. Pulp Fiction deserved all that year. Pulp Fiction is unique in its manner of story telling. It's not your typical Scene A to B format. It goes all over the place and doesn't go in order. It also lets you see things from other peoples perspectives while also knowing what other characters are doing in the background. Like in the beginning sequence as Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are talking you can hear a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. Travolta even walks past them. Tarantino really had a great idea for this movie and it turned out fantastic. If you haven't seen it go get Pulp Fiction...you will not be disappointed."

However, I will call this movie a truly enjoyable experience.  It is violent, bloody, and profane, but sometimes, I need an injection of that in my life.  Great performances abound, but it is Samuel L. Jackson's pre-Jedi Master performance as the spiritually inclined Jules that truly makes this film terrific to watch.  Also a treat are Ving Rhames and Harvey Kietel as the Wolf.  When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I wasn't impressed, but the second time, I realized what a good time I had watching it.  Highly recommended."
25 February 2008,Biglebowski1,1,2,10,Unlike Anything Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction has some of the best dialouge in movie history, and is infinitely quotable. Quentin Tarantino's unbelievable script along with his energetic and enthusiastic direction, makes every scene interesting. Also, I believe his script is the sole reason for the three acting nominations this film received at the Oscars. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta were very entertaining, but if they had given a performance of that quality in any other film, they would not have received nominations. On the other hand, Uma Thurman's nomination continues to boggle my mind, as she contributed absolutely nothing to the movie. I would have preferred Amanda Plummer in her role, for she clearly understands Tarantino's dialouge and can deliver it in a far superior manner than Uma Thurman did. I am confused as to why Quentin Tarantino continues to use her in his films, as there are many actresses who could easily perform her roles without being as irritating as she is. This is also my biggest problem with the Kill Bill franchise, every other actor and actress in both the films has fun with their roles and dialouge, while her attempts to keep up with them are futile. Overall, though, not even Uma Thurman's annoying performance can ruin Pulp Fiction, for it is truly a one-of-a-kind film, and while it is often imitated, it will never be duplicated."

                        ",Typical Tarantino,"An excellent twist of hip, funny stories, Pulp Fiction casts a lot of Tarantino's favourite actors-Samuel L Jackson(True Romance, Jackie Brown), Tim Roth(Resevoir Dogs), Harvey Keitel(From Dusk Till Dawn, Resevoir Dogs), Steve Buscemi(Desperado, Resevoir Dogs) and even Tarantino himself. John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames are also in on the action. This film is excellent in many ways. The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the acting is brilliant and the story is so clever. Basically, the whole story is based around a crime boss(Rhames) and his mysterious brief case. We start off the film with Mr Roth and his partner robbing a diner, and from that moment on, the audience can sit back and stare in amazement at the talent shown on screen. All the stars give a career best. There are superb confrontations between the actors-Mr Rhames and Mr Willis, Mr Jackson and Mr Roth, Mr Willis and Mr Travolta, Mr Travolta and Ms.Thurman, Mr Keitel and Mr Tarantino and Mr Jackson and Mr Travolta. It leaves the audience wondering who knows who and for what reason. Its the exact intelligence that made Jackie Brown so tremendous. Rating=5/5"
19 December 2009,maxawg,4,7,10,Quentin Tarantino is a master of his trade,"Tarantino's masterpiece, is as so many other movies, far more then the sum of its parts. Completely disjointed and unrelated stories that come together to form one whole that is a wonderfully told story. This movie would have fallen flat had it not been for the amazing cast and Tarantino's fantastic script. While some of the dialog is completely random its also what gives the movie its wonderful depth while still retaining its simple nature.The cast of characters are great and filled with personality, but what really makes them come to life is the amazing actors portraying each character. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson both deliver stellar performances and play perfectly off of each other. Bruce Willis plays his character to perfection in what I would consider possibly the best performance of his career. Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames both have very strong and great performances as well, but the first three are who really shine in this film.Pulp Fiction is also the landmark movie for non-linear story telling. What Tarantino tried in Reservoir Dogs he perfected in Pulp Fiction. Its probably the inspiration for most if not all of today's modern non-linear films. Among Tarantino's many great films this is by far his best. Pulp Fiction is a masterfully done and brilliantly simple movie that was is and will always be remember as one of the best films of all time."

Just the right amount of action, just the right amount of comedy. All the acting is perfect. It's hard to choose who turned in the best performance. But of course, the man who is most responsible for this movie being perfect is Quentin Tarantino. He wrote the best screenplay of the 90's, or maybe the best screenplay ever. This movie has the best dialogue out of any movie I have ever seen. It's hard not to quote such great lines. And the direction is just amazing. Not to say that Robert Zemeckis didn't do a good job for ""Forrest Gump"" (because he did a great job), but that Oscar really should have gone to Quentin Tarantino. As ""Pulp Fiction"" should have won the Oscar for Best Picture over ""Forrest Gump"". (I do agree with Tom Hanks winning Best Actor over John Travolta and Martin Landau winning Best Supporting Actor over Sam Jackson though.)To sum it up: ""Pulp Fiction"" is a true classic that more than deserves its high spot on the IMDb top 250, and its spot on the AFI 100 Years, 100 Movies list (it should have been higher up on that one though). Perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect script...this movie is absolutely perfect. See it now if you haven't."

5 January 2010,WizardsRule11,4,7,10,Left Turns Right Turns Where is Tarentino's Writing Going to Take us Next,"Quentin Tarentino may claim that Inglorious Bastards is his masterpiece but all of his fans know that no movie of his will ever come close to touching his window into a fast chaotic world called ""Pulp Fiction"". Chapter 1. Original Writing: Even though Tarentino has said that his films are throwbacks to many older Japanese films and spaghetti westerns, there is one original recurring part of his films that makes them incredible to watch even if the story sucks and thats the dialogue. His characters are so beloved by many of his fans because they're so interesting to listen too.Chapter 2 . The Way It Was Told: If you think about it Pulp Fiction is a simple story but the way that it was presented to its curios audience is why it's such a memorable movie. Even though Reservoir Dogs had the same story arch as pulp I don't believe that it was executed in to it's truest potential. Well Pulp Fiction Filled in the cracks with more character development in a shorter time period because of Tarentino's improving skills in fast and witty dialogue. The way that the characters are introduced and dismissed from us i feel is a type of miscellaneous presentation that I had never seen be done before.Chapter 3. Soundtrack And Acting: While watching this incredible experience for a seventh time the other night with the presence of my father who admitted before watching that he is not the biggest fan of Tarentino's taste in music . I on the other hand find that is soundtrack is amazing in every movie. I t influences music lovers and aids the style of the story. Many artists had their debut with this movie such being Neil Diamond.Another aid through the film is the acting in which is very believable and coooool!!!!!!!!!!!! Jackson,and Therman became someone and Travolta was saved at last with a good role. But whose performance really stuck out for me was Ving Rham's when he was down in the basement giving Bruce Willis the low down low. The same goes for Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogueing at the beginning and end of this fantastic film.Soooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall see this movie. Twice!!!!!!!! Actually see it three times, no four time, no, oh I don't know. Buy it, buy it and cherish it for all of time because it truly is a masterpiece."
20 February 2018,parameswaranrajendran,0,1,10,Something fresh,"When comes to director Quentin Tarantino film, we will definitely get to lengthy dialogue scenes, tracking shots, details in his characterizations, abusive words and strong violence action scenes. This movie is still his best till date. He introduced pop culture in Hollywood through this film. The screenplay is quite different because it ends at where the movie starts. It is in out of chronological orders. Tarantino and Avary received Best Original Screenplay Award from Oscar. This is the first ""indie"" film in USA surpassed 100 million dollars in box office."
30 May 2013,raphaklopper,0,0,10,The dialogs.....THE DIALOGS!,"A thriller? A black comedy? A romance? A film about the Mafia? A film with racial themes? After all, what kind of movie is ""Pulp Fiction""? The question still holds but thanks to the genius of Tarantino managed to mix different themes and make his masterpiece legendary. But after all, what it is ""Pulp Fiction""? As soon as the film begins when we are presented with a couple sitting in a roadside café starting to talk about ways to robber-it and then finally decide to rob the coffee after kissing up and exchanging compliments. We realize that we are not in a regular movie, because the movie is not just the story of this couple, we have several others that appear throughout the film, but all connected. The ""supost main character"" Vincent (John Travolta) appears in three different stories, in one of them he is the ""bodyguard"" of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the wife of his boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and begins to feel attracted to her; in another story he is with his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to Marcellus Wallace; in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) a fighter who works Marcellus Wallace which after a fight (which was supposed to lose) he tries to flee the country with his French girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros).Many other characters form the movie mixing in stories, each one with a different theme, but all have something alike, long dialogs. The film features unprecedented writing, addresses several topics, some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters, but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is Quentin Tarantino. Despite having had help from Roger Avary on the screenplay this time, but all the ideas are still from Tarantino's mind, keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence.The film with so many stories, Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order. Not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters.A legendary film, excellent performances, perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining. Undoubtedly the best Tarantino film, a classic and a legendary masterpiece."
16 July 2007,g-s-mail,17,46,1,"Pulp Fiction is a film, which would better never produced.","Pulp Fiction is one of the films, they animated the students for the school-mass-acer in USA and all the other countries. Making a joke and kill men just in time, that is modern massacer. What a joke, only not for the victims. ""Awful"" and so called in German ""Brechmittel"", that is the real classification. Who want to see such a stupid story, American people, who vote with an average of 8,2. I can't understand. Are there so many cinema-fans with boodles of beer in there hands or lines with cocaine and problems in there brains. I don't know and I wonder me that there are ten lines necessary to vote for an awful film. Oh, I see, there must be ten lines and one line I have to write and with this line I reech it."
10 March 2010,pullupsrule,4,7,10,Addictive,"Entertaining beyond belief. If I were to direct a movie, I would choose Samuel L. Jackson hands down. He makes his movie gold. Combine his talent with Quentin Tarantino, and you've got double-gold. This movie deserves the number one spot on this site. Not only is it funny, it is clever, it has action, it has it all! A unique piece of work, it will have you scratching your head, & begging for more! It won so many awards & deserved to win best Director Oscar, but was beaten by Forrest Gump. Such a shame. That movie isn't in the #5 spot on this site. So undeserving. My review will not contain a spoiler as I have too much respect for this movie. I can't wait for the Grand Theft Auto movie to come out. Samuel L. Jackson will star in it for sure. It will be the best movie of all time, but until then I guess we'll all have to settle for Pulp Fiction. I've seen this movie over 100 times, and I never tire of it. There are many unique film-making traits the director has, such as non-linear story telling (probably something he invented), clever dialogue - all created from his own mind, specifically for this movie. Not written for a book or interpreted by someone else, it was his work exclusively & he deserves all the credit. A true genius. I can't wait to see what he thinks up next. I will be waiting in line. I hope he makes a movie to even rival his own work. I believe it can be done. Hopefully within the next couple of years. I wonder what he's up to right now, probably chilling with his piles of cash on top of a large pile of cocaine & naked ladies surrounding him. Damn that sounds good. He's my hero. A true man of men."

9 May 2017,kdibiase64,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction: A Brilliantly Stylish Film,"There is nothing out there quite like Pulp Fiction. This masterpiece directed by Quentin Tarantino manages to tell a story filled with quirks but held together by a slick sense of style. Tarantino's masterful directorial work is on full display here, with very iconic shots and fantastic pacing, helped by the movie's unique structure. The movie bounces back and forth between different stories and times out of chronological order, but the genius is that this lets Tarantino put the sequences in an order that makes more sense from an emotional level. Music is also used to great effect, typically in conjunction with editing to let the two really highlight each other. John Travolta does a good job as Vincent Vega, but the standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson's Jules, who steals every scene he's in and is extremely fun to watch. Finally everything is brought together by a fantastic script, filled with strange asides and rambling monologues that are as unnecessary as they are fantastic. A film to be remembered."
12 May 2005,GavAnderson,1,3,10,Masterpiece!!,"When this first hit the scene in 1994 it secured Quentin Tarantino a place in cinema history.

Superb performances throughout bring to life the already outstanding script to achieve near perfection. Tarantino's direction is perfect, and the script is one of the best to ever grace the cinema.It's a beauty of a film, one that took the conventions of film-making and spat on them to create an entirely new experience that you will never forget.

27 July 2008,commandercool88,0,1,10,Post-modern film-making at its best,"Without a doubt, 'Pulp Fiction' is one of the best pieces of postmodern film-making we have at our disposal. It is an audaciously entertaining hunk of pop culture, a feisty showing from Quentin Tarantino and one of his most raving successes. It's gloriously profane, unapologetically gratuitous, but not without purpose or meaning. With its underlying theme of redemption that runs through the veins of each story Tarantino tackles, 'Pulp Fiction' becomes an exhilarating and daring masterpiece.With a brilliant twist on the traditional three act set-up, Tarantino rolls expectations on their side and masterfully spins a web of many threads and intersects. Jam packed with adrenaline and unexpected twists and turns around every corner, 'Pulp Fiction' never panders to its audience and never passes up a wicked change-up thrown directly at the audience. We quickly pick up on the fact that this is not just violence for the sake of violence or vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity but a man wrestling with the very meaning of life. And what an extraordinary film it has made for, executed perfectly down to the very last detail.Each episode that Tarantino captures on film is simultaneously self-contained and apart of a whole. The sum of its parts is great, and whether it's Samuel L. Jackson's fury reigning down on the evil tyranny, or Uma Thurman sipping seductively on a five dollar shake, or Bruce Willis dismantling a hotel room in search for a wristwatch, 'Pulp Fiction' is never, ever dull. It carries a hefty running time (more than two-and-a-half hours), but we're constantly kept on our toes and immersed with the character Tarantino has zeroed in on. His writing here is fantastic, each line of dialogue delivered with calm confidence and each story developed with thrilling style.There's an abundance of fantastic performances to be admired within 'Pulp Fiction'. John Travolta's Vincent, Uma Thurman's Mia, Bruce Willis' Butch, Ving Rhames' Marsellus, Tim Roth's Ringo. But perhaps none more compelling and crackling than Samuel L. Jackson's Jules. His is the highlight of Tarantino's picture, a commanding role and fascinating character in search for redemption and a new outlook on life. When all is said and done, his story will still resonate most powerfully. It all goes back to Quentin Tarantino's immense ability to tell a story that not only keeps audiences entertained but has a purpose and destination. A great, great film that will leave an unforgettable impression you'll be itching to relive again.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
2 May 2018,joemjv,1,2,10,Wow,"The performance and top-notch acting along with Quentin Tarantino's professionalism makes this movie a true masterpiece. This movie revolves around more than one story - the stories are not in order but they are ordered in a way that keeps you amazed once you finish the movie. Although this movie is not classified as comedy, it will definitely make you laugh, which is quite surprising considering that it is a Crime/Drama.Summing up, great performances, great plot and amazing cast - a very well done work of art, would definitely recommend watching if you have not watched yet."

He is a brilliant director but even better writer! His dialogs is so rich and hilariously funny. Like Jules an Vincent's conversation of ""Le Big-Mac with cheese"". It's just too great. All the characters are made of little details. Amazing work! This Movie is almost only movie I can watch John Travolta without feeling awkward. It was a powerful comeback.""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the most copied movies in history. It has given birth many undying scenes, like the famous Jack Rabbit Slim's Twist Contest where Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (Travolta) twist a little... If you go to a masquerade you can be certain to find a couple of black suited males with big fuzzy afro's and oily, sleek hair.It was a shame Samuel L. Jackson didn't won the Oscar for his superb performance. I will never forget about ""Ezekiel 25:17""! It just too funny. It's black humor again and that's the way, aha aha, I like it, aha aha...Did you know that originally Jules was going to be bald? What a different film it would have been... At the masquerades people would have balds instead of afro's...""Pulp Fiction"" is the second best movie of the 90's. (The Shawshank Redemption is just one step ahead)"
3 November 1998,derekh,1,2,7,Well done...but was it worth doing?,"It's brilliantly written, superbly acted, and imaginatively directed. Having said that, I can't honestly say I liked this movie at all.  There's nothing wrong with a movie being disturbing or making you uncomfortable, but Pulp Fiction seems to do so without any real reason.  A movie is meant to either entertain or educate (or both).  Pulp Fiction is too over-the-top grotesque in parts for me to find it entertaining, and the gruesomeness does not redeem itself by being educational.  Well made, but not worth making in my opinion.  I give it a 7.  Strong quality of work, but not successful enough in its approach to rate higher."
28 April 2020,kalzayed,1,1,10,Perfect?,Most plot twisting movie you'll ever watch. All these meaningless scenes come to a twisting great climax that'll blow your mind. Iconic performance by the legendary (Samuel L. Jackson) and (John Travolta).
20 March 2013,thewillt08,0,1,10,Simply a Masterpiece,"A movie in which really has no main characters, a crazy plot, and insane dialogue. That is basically what sums up Pulp Fiction. Quentin Tarantino wasn't really known before Pulp Fiction, but after this movie he became one of the best directors in recent memory. I can't even tell you what the movie is about. Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all have their stories and they all somehow intertwine, that's really it. The plot makes no sense and the entire movie is confusing from the opening to ending credits. After the credits roll your mind starts piecing together and then you will realize that this movie is unique and brilliant.From the first scene of the movie I was hooked. The audience is introduced to Pulp Fiction in the middle of a conversation at a diner. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are talking and my attention was drawn to my TV. I intended on multitasking on the internet while watching but instantly I was drawn into their conversation. I recognized Tim Roth from Lie to Me and was curious what he was doing in this movie. The entire scene was just brilliant starting with a simple conversation and ending with a robbery of the diner. Then it was the next scene. I put the laptop down because I knew this movie deserved my full attention. Pulp Fiction is simply classic Tarantino. The original story, similar actors, creative dialogue, and an amazing score push the story along and make it what it is. Other than Travolta, there really is no ""main character"". I consider the script and the words the characters say as a character. If you break the movie down, very little actually happens. Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson have a solid 10-15 minute conversation about cheeseburgers and a foot massage. I don't know how they did it but they made a conversation about a foot massage very entertaining. A script like Pulp Fiction's does not come around lightly. This was one of the most interesting and captivating screenplays I have ever seen on film. There is not one boring scene in this movie because of the interesting conversations. This movie has a very long list of big actors, my favorite being Christopher Walken. He is only in the movie for one scene, but it is my favorite scene. Young Butch is watching TV and incomes Walken playing his father's POW friend. His father fought and died in the war and Walken had something to give him. Walken goes on a speech about a gold watch his father and himself hid from the Vietnamese. The delivery and presentation in this scene is hysterical. The camera never moves, all we see is Walken holding the watch and telling his story. It is a scene like this where you feel the words and their impact. I will say it all throughout this review; the words are what make this movie. As far as plot, there really is none. There are stories of individuals whose lives intertwine. What makes this movie special is that the scenes are out of order. I loved that it had this effect. The movie starts in the diner and then we never see them again, until the end. It's brilliant. After the movie I took a piece of paper and drew out the Pulp Fiction timeline. If a movie makes you think then it does its job, but this went above and beyond. I wanted to re-watch the movie in the correct sequence, but honestly, if I did, the movie is awful. If this movie was in the order of events it would be pointless and meaningless. It would be a ridiculous movie with weird dialogue. Instead, the audience is left wondering what is going on and we get sucked into the universe that is, Quentin Tarantino. Do I like that the movie is out of order? Well, yes and no. My really only problem is that all of the actors are seen once and most of them are never seen again. In the first opening scenes Samuel L. Jackson was so entertaining but then he left and we don t see him again for a very long time. The movie skips ahead to Travolta and Uma Thurman's night on the town. I missed seeing Samuel L. Jackson on screen. Then we get sucked into Bruce Willis' story and I missed Travolta and Uma Thurman, but I was so interested with Bruce Willis, I didn't even care. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I loved these characters and wanted to see all of them at once, which I realize isn't possible. I wanted them to have more interaction with each other, but then again, that would have probably made the movie a lot worse. Another problem with the scene jumping is the irrelevance of events. Once scene one character gets blown away and killed by another. At that time it was a huge deal because one of the characters died, but in the next sequence he was alive again walking around being awesome. It took away from his death and almost made it pointless. If you pay attention towards the end we see why he dies but it almost seemed unnecessary and random that he died. Tarantino made this movie not intending to make a sequel, but he never reveals what is in the briefcase that Jules carries around. Why not? What is in it? I want to know. Overall, Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece of writing. The screenplay and how the actors acted out the words on the page is what made this movie a classic. I didn't want to see this movie because people said it deserved Best Picture over Forrest Gump in 1994. I didn't want to believe there was a better movie then that, but I liked this movie more. I think Forrest Gump deserved the Oscar but Pulp Fiction still gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."
29 December 2003,Sfpsycho415,0,1,9,One of my favorite movies---9/10,"Three stories are intertwined into one in the Quentin Tarantino masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Tarantino is master of dialogue and one of the best things about this movie is the conversations between the characters. They are like a plot all by themselves. You have no idea what's going to said next. Sometimes it shocking and it's very often funny. The all-star cast consisting of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman deliver their instantly classic lines with perfection. Pulp Fiction also has exciting scenes and a great story. Travolta and Jackson play two hit men working for a crime lord (Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run and Thurman plays Rhames' wife. Violence, betrayal, drugs, and comedy ensue in movie that's plot on paper doesn't sound like much, but with a great cast and an excellent filmmaker in Tarantino, it is easily one of the best movies of all time. 9/10"

16 August 1999,Chuck-149,0,0,9,"Clever, tough, funny, brilliant. A gem.","This is a great movie.  Quentin Tarantino who decided to break down his movie into four little stories did a great job at it.  Plus, he added everything in it that was necessary without overdoing anything.  Sure some of the scenes are rough but there isn't a scene in the movie where you can say ""Well that's a little too much"" unless you hate violence.  But what is great about this movie as well is that Tarantino somewhat copied Hitchcock (Be forewarned, I'm giving away some scenes in the movie so if you haven't seen it, skip this part, read the last paragraph and read this after you've seen it.  However, if you don't mind having a few scenes spoiled before seeing the movie, go ahead, be my guest and read this).When Travolta stabs Uma Thurman with the needle, Tarantino did like Hitchcock used to do: He makes you think it's going to be very gory and sick but there isn't a drop of blood.When Ving Rhames crosses the street, stares at Bruce Willis, curses at him and then gets run over by Bruce Willis, Tarantino copied a little the scene in ""Psycho"" when Janet Leigh's boss crosses the street and sees her in her car when he thinks she's home resting.  So, this said, the movie is really great.  Personally, I felt that Travolta should have won the Oscar for best actor that year instead of Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"".  It's an excellent crime movie."
11 May 2000,terminator33,1,2,10,One of the best and most influential movies of the 90's,"To be honest ""Pulp Fiction"" was the most influential movie of the 1990's.

Of all the films that copied this movie none of them even came close to equaling this movie. This is a movie not to be missed."

Then, after watching the movie for the first time; it became one of my all-time favourite films. I think my favourite segment was probably The Gold Watch, in which a boxer (Bruce Willis) discovers his fate because of the watch given to him by his father (Christopher Walken) what happens in that segment is so shocking, which includes a torture scene and a twist at the ending. Anyway, I loved this film and wish to watch it again and again. Added with Black Comedy and even a small appearance by Tarrintino himself, the movie is well-written and directing despite of what some may believe. 10/10!"
6 August 2006,fuzzysham13,1,2,10,A movie jumbled in order but in perfect sequence,"Tarantino is the best. No one can touch his style of mixing the story line up. This is my all time favorite movie. I once heard someone say there was so much violence in the movie and so many deaths. I countered and said ""There's less than ten deaths."" You only see about seven people die and it's not gun to the head, it's like when Bruce Willis cuts the guy with the sword it's with the other's guys back to us so we don't see a whole lot, just a red line across his stomach after wards.I like what Samuel L. said about the movie. ""It's not about death, but rather redemption."" I personally think this movie is semi-religious. Well it has a lot of religious symbolism, even though there is no allegory like John Travolta, for example, is God. It's not like that. There are three main stories, seven deaths, and everyone is given a second chance to change their life."
30 October 2019,chiaragiacobelli,0,1,8,Probably the best Tarantino's movie,"Everybody knows ""Pulp fiction"", so another review seems useless. I can only say that this is probably the best movie signed by Tarantino, a real cult who influenced entire generations.
Some scenes, like the dance between Uma Thurman and John Travolta, are just epic. Amazing and brilliant."
20 March 1999,Stealth-5,0,0,8,Very Intelligent Piece Of Work...,"Ok....Well not SO intelligent with all the unneccesary swearing and violence, but it was a great film divided into very exciting segments, which left you wondering what would happen next. Although some of the segments were led to the wrong direction which also make me think that the movie didn't make sense, but you WILL get it. The best part has to be,when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get those druggo's in their appartment. Uma Thurman was great in this film very fresh and alive, well not really alive after that encounter with the ""needle"". The film was very bloody and had a lot of swearing, but you didn't really focus on that when watching the film - it was that exciting. Well overall here are my ratings...Acting- 4 / 5 Actors- 4 / 5 Script- 3 / 5 Display-4 / 5 Plot-   4 / 5 Performance - 3.5 / 5 Overall - 4 / 5B+"

21 December 2006,RipRap,1,5,10,Should be #1,"not #8 as it currently is. This is one of the all time best scripts ever put to celluloid in a long time, and I am sure someday it will eclipse the current first place holder. The only reason the godfather is voted #1 is because of the multi-millions of dollars that they spent on that movie. There should be a rating system where you can figure in the cost of production into the ratings. Pulp Fiction would truly be #1 in BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK on any list! I cannot believe how many of today's young people have never even heard of this film. Ask a twenty something who directed Pulp Fiction and I bet they come back with Pulp What? It is a shame that today's youngster are being fed all kinds of garbage from the Hollywood film factories that are nothing but badly made remakes of films that should never have been made in the first place. I really hate it when they do remakes, and then never even mention that it is a remake. This should be illegal. By not giving credit to the original, is that not a form of copyright infringement? If you have never seen Pulp Fiction, you owe it to yourself to see it IMMEDIATELY!"

26 July 2019,SmileyMcGrouchpantsJr,0,4,2,"Not bad, a little walk through these neighborhoods ...","... true, it's great to see TV characters spilled out into real life (both John Travolta, as Vinnie Babarino, and Bruce Willis, as what's-his-name on ""Moonlighting,"" got their start on TV), roaming around and running into each other ... *crash!*True, it's great to see Generation X learning to order meals for itself. In diners. Hang out, haggle the particulars and all. Bring the Boomers with them, who mostly didn't have time to stoop to learn from us crows (""All you kids do is shop and complain."" -- Douglas Coupland, ""Generation X"").True, it's nice to see a slower-paced American movie -- more leisurely than frantic, by screamingly far, compared to most fare, circa 1994 or not.Sadly (and I'm including, here, the novelty of seeing it on network TV -- the racial slur is replaced with ""brother,"" which loses nothing, except for the whole speech after ""I know about the coffee in my kitchen,"" sorry Quentin), but it doesn't seem worth it for all of American culture to slow down as though Quentin had thought of it first.Not ""After Dark, My Sweet,"" or ""The Grifters"" (or ""The Killing"" or ""Paths of Glory,"" two screenplays Jim Thompson worked on). Not ""Wild at Heart"" (which people saw) or ""Miller's Crossing"" (which most people didn't). Or Nick Gomez's ""Laws of Gravity"" (even less). Or Jim Jarmusch films, Nick Cave songs & their imagery, Wim Wenders road movies, etc.Instead, we got ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,"" ""Year of the Gun,"" and even more forgettable films green-lit in the wake of this ""formula"" which no-one was successful in repeating, and seems only like a lark now.""Lost Highway"" will take you into the mind. This? A jaunt around the block, the best TV show you ever saw, 'cause it rips off movies. Boo-hoo for Quentin. Time to party! Leave us with the shattered remains, and years to pick it up, like a child's playroom with toys scattered everywhere ...

4 May 2019,spahs2019,2,8,2,I can't stand Tarantino movies,"Every single Tarantino movie I have ever watched is edgy and annoying to me. Like a rebelling teenager trying to prove how different he is to everyone else. There is rarely any consistent storyline, just over the top, yet nonchalant violence, screaming ""Look how cool I am, now give me an Oscar!"" All his movies feel like they are made with only two intentions, to become a cult-classic and, more importantly, to give praise to its genius director, Quentin Tarantino."
23 April 2006,blueglenn201,6,10,7,filled with star making performances,"despite my initial dislike of this movie, i have changed my opinion regarding 'pulp fiction' for a very particular reason. two people, john travolta and uma thurman, better be kissing q. Tarantino's bootie in appreciation for what he was done for their careers. obviously uma thurman is worthy of her role as muse, but the work she did in this movie was so strong it made it impossible for people to dismiss her as just another ridiculously beautiful face. john travolta had all but resorted to used car lot opening's when his role in this movie thrust him back in the spotlight. OK, i'm not as thrilled about this, but still, we got uma."
30 December 2002,PrivateBryant,1,2,10,"Shamelessly explicit, but genius","The fact that this is one of the most acclaimed movies by both critics and audiences alike, worldwide, is no coincidence. The content of this film is shocking- one man's vision of the many different aspects of petty criminals lives in Los Angeles. Quentin Tarantino doesnt pull his punches and in both this and Reservoir Dogs, he portrays a very realistic view of gritty world, not worrying about excessive amounts of bad language, some graphic violent scenes, and even drug use. The magic of Tarantino is that he manages to couple this with a great, fast moving script, and a well thought out plot, that he executes perfectly. So not only do you feel that what you are watching is probably pretty close to reality, but it is irrestibly entertaining aswell. Pulp Fiction is really one story, following Vincent Vega(John Travolta)and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson), as they have a hectic couple of days at the office, working for crimelord Marsellus Wallace. But it is told in three shorter sections that,combined together, tell the tale. The good thing is that you have to follow quite closely to get the best out of the movie, and afterwards take a couple of seconds to sort the scenes you have seen into the correct order that they happened. It's not really hard or complicated, but makes the film more interesting than if it were a beginning-middle-end story. The way that Tarantino executes this, both in the script and the actual film itself, is deserving of all the accolades he recieved. Of course, the thing that carries the film, along with the script, is the fantastic acting by one of the best casts I have ever seen. Backing up Travolta and Jackson are: Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Kietel, Bruce Willis,Uma Thurman,Eric Stoltz,Tarantino Himself,Amanda Plummer, and fans of Reservoir Dogs, (like me), will be pleased to see Steve Buscemi make a small appearance as a waiter dressed up as Buddy Holly. Everything about this film is enjoyable, unless you are easily offended, and it deserves a lot of credit."
21 March 2020,r-48240,0,0,10,Classic,"The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop."
9 July 2006,parhat,0,3,8,"We Choose Our life but s**t happens then the ""miracle"" or ""luck""","Yes Yes Yes. The movie have a message. If some viewers don't think so! People who watched this movie thinks the movie doesn't have a message. Well, in my locale, everybody seems to agree that it does have a message, but we tend to take things for granted.The life of crime that the two hit-man had a job for two to send the mysterious briefcase (probably gold bars) to his boss. But on the way they encountered ""s**t happens"".Basically the one of the hit-man accidentally shot an informant and they had to get rid of the body. However before he was shot, one of the hit-man had a ""revelation"" of a ""miracle"" and interpreted that this miracle was his decision to quit his job as well as making the ""right"" decision in the cafe robbery as well! However lack of sense that is beyond the ""realms of explanation"", Jules made a decision not to further his career and his one last job is simply to successfully send the briefcase to his boss.The other hit-man refused to believed it and went to continue his job. That decision was to cost him his life, which was shot by a boxer who decided not take a fall.Perhaps there is a miracle or luck, but we just ignore the ""signals"". Is that true? The boxer, accidentally forget his father's watch, being so superstitious along with his nightmares and flashbacks, his so called ""lucky watch"" he had to go back to his apartment to retrieved it. His intuition proved to be a correct one.He knew very well that by going back that he risked his life of being shot by a hit-man who is probably going to kill him in the apartment. But the fact that he did retrieved the lucky watch, he got ""lucky"", really lucky. Not only did he survived it, but without spoiling the movie, everything simply turned topsy turvy from bad luck, to good luck and a major reversal of fortune. Something that most logicians would describe as ""impossible"".So basically if anyone would ask, hey guy what's Pulp Fiction movie about? I would simply say, things (s**t) happen, your belief in something can really carry you through inspite of every logical things that could possibly happen. Things will not go as you expect. You will have both good luck and then bad luck. How you understand an event, whether it makes sense or not, will be a correct one, provided that you don't ignore its signals. Sometimes not only God works in mysterious ways, but our own Unconscious works in mysterious ways. Things don't have to make sense as long as it works. I learned that the hard way. Thousands of years ago we can't explain why the water rise with the full moon, but we can always predict it. Today we know why, but that doesn't mean we can predict any much more better than the ancients. You don't have to explain to make anything work, it just had to work.Or in short, Superstitions will happen and it can help you! We leave the explanation later, get results, why can be explained later. Why will not save your life. Results will, regardless of the explanation.Overall a very good movie with a subtle message, which makes this movie my favorite one. Subtle message are powerful, but once the veil of mystery is lifted, all the excitement just goes away. This movie makes this veil difficult to lift and it makes for a classic movie, of the likes of Casablanca, if only they just eliminate the use of vulgar words!"
24 November 2009,Joe_Chip_627,1,2,10,Best film of the 90s,"Following several interlocked tales of criminals, ""Pulp Fiction"" is about as well-written, well-acted, and well-directed as any film out there. The first storyline centers around Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta), who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). The second story line focuses on Vincent taking Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) to dinner, and the final storyline is about Wallace bribing a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) to take the fall is a boxing match. Of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order, but going through everything that happens would take a while. Tarantino won a Best Screenplay Oscar, but the movie should have won many more awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), and Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman). In most years, I would say that John Travolta should have won the Best Actor Oscar, but I give the nod to Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"". The acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere. Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvy Keitel and Eric Stoltz are all terrific. The only sub par performance is that of Tarantino himself. The style of direction that Tarantino uses is one of those ""love it or hate it"" kinds. If you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character, then you will like Tarantino's style of direction. In conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is the best movie made in the 90's. I was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time, but after sitting through it, there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out. This is a film that once you see, you will want to watch over and over again. That is the true sign of a masterpiece."
12 October 2004,gr8one232,1,2,10,Masterful,"This movie has forever changed the face of film-making. Never had a movie with so many seedy, unlikable characters gained such wide praise, without having any glamorous drama or action. The movie is about as real as it gets. I have read many criticisms outlining the lack of meaning in the dialogue. To me thats the genius of it. This is everyday s**t that any two people in a car or restaurant are discussing. How many people sit in a diner or any other business talking about what it would be like to rob the place? How many guys talk about foot massages? Mia Wallace is top of the line on meaningless conversation, especially in her deleted scenes with Vincent getting his interview.The movie winds together beautifully, and I love the fact that most of the morons I know dismiss it merely on its lack of continuity. It rightfully deserves its praise. If you judge it on nothing else, judge it on its entertainment value. I can watch this film 50 times in 50 days, its that much fun"
31 January 2005,kenneththaarup,1,2,9,The best film by Quentin Tarantino. Really a masterpiece!,"Pulp fiction is a story about the two gangsters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). At the same time it is about the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). The two separate stories get mixed up with a couple of other stories, and some people might find this confusing, but it isn't - it's brilliant! The story jumps in time, and that is why a dead guy can be alive in the next scene. The movie is driven by extremely well written dialogues, and the acting is really great performed.Either you love this movie or you hate it. Most people love it. If you hate it, see it again! I give it 8/10"
25 June 2001,Mario64,0,1,10,A great original flick,"Pulp Fiction is trully one of the best movies of the 90's. It's wondarfully made and entertaining from begining to end. It's not a standardly played movie, instead it's not in sequence and comes together at the end. It's trully ogininal. The performances are also great, my favorite being John Travolta's. If you haven't seen this movie see it at once, it will be a classic."
3 October 2000,eye3,0,1,10,"Devils and Angels, Damnation and Redemption","The rock 'n' roll packaging is a spoonful of sugar for this movie's theme: ""damnation or redemption?""Every character is either redeemed from their sins or damned for them; they're either angels or devils, or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out.But who would care if PF hadn't been so well written, directed, produced or even acted in the first place?"

                        ",Answering some questions...,"First off, as I read sometime ago, Tarantino with ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn ´t try to introduce and/or play with a plot, instead he introduces you to a world.  His world.  A world where the so-called ""anti-socials"" are far more complicated than the ""normal people"" (as I´m writting this, and I use the term ""normal people"" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti socials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make the characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what they´re doing with them.  As Jules says, he´s trying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical purposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once again, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.  One thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  It´s an extasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.     Finally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch."
19 April 2022,hakra1,0,1,10,ATF,"One of my all time favourites, absolute cineastic masterpiece and one of those movies that you watch various times and still find many fantastic details to enjoy!Camera, music, dialogues great as always in QT works and travolta offers the performance of his career!"
1 February 2022,ashleyfitches,0,0,8,A crazy and unique movie.,"I came into this movie already knowing on how iconic and with social media a lot of clips and references have been made on the internet, but hadn't watched it until my first time right now. I found this movie a creative and unique movie to say the least, with a comedy edge to it whilst also bringing in the drama and thriller mixing the genres, you was smiling and laughing in one scene the next in shock and scarred in some sense especially with one scene. This movie also had the feeling you was following stories of individuals all in one. So to end this spoiler review I would recommend this to anyone who is interesting in of the genres I said above, but to also have a strong stomach and be prepared for a long ride."
25 April 2004,dave-800,1,2,9,A Class Of Its Own,"I saw this film expecting a very original well written masterpiece and I was not let down in the slightest. Pulp Fiction must rank as one of the wittiest funniest and truly enjoyable films I have ever seen. And to top it all, the film boasts a star studded list of fine actors who all seem to give their utmost in performing their roles.There were two things that made the film as good as it was: the dialogues (which of course is what Tarantino is famous for) and the humour. What I liked most, however, was the humour. The `Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?' sequence certainly cracked me up. For me, though, there could and should have been even more of such humorous episodes."
16 July 2000,Castor-30,1,2,10,One of my all time favorites,"Although I am a big fan of this movie, I can understand why some  people don't like this movie.  It is violent, and has a lot of cussing.  But to me, this is just a great dark comedy.  In most parts  it is funny, and at other times it is just immensely entertaining.  The acting is great, and the writing is just wonderful.  I can never get enough of the Tarantino dialogue.  This movie is just great, It is definitely one of my favorites. Pulp Fiction gets an easy 10/10 from me."
25 October 2017,johnny-burgundy,0,1,9,"This is a classic, when it comes to modern crime cinema.","Pulp Fiction (1994) This is a dark comedy and crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It recounts the stories of criminal Los Angeles, in which the plot follows the robbers; gangsters; saving a girl from a drug overdose and boxer, who was deceived. This is a shout out to crime novels, known for their violence and dialog. It was a major critical and commercial success. The list of Hollywood royalty involved with this film is too long to list. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman, each received Oscar nominations for their roles, which had a positive impact on their careers. It was chosen for preservation by the Library of Congress. This is one of my favorite Tarantino films. I'm partial to True Romance, be he only wrote that one. If you've never seen a Tarantino film, this would be a great start. This is a classic, when it comes to modern crime cinema."
23 July 2002,kreidler,1,3,6,Disturbing,"There are some hilarious scenes and excellent performances in this movie. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta are awesome and MAKE this film worth seeing.  But be warned the gratuitous violence in the film is very disturbing...lots of violence, sexual violations, drugs, language and more violence but it all seems like the movie is just trying to hard.
Rating: 6 out of 10."
16 July 2001,Mike Astill,0,1,10,"Remains my favourite film, one that somehow continues to get better with every viewing.","I watched this yet again at the weekend, and it remains my favourite film, one that somehow continues to get better with every viewing. Tarantino's witty and lurid script is delivered spot-on by actors that seem to have been born to play their parts, most impressive being Samuel L. Jackson's bible-quoting hitman and Bruce Willis' honourable boxer. Willis usually ups the ante when he's in good company, and in this film the company doesn't get much better. Each character has their own classic scene, even the cameos (Christopher Walken's in particular), and each scene seems better than the last. Even when you know what's coming, you're looking forward to it with relish.Add a superb soundtrack that compliments the film's retro feel, and there's not much negative to say. Even the beefy running time doesn't detract from the fun. It's not a movie you'll be wanting to watch with your mother, as the tongue-in-cheek comedy is as black as it could possibly be, but it's brash, enthusiastic film-making that can't be ignored, or - up to now at least - bettered."
2 April 2019,xmdbx,0,0,9,A Masterpiece,"This is one of the few movies that I have to watch almost every time it's on. It's just so good. Everything about it is great. It's completely absurdist but it's authentic to that absurdity. Every second contributes to the building of the world in a way that comes off as the opposite of contrived. It doesn't focus on any single character but instead focuses on the story itself. That's not to say that the film doesn't contain some of the best characters that there has ever been on screen. The characters are portrayed in such a way that the story is seen as a natural product of their beings. The movie is technically amazing. It is able to so easily master long drawn-out single camera takes as well multi-camera quick cuts. Everything is perfectly timed and everything has a purpose. Pulp Fiction is seen as Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece and it is for very good reason, it's one of the best films of all time."
17 June 2003,jmm509,1,3,9,Perfect!,"The plot of a boxer, two hit men, and two robbers collide together to make the movie spectacular.  This is one of Quentin Tarantino's best films. One of the top ten movies of the 90's.  It creates a plot unthinkable by any other human.  The movie is just depicted as a classic."
6 April 1999,ToldYaSo,0,0,10,"Some films should be seen in a theater, this is one of them.","If this film isn't making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private, candid conversation, then it's knocking you on your butt, flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic. Unless of course, you're my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching. I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking I'd just seen something amazing and that I'd never seen anything like it before.I still remember the riveting, tense feeling I had when Butch, played by Bruce Willis decides to go back for his father's gold watch at his apartment, certain that gangsters like John Travolta's Vincent Vega are looking for him. The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense, as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death. And then the moment he thinks everything is fine, he decides to toast a pop tart. I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. And later still, when you think everything is fine again, you're floored by another predicament.The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion, is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater. Naturally, the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension, unless of course you suffer from amnesia and don't remember what happens. But what I'm getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video.For me, Pulp Fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment."

How many else have the guts to rewrite the bible.. ""Do you read the bible, Brent..?"". I'm quite sure, I'll never see a better movie than this. The characters are well developed (and cool), the script is the best collection of words there could ever be and the cinematography, the music, THE MUSIC, the acting and the direction are all high standard (and cool). There's literally nothing in this film, that I wouldn't like. Especially Samuel L. Jackson deserves an applause. Nobody else in the history of humankind has made the word ""f**k"" sound so awesome and cool. I only wish that I could have half of the intelligence, that this film displays. Thank you, mr. Tarantino. Keep making them, I'll keep watching them!***** / *****"

This movie was thought out to the very smallest detail by director Quentin Tarantino, which is why a first time viewer may seem lost.

It's not like in all the other movies where 1 or 2 heroes of the regular movie kill numerous quantity of people and then ""Save de Girl!"" And that's a very good start if you ask me! They kill for reason! They kill because they know this is the right thing to do! They kill because they haven't got another choice!2) Story An interesting story of 1-11 heroes is shown in this movie! If you saw this movie right amount of time you would say that almost every person shown in this movie has his own story.3) Chapters Movie is separated into chapters! Not only that but it's also distributed chaotically, so you have to decide from where it all starts and where it ends! Offcourse this movie has many endings: For some people unfortunate and some people fortunate endings!4) Conversations Conversations is the capital letter in this movie. People say that characters talk too much, but they don't say that they talk about nothing, because they don't and that is the exact point!5) Cast All the actors did quite surprisingly well in this movie! I would say that they've done their best, сertainly not for the money but for us to enjoy and so we did, do and will be!The Bottom Line is ""If you have spare cash and you have spare time go buy this movie and enjoy it as much as you can!"""

20 July 2009,matus92,1,2,10,Royale with Cheese,"What can I say about this film? It's genius. It's innovative. It's entertaining. It's just about everything I look for in a movie. Pulp Fiction is like no other movie before it. Actually, correction, it's like several movies before it- Pulp Fiction pays homage to so many styles of art, it creates its own style. The great thing about Pulp Fiction is the lack of overlying story; it's almost as if the characters, style and dialogue is the story.First of all, the dialogue- you will not find more realistic dialogue in a movie than Pulp Fiction. The entertaining musings of hit men discussing hamburgers and foot massages will not only keep you interested, but will also reveal the characters the film is based on. The directing is strong- we see our fair share of Tarantino trademarks: the trunk shot, the long take etc. The acting is incredible as well, the cast being one of the best ever assembled including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis and Eric Stoltz.What really sets Pulp Fiction apart, however, is the style of storytelling. The most obvious technique used is non-linear time-line of the film. Tarantino picks and chooses which events we are to see and when. The effect of this style is fantastic and the movie ends on a thematically relevant and somewhat ironic moral point. Pulp Fiction is most likely the best film of its decade and a must-see for every film-lover.10/10"

10 February 2004,canadude,0,1,10,"really, one of a kind","Rarely does a movie come out that has such a powerful impact on movies that come after it. Pulp Fiction, aside from being a great movie, revolutionized filmmaking, and energized it, while making a strong stamp on current pop culture. Its impact can be compared to film's magicians of the 70s like Coppola, Polanski, or Scrosese for example. It is a work of stunning originality (which is still easy to appreciate, regardless of countless imitations out there); three intersecting stories carried by dialogue. Now, a lot has been made of the screenplay and the conversations in the film, and for a good reason - the film consists of poetry spoken in gangster lingo, with beautifully embellished, anecdotic logic, exuberant vulgarity, pop culture allusions (of the best kind) and finally spiritual contemplation and irony. The dialogues are fresh and have seeped into pop culture. The movie is at once an artistic tribute to pulpy gangster films with strong European influences, and an original of its own. It is a story of redemption in a world that is so carefully crafted it can only be admired. The performances, from Jackson and Travolta, to Willis and Thurman are flawless. And the carefully carefree dosages of savage brutality and drugs add to the exuberance of this movie, along with its soundtrack. Pulp Fiction is really one of a kind - and I doubt Tarantino will ever top himself (though I hope he does - Kill Bill isn't close enough). Instead, many have focused on attempting to do original films within the Pulp Fiction genre, one marked by non-chronological storytelling, jovial dialogue and so on. However, this generally results in a contradiction in terms - it's hard to do an original film in the style of a film whose remarkableness is due to its original style. Surely, someone will experiment with form again to a revolutionary degree, but Pulp Fiction remains one of a kind, and one of my very favorites."
7 May 1999,hedgehog-10,0,0,10,"Excellent film, shame about Quentin's acting.",The film is very well directed and scripted yet the film also shows that Quentin Tarantino is far better a director than an actor. Definitely an 10 out of 10 film but Quentin Tarantino should stick to the superb directing instead of the dreadful acting.
14 May 2013,tomer83,11,28,1,Too much violence,"I'm sorry but this is CRAP. This movies contains too much violence for nothing. The use of violence in movies is understandable but I'm not fond of this overdose, I do not appreciate it a all. Of course, this is a huge problem with movies, ESPECIALLY with the Hollywood movies. Violence in films effects society as not all people can draw the line. Tarantino do not spare extra crime in his movies, and Pulp Fiction is not an exception. The most ridiculous thing is that in a way the violent characters looks cool and fun, some of them get away with murder as if it's a part of a romantic-sweet-meaningful episode in their cool lives (as in Bruce Willis character). It's a shame this movie is on top of the pack with its score here. Wish u peace & love everyone."
14 March 2019,AntamMalakar,2,3,10,Best of John Travolta,Pulp Fiction is the movie which I can see again and again. This is the master pieces of the actor John Travolta. You can see his classic acting skill in this movie. I will suggest everyone to watch this master piece.
7 January 2014,donuthaters12,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction Is A Triumph In Contemporary Cinema,"Pulp Fiction is the film that put Tarantino on the map, and this film is regarded as many as his magnum opus. At first, I didn't agree to this acclaim and it did had me confused a bit due to it's lack of driving plot and seriousness that I expect from crime films. After subsequent viewings, I understood that I came into this with the wrong mindset and that I did not appreciate the boldness that Tarantino demonstrated with this film. Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade.The film is written by Quentin Tarantino and his screenplay here is like a collection of his best stories sewed together. The highlight of this film is his use of pop culture, hilarious, and naturalistic dialogue. In Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's dialogue in that film did contain that style that is found here but it does from time to time fall unto the conventional dialogue that is found many crime films but in Pulp Fiction, the lack of plot allows him to focus on it's characters and therefore write dialogue that is not boxed in by the story. Though the film is not tied down by it's story, it does include it to have a conclusion of sorts in the end of each segment. The characters in the film are one of the main reasons that this film is enjoyable because they are all so unique and different from one another and they never feel like they are common archetypes, and one of the main reasons are the delivery of the actors and the smart quirky dialogue from Tarantino.Quentin Tarantino's sophomore film is a major improvement over his previous film, in terms of style, dialogue, and photography. Tarantino was able to maintain the tone of dark humor, and the grit of a crime/gangster film. Without the humor, I think may be suffered by characters just having a regular conversation just before a very brief burst of action. One of the main points that made this film appealing is the jumbling of the storyline, and having each storyline having some sort of throwback to the other. Pulp Fiction is an execution of style but not sacrificing an inch of substance.Andrzej Sekula comes back to handle the photography of this film, and it is an improvement over the previous film that felt rushed and amateurish. Sekula and Tarantino have taken the things that worked on Reservoir Dogs and improved upon it here. Pulp Fiction contains multiple shots that felt precisely placed and takes away the hand held style that was found on the previous film, except for heated moments in the film. The film contains long takes of the actors just spitting out his dialogue and delaying the action of the film, which at times is not as fun as the moments that precedes it, and it also allows the camera to explore the environment these characters are confined in.Pulp Fiction lacks the musical score that most films succumb to and is primarily a soundtrack driven film, similar to the first film. The film contains excellent songs from multiple decades, and these tracks at most times defines the scene. These tracks are now much more abundant here in comparison to his previous film therefore the film doesn't feel quiet and rarely contains a moment that felt slow or didn't feel cinematic.Pulp Fiction contains a stellar cast with standouts that include Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis. When these actors come on screen, they bring their A game. The chemistry between John Travolta and Samuel Jackson or Uma Thurman is fun to watch and did allow me to get sucked in with their words and their relationship. These actors gave these parts with seriousness to a story that is ridiculous, that it allows the film to attain that dark humor that made this film so appealing. The actors I did not mention were not as much of a standout as the other actors but they do their part well enough that none of them felt boring or underwhelming.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece that contains hilarious dialogue, outrageous story lines, precise photography, stellar soundtrack, and great acting. The film is a milestone in cinema history and has been looked upon to in future films as inspiration. Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's best film and arguably, the best film of that decade."

                        ",A film to be remembered,"We've got a few stories that make up this film; a pair of diner bandits who attempt to rob a coffee shop, a boxer who gets on the wrong side of a crime boss, two gangsters who get into some bother after an errand, and a gangsters wife who seriously needs looking after.Sounds bizarre, but it turns out to be great! The different stories cleverly link together to make up a bigger story, and eventually everything makes sense. You've got John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson as the two henchmen of big crime boss Marcellus Wallace, who are ordered to retrieve a mysterious briefcase from a gang of layabouts, but end up in a 'messy' situation on the way back. Uma Thurman is good as Marcellus's pretty, but drugged up wife who likes to dance, the excellent Tim Roth is one of the bandits who is intent on retiring from crime after one last job. Then you've got Bruce Willis as the boxer, who spends more time looking for his watch more than anything else. Added to this you've got excellent supporting roles from Harvey Keitel as the man who solves problems, and Christopher Walken who hides things in strange places.All in all though, this film entertained me, and contains some rather bizarre scenes that you won't forget."
18 August 2015,yankeemvp,1,2,10,Best movie of all time,"Shows multiple different stories and how they interact with one another in an out of order sequence but boy does it work. The main story focuses on the Vincent Vega and Jueles two hit-man working for gangster Marsellus Wallace. Brilliance of this movie besides the way it's filmed and the acting is the dialogue. Shows to hit-man on the way to a job and what they talk about not just loading their guns like any other movie. Bruce Willis is another one of the main stories a boxer supposed to take a fall for Marsellus Wallace, things don't go according to plan and Bruce Willis is forced to go on the run. Unfortunately his girlfriend forgot the one thing that matters to him his father's watch which Christopher Walken explain explains in an unforgettable dialogue. One of the best scenes of the movie comes from director Quinten Tarantino as Jimmy. The third story which is the minor of the three is Vincent Vega taking Marsellus Wallace's wife out on a date. Uma Thurman as Mia. Although a short subplot also has one of the most unforgettable scenes involving a heroine overdose. There are so many great lines and every single actor gives a great performance. I have never seen such a perfect movie before. It is a shame that not only did this not win best picture but that there were no Oscar wins for acting. Although this movie may not be for everyone it is definitely a must see and by far the best movie of the 90s. So much more can be said but I will just ended on what does Marsellus Wallace look like?"

He makes it look like it is fantastic to have the joy of making a movie but it is also very very fun.As for the guts of the film, the acting is brilliant, the script genius and the way that it has been filmed is pure magic inspired only by Tarantino. The way the stories merge is amazing and the plot is fantastic.Please watch this movie whenever you get a chance and please enjoy it, as I said it did change cinema forever.I think it is the eighth best film on the IMDb rankings and I agree.

Quentin Tarantino's worst. i sat through this movie about 5 years ago thinking to myself, what the f is going on? i sat through it again tonight and I'm still saying what the f was the point of this movie? There's no beginning, no end, no actual plot and it's pretty boring. Don't get me wrong it wasn't completely awful - the dialogue was interesting enough and it had some funny moments and Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman were awesome but the movie had no purpose. I've seen Jackie Brown and Kill Bill 1&2 and both movies were great - they had a point they had a plot and they had substance. Even From Dusk Till Dawn was way better than this flick.

Warning: not everyone will love this movie.  That aside, the rest of you will hold this movie next to such timeless classics as The Godfather Part I and The Usual Suspects, this isn't a ""One-hit Wonder,"" Quentin Tarantino has proven himself perhaps as the best director of our time, second to Francis Ford Coppola, maybe.  No, Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings. This movie is real.  The monolog delivered by John Travolta in Swordfish applies to this movie: no moronic sentences, no bad acting, and a story seemingly flawless.  Yes this movie deserves to be compared to The Godfather Part I, and buy the DVD."

                        ",An American Classic,"Sure ""Pulp Fiction"" - Quentin Tarantino's collection of interconnected crime stories - is a landmark film that has inspired a galaxy of imitators.What's really important is that it is an absolute joy to watch (and listen to!). Tarantino demonstrates his considerable gift for dark humor, smart dialogue, wild plot twists, and undeniable visual style. ""Pulp"" is one of the brightest jewels not just of Tarantino's impressive oeuvre, but of American cinema as a whole.Credit must be given to the large cast (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kietel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, etc, etc, etc) that positively sizzles.""Pulp Fiction"" is quite simply one of the most original, exuberant, exhilarating, movies ever made."
2 February 2006,simplysoda_19f,0,1,9,Pulp Fiction is a must-see action packed thrill ride!,"Pulp Fiction is like a roller-coaster it has it's ups and downs, but when it's done, you'll want to ride (watch) it again! Quentin Tarantino is a great director and like all his movies he does have a cameo role in the movie, but he's a great director, to me what makes him so great is that he has a different style of mind like any other film director that I've seen.Also, this movie has lot of big named stars, and this is the first movie that i've ever seen these three guys together: Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and last but not definitely least....Bruce Willis. It's a movie about a lot of different people who all work for the same person, Marcellus Wallace. Oh, I forget to mention that Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken and Roseanna Arquette are in the movie as well.It's an interesting movie that you have to watch at least 2 times to understand the story, but if you've seen previous Tarantino movies, you just should know what to expect. The reason I say that, is because there are a lot of flashbacks and flash-forwards in the movie. So, it does get a little confusing there, but all-in-all, I gave this movie a 9, because it's got a great cast under great direction, an original story but brilliant, and a great dance sequence where John and Uma do the twist. Watch the movie, it's great!"

It is very intelligent/clever in terms of script layouts. Performances from the main actors are also very well done. And when you combine these two elements together you get a brillant film. The main contributing factor that shift this film from being just good to greatness is really Tarantino. It can get up to the level of memento, fight club and requiem for a dream. However, still a micro litre behind from  classics like taxi driver, godfather and citizen kane. I give it 8/10"
18 October 1999,Falcon-51,0,0,10,Tarantino's Finest,"You don't go and see a Tarantino written film without expecting to see guns, gore, vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence. It is his style and he is a master at it. The fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself. This particular film was well written (Kudos to Roger Avary for helping Tarantino). The film is definitely Oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Director to name a few. Unfortunately I believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards, but Tarantino and Avary did get Oscars for Writing it.Their is talk about quarter pounders in France, foot massages and what it's like to kill a person. If you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence, rape and drug use you are probably a Tarantino fan already.Finally who cares where Tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be, and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans.

Uma Thurman stole every scene she was in. John Travolta was revolting and I was embarrassed for him trying so hard to act so cool throughout this thing. give me a break!! the whole thing with the rape defines gratuitous violence for the sake of what? trying to prove how tough someone can be? yeah, OK. the whole movie had this trying-desperately-hard-to-be-ultra-cool. all I can say is this film is OVERKILL in a big way. some scenes are OK but most of it should have been scraped. that people like this film as much as they do is a sad commentary on good film making and what people now a days will call brilliant. it's all a.d.d./mtv-pandering to those with the attention span of a gnat."

I didn't get into the program - does that tell you something?I know lots of people loved the film, but I'm afraid it just didn't do it for me. It was WAY too heavy on superfluous dialog. I kept on wanting to yell at the characters to DO something! This is a MOVIE (you know, MOVE-ee) that doesn't move nearly enough. Okay, there are great movies like ""Key Largo"" that are more dialog-heavy than PF, but that's like comparing The Last Supper to a velvet painting.Ultimately, it seems QT was a limited run item. His equally boring ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the laughable ""Jackie Brown"" are just about it. Okay, it's not a BAD movie, just not anywhere near the level of ""Taxi Driver"" or so many other truly great films that too many PF fans seem to be unaware of. It's competently done; has no glaring technical errors. It has the ""novel"" play around with the time elements thing.Overall, it's typical Hollywood: tell everyone over and over again it's great and they'll have to believe it (well, at least for a while).

At some point the fun wears off and you're left with some silly pulp action movie, but those first 2 viewings are gold. That and it not offering any meaningful depth other than simply being fun is why it doesn't quite get top marks (only 7 films do in my book).Still, it's one of the best films you'll ever see if you're in the mood for a romp!"
5 June 2019,soromenho-17987,1,1,10,I double dare you to watch the movie!,"Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90´s. It´s Quentin Tarantino´s masterpiece and is
categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars.
Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom:
Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts.
He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction´s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative,
feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It´s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino´s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent,
bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!"

Chatting with friends in our lives has never promoted the plot, just like a blind chicken chat, so although it drags the rhythm, it brings real and weak drama; and the constant accident is life itself.

Still, it's good enough for 4/10 stars from me.I enjoyed the early royale with cheese stuff, and I particularly liked the Travolta/Thurman evening/chemistry. But in the end, this is a movie that is really about dead bodies, arseholes, screaming, violence and, at 2 1/2 hours, just too long."
27 November 2021,trapp_33,0,2,8,great movie,"The way the events are presented and their interrelationship with each other is very special and good in this movie, and the movie is good in all respects. The characters, the events, the pictorial music, the acting, everything is very good. Truly, Tarantino excelled in this movie and deserves to be watched."
14 March 2002,BrashFink,1,2,8,A modern classic,"I could rant and rave about this film for pages, but that would be pointless.  Just SEE IT, it is that simple.  Brilliant nonlinear story-telling.  The payoff is technically in the middle of the story, but at the end of the movie (robbery scene).  Though in my opinion, not as clever as Reservoir Dogs, the story telling is genius and that it why it won Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary the academy award for best original screenplay."
7 May 2008,blackangelproductions,1,2,10,wow,"I will start by saying that i NEVER give a film a ten because that means that the film has absolutely no flaws and everything has a flaw........but this.I was captivated from start to finish, i never got bored or started to look at other things because i was sick of what i was already looking at. The direction of this highly original film is absolutely brilliant, many thumbs up to Mr. Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs made me a fan of his, this movie made me a crazed nut that loves his work.The attention to detail in every aspect of this film is just staggering as well as the twisted plot and humour. The actors, especially John, Samuel and Bruce were all f***ing brilliant as was the script itself. I have heard many people just say that the amount of language was unnecessary, but heres the heads up, that is the way real people talk, this is a movie with real people in it, their conversations are real, how many movies do you see that has two people talking about big macs and quarter pounders and what they are called in other countries...none.A brilliant film and a must see for film lovers."
15 December 1999,bhicks56,0,0,10,I'm not gonna sing the same ol' praises,"I'm sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie, so I'm just going to write about the little things I enjoy.I'm sure many people love to see this movie over and over again, but since I have so many things memorized (as all of you, I'm sure, Don't Lie!!) I like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time. Too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time, but the exhiliration and thrill is still there.It's so cool how Tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew. Not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all.I also like how Quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings. You might not have noticed (or even have cared for that matter), but in almost every scene there's a little thing going, sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip, ultraviolent cult fave. I like how the scene involving Christopher Walken and the young Butch. Walken almost changes every word in explaining Butch's father's death for the sake of Butch and his mother. Also at the end, if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt, they look like real bystanders in a hold-up.I also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie. Like Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz. I always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other. Not to mention Tarantino putting questions out there for us. What is in that suitcase after all?"
18 December 2002,mtiller12,1,2,9,Great film,"Pulp Fiction is a landmark film and one of the best of the nineties. The story revolves around L.A lowlifes which include,two hitmen,bank robbers and a boxer.All played superbly by John Travolta,Samuel.L Jackson and Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarintino`s script is brilliant and whoever has seen this would agree with me,it has excellent dialogue and everything fits in. Everything about this movie is top notch,the acting,the screenplay,the cinematography and direction. Overall a defining moment in film history and a great film.10/10"
3 June 2008,ad_upclose,0,1,8,A highly entertaining dialog-oriented flick!,"A fantastic dialog- oriented movie. This is easily Tarantino's best effort. Though I did not appreciate this movie the first time I saw it, I now know why it is a cult classic. The characters are good and the dialogs are intriguing. S.Jackson was...(read more) easily the best actor for me, delivering the best lines, while the rest of of the cast was also good. The duo of Jackson and Travolta goes down as one of my favorites ever; they both complemented each other really well. The chemistry between Thurman & Travolta was also quite effective.This dark comedy also has some great funny moments which never lets the movie drag despite its lengthy running time.Overall, a highly entertaining dark comedy packed with great lines & acting. A Tarantino classic."

I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year!! and probably the equivalent every year since it was released.Tarantino's mark on all his films is evident - and yes it's obvious he's using his childhood experience or dreams? in his fantastic ability to make stunning films.& to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold? Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers, nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons.One of the best Directors & Writers ever!"

                        ","Nice work, Quentin.","Okay, I'll start off by saying that if u haven't seen this movie yet, do so immediately. Now that that's out of the way, I'll go on to actually review the film.
First off. In case my user-name wasn't a good enough indication, I am a huge fan of this film. It's one of my top 5 movies of all time, and in my opinion, is one of the best movies ive ever seen, obviously.to be fair, yes, it does have its flaws. Like, I really didn't care for the whole Bruce Willis sub-plot, although it did tie in fairly nicely with Jackson and Travolta's storyline, I just didn't really care for it all that much... and Maria de Medeiros' character REALLY got on my nerves. But, with that said, I can't find any further fault with this film.As I said, it's one of the best films I've ever seen, and probably ever will see. I can't really simplify it much more.Basically: It ain't better than Reservoir Dogs, but it's still a damn good film. Go see it ASAP.9/10"
29 October 2017,rebeccalucy,0,1,9,Is an extremely unique film but a must watch!,"Tarantino creates a fantastic experience with interesting characters, twists and a breaking conventions of other films. He uses cinematography to demonstrate meaning in the film, as well as to just show great shots. Has some dark and disturbing scenes, but they keep you interested in the situation. All actors are fantastic and stick to the tone of the film really well. Both points help to keep you sympathetic to some quite horrible characters. Not once was I able to guess where the film was going, which deserves a lot of praise. A must watch for any film fan."

19 April 2005,Hector_The_Toad,1,3,10,A great film.,"This is an excellent movie. It has been given a lot of negative publicity because of its violence, language, drug use etc. however none of it is actually gratuitous and the language and drug use in context. After all, Pulp Fiction is a gangster film. A number of things make Pulp Fiction one of the great classics of all time and a must see for all movie fans. It is humorous, action-packed, exciting and is thought-provoking. Pulp Fiction is basically three chronologically jumbled stories concerning two hit men (Travolta and Jackson); two armed robbers (Roth and Plummer) a drug dealer (Stoltz); a prize fighter (Willis); a criminal underworld boss (Rhames) and his wife (Thurman). Apart from the absolutely ingenious plotting of the film, Pulp Fiction also puts across the messages of redemption and faith, often in hysterical ways. The bloody action is prevalent in the film however infrequent and not distracting. The coarse language can be a detracting factor, with strong language throughout however this all must be taken in context. Overall a fantastic film and Tarantino must be applauded, not condemned for it."
14 June 1999,movieman9,0,0,8,"Dialogue shines in this creative bloodbath, but where's the potatoes?","If Pulp Fiction is going to be remembered for anything one hundred years from now, it will definitely be for the unique intellectual conversations John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson engage in before they blast their next assignment. It will also be memorable for bringing Travolta back to Hollywood with a bang (pardon the pun). I even might recall such terms as ""dead n***** storage"" and ""Royale with cheese."" The only thing I cannot understand is where there is enough genius or wonder about this film to declare it as one of the top 100 best films from the AFI. I'm not arguing that Pulp Fiction is not a terribly original and thoughtful trilogy, but why the huge amount of critical hype? (And by the way, I prefer to call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese.) Rating: Three stars."
28 May 2005,w_harwood,1,2,10,If you don't like this movie you don't like movies.,"I saw this movie a long, long time ago and I fell in love. It has everything you could ask for in a gangster movie. Dark and gritty at times, slick and sick at others. Wonderfully well written dialogue, a whole cast of the best actors Hollywood has to offer the world. Samuel L. Jackson is so good in this movie it hurts, from his brilliant spiritual executioners speech to the hilarious banter kept up the whole way through with Travolta - who probably put in his best ever performance in Pulp Fiction. Amanda Plummers performance made for one of the most enthralling introductions ever and Plummer, Jackson, Travolta and Tim Roth made for an electrifying exit. Not forgetting Bruce Willis in one of the funniest gangster styled stories I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Then there is Uma Thurmans brilliant dance scene with Travolta................ the movie is like a movie lovers wish list, with star after star after star taking this movie to new heights with every line.Pulp Fiction is brilliant, inventive, engrossing, enthralling, funny, fast paced excitement from beginning to end. I love this movie and it will forever be in my top 10 all time classics. If you haven't watched this movie then you are missing out big time, if you don't like this movie then you need to go back and watch it again. The direction alone is enough to get this movie 7/10, the cast puts it up to 8/10, the story gets it to 9/10, and the dialogue makes this movie score a perfect 10/10. I do not give perfect ratings lightly, in fact this is the one and only time I have ever said a movie was perfect but this truly does deserve it's rightful place as not only a classic but a brilliant piece of modern Hollywood history. Well done Quentin Tarantino, this was and always will be an absolute master piece and I cannot think of a way to make this movie any better.Fantastic! More please!"
4 September 1999,macphersont,4,18,8,I cannot believe that this movie was liked by anyone.,"Pointless, violent drivel.  I have heard this called the best movie of the 90's... sad sad commentary about the state of movies in the 90's.  Pure crap.  If you want to see a similar movie with at least some redemption watch the Usual Suspects, at least it had a point."
9 May 2000,dave fitz,0,0,10,Amazing film,"Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Reservoir Dogs, his promising debut film. It is simply an amazing film. It's a very intense, fast-paced movie with alot of unusual characters played out by an outstanding cast. The dialogue in this film is hilarious, particularly John Travolta's Vincent and Samuel L. Jackson's Jules. The ""Big Mac"" scene is a classic. The screenplay won a well-deserved Oscar. The story is complex. There were alot of things I noticed on future viewing that I'd missed the first time, probably because I was laughing too hard. The cast is large and features alot of top actors: Travolta, Jackson, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis and many others in smaller roles. Christopher Walken makes a very brief, but memorable appearance.
Pulp Fiction is a completly original film, unlike anything I've ever seen. It was chosen as one of the top 100 films by the AFI. It's one of my favorite movies, one I can watch over and over and not get tired of it."

8 July 2014,eddie052010,0,2,10,One of the best films of the 90's.,"Pulp Fiction. What is there left to say about it? From it's countless reviews, accolades and the fact that it redefined cinema should already tell many how brilliant this movie is and how it's legacy has changed the face of cinema forever. With all of that praise, many have talked about it and analyzed it to death, so it would imply that there is simply nothing left to talk about. However, as I love this film so much and really like writing reviews, I will also discuss what a masterpiece this film is.Firstly, the way the story is told is fantastic, as it does it in a non- linear fashion, each focused on a certain bunch of characters and their actions, and how some of those actions affect the other stories. Sure the separate plots maybe simple on their own, but the way they mesh together in this film is quite beautiful. Sure, not all of the stories are great here, as there are one or two slow, boring ones that you have to sit through, but you will be rewarded with other great and exciting stories to make up for it. The fact that each story has about 20-40 minutes of screen time allows each story to breath and leave an impact, something which many of it's copycats (Snatch for example) fail to realize. As it is told in a non-linear fashion, meaning that certain stories happen after others, it allows for many surprises along the way. It is like 4-6 short films for the price of one and most of them are fantastic and offer you a different experience with each story.The first story is about a couple of gangsters, Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield who are going to carry out a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. What follows is a hilarious mix of violence, comedy and Kahuna Burgers. The same thing can be said of their other stories one of which involves them accidentally killing a hostage and having to clean the car before time runs out as they have parked in a friend's garage whose wife is coming home. This is story is definitely the most comedic in the film as there are the most jokes and humiliations in it, particularly with Vincent and Jules being very humorlessly clumsy. Their most action packed story is the final one where a diner is held up and Vincent and Jules are caught right up in the middle of it, being held hostage by a gangster called Pumpkin and his loose cannon wife. While there is a lot of humour here, it is definitely the most tense due to the situation and how psychotic both Pumpkin and his wife are. It isn't the most violent however. This is where Bruce Willis, playing a boxer called Butch comes in. After killing another boxer in a fight that he was meant to lose, Butch quickly escapes with his girlfriend and intend on leaving the country. There is one problem however, he left his gold watch behind, an item that has been in his family for generations. So he has to go back in order to reclaim the watch. This is definitely both the most violent and the most surprising story, seeing as how it takes a turn into the exploitation and samurai genres. However, the transition of genres is a smooth one considering how it keeps with the tone of the film and is played more over the top, which considering how this film is partly a black comedy fits.The only dud here is when Vincent has to look after Marsellus Wallace's wife, Mia. It is such a slow story, and there is barely any sort of excitement in the story despite plot points like an overdose. There is hardly any chemistry between Vincent and Mia and Mia herself is quite a boring character. She's just a bland party girl. Uma Thurman does her best, but even she can't rescue the story from blandness.However, that is my only compliant with the film. Another good thing about it is the dialogue. Sure, like Reservoir Dogs, it discusses hardly interesting things, but it works and can often times be really funny. There is also a lot more character development in this than Reservoir Dogs, with most of the characters at least having a different personality to them, and as in these stories there are many duos, there is much chemistry between the characters. Vincent for example, is a calm quiet man who really doesn't want to screw up meanwhile Jules is a much more psychotic, religious and dangerous character who is thinking of retiring soon. Butch is a paranoid person who only manages to get through life with his wit and often by the skin of his teeth. Marsellus is a very though person who while a person who shouldn't be double- crossed does care about his wife and what happens to himself, and not even he can protect himself all the time. There are also some stylistic choices I really like as well. The soundtrack is great (if not as good as Reservoir Dogs), the film has a great loose tone which allows for a lot of fun and there is even some ambiguity as well, which I won't spoil for you here. Overall, this is by far one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. It is a mixture of many things and many genres which all mesh together to give us a spectacular experience. Despite some problems here and there, this a complete masterpiece that improves on Reservoir Dogs while being great on it's own. If you haven't seen it already, go and see it, because you are missing out on great cinema otherwise."
1 May 2020,dinizgb,1,1,10,A must watch for all audiences and generations,"The first time I saw Pulp Fiction amazed me like not many others movies could did it. Not because his trend to violence, dark humor or some kind of sarcastic display of an especific subject or era, but for its genius tone.A rollecoaster sequences of brillance and madness that pursues you with all kinds of surprises, twists, and ways to put on full state of trance until it ends.All put together on a clever non chronological plot with overhelming good direction and editing. Samuel L Jackson was killer on his role, a full scene stealer, and all others technical aspects were on shape to the rest.This is an obligatory title to everyone who loves good films, either to art or fun oriented."
22 January 2018,BeastMovieAddict,7,19,1,This movie was dumb,I came into this movie hearing it was amazing and truly a classic. But when I watched it I was extremely confused on why people liked it there was barely any story and was boring with 1 joke that I didn't even catch when someone pointed it out it was unamusing and was a waist of time.
31 August 2019,dafoat,0,1,10,My Favorite Tarantino,"This movie has been debated and analyzed and dissected for years. I could make a lot of detailed arguments for why I think it works so well. But the simple truth is that when I saw this movie for the first time, on opening day of its original release, I had one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. And it's one of those films that I could rewatch again and again. It's a masterpiece."

                        ",QuentinTarantino at his best,"Pulp Fiction is gaining that special status as time goes by. It is becoming a film classic and a must see for generations now coming of age. A metaphor for what Tarantino does here with the storyline is what a magician does with torn paper. We all know the trick...the magician has a participant from the crowd take a piece of paper and tear it up in front of the audience. He places the paper into a top hat, waves the magic wand, and voilà...the paper is whole again.Tarantino does that with the storyline. Scenes shift to different time sequences yet all tie together at the end. The genius is that the viewer must now take the scenes and rearrange them to understand the true sequence. It is, by all accounts, brilliant.The film is responsible for resurrecting the career of John Travolta. At this time Travolta was somewhat of a failed commodity in Hollywood. His performance here proved he could do some seriously good acting. Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhimes, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman all provide standout performances as do all the other actors. Of special note are two of the greatest actors in Hollywood who had somewhat small roles. As Shakespeare said ""there are no small parts, just small actors"". That is why Harvey Keitel is so memorable in his role, and Christopher Walkin in his.Rent the movie, buy the movie, tape it from cable (do not see it on network TV you'll hate yourself if that is the way you see it) but see this movie. After you've seen it once, think about it a little bit and then wait a little while and see it again...that is how good this flick is!"

6 January 2000,Sharkey360,0,0,10,Incredible!,"I must say that Pulp Fiction caught me totally surprised with its artistic story telling and dialogue. Quentin Tarantino is the factor behind this and the cast are perfect for the story. John Travolta's performance here is probably the best I've ever seen from him and his dance here is the greatest he performed. Pulp Fiction requires quiet a bit of thinking to endure the story, because if you're the type who only likes special effects or who does not think and listen, you'll easily get turned off. Understanding what you hear and see here is the key and I recommend this film to anyone who can. Don't listen to those pro-life supporters, anti-violence supporters, special-effects-lovers...go watch this film!"

9 August 2011,brodlimmel,0,2,8,One of the best in film,"This movie is the best Quentin Tarantino film to date. The whole story is just so wonderfully written that you love ever second of it. My personal favorite is the jumpy time-line he does and the integrated story telling it just mushes everything together into one great film.Now I've given it a lot of praise but there are flaws too as in the character Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) she is one of those characters that just annoys me and honestly she slows down the movie. But that is about the only flaw in it.People who wouldn't enjoy this film besides people who hate good movies are people who don't like dark humor or blood,drugs and suggestive themes.This is one of the few films that I have actually bought the soundtrack to because it is just that good.Overall don't barrow or rent this film buy yes buy it on blu ray and enjoy this classic film for the ages."

28 August 2015,mikeburdick,0,2,6,Clever but derivative and hollow,"Admittedly, ""Pulp Fiction"" was incredibly seductive when I first saw it in the theatre (as was ""Reservoir Dogs""). It was so un-Hollywood in many ways. It mashed together French New Wave with schlocky exploitation with Hong Kong action with gangster films, etc. Maybe that's enough to make it a notable film. Certainly, to any casual American film-goer, Tarantino is very interesting and entertaining. However, after a couple of decades of exploring world cinema, ""Pulp Fiction"" drops a couple of pegs. All the clever dialogue, quirky music choices and obscure film references can't conceal the fact that there's very little story and you really don't care much about the characters.This is not to say the actors aren't terrific, because they are (other than Tarantino himself, who is dreadful). Samuel L. Jackson is particularly intense. But it's a bit too much style over substance. Great to have authentic, human dialogue, but better if you get to know the characters and care to follow their journey. Sure, there's suspense, in that you wonder who might get done next, but hard to care whether they do or what that might mean to the other characters.I also feel ""Pulp Fiction"" borrows far too much from other films. Some will perhaps say, ""it's Tarantino's thing,"" ""it's not lifting, it's homage"" or ""it adds a layer of depth for film fans."" But come on, that's really a copout. You can be influenced and even wear your influences on your sleeve, but there are scenes and ideas that are straight lifted from Godard, Woo, Aldrich, Boorman, Besson and Kubrick, to name a few. In the end, after you're through stripping away the ""homage,"" the casual violence, and the suspenseful threats of violence, you've got some colourful dialogue skits delivered by some fine actors. But it leaves you wondering, what was the point of it all?"
28 June 2015,tonybaggot,2,5,6,Not as good as Reservoir Dogs,"Pulp Fiction is good, but it's not as good as Reservoir Dogs. The reason for this is that after his debut with Dogs, Tarantino no longer felt obliged to make his films in any way realistic. I know Dogs is derivative and probably not even realistic, but there is a certain suspension of disbelief - a humbleness in terms of realism - that Tarantino never felt obliged to observe again.I love The Bonny Situation especially. I love many aspects of the film. But it's too retro and silly. Dogs is more real and shocking.Jackie Brown I feel he tried again to get the realism, but since then has simply not bothered. It's like he's said to himself: to hell with it... this is the way I am..."
24 January 2020,eyster-23938,1,1,10,Tarantino's magnum opus,"This is the film that confirmed Tarantino as being not only a top writer in Hollywood but as a stylish director as well. ""Pulp fiction"" pulls you in from the first moment and doesn't let go.Whatever a person could want from a film, ""pulp fiction"" delivers. Fast and witty dialogue, stylish direction, strong performances, flawless editing, fun and popular songs, and a unique approach to telling the story. Quentin is one of the few writer/directors that has the ability to have a movie be highly accessible as well as being filled with true style and entertaining substance. It's art that everyone loves. I've never met a person who didn't like pulp fiction and it's rare to meet someone who hasn't seen it. All these actors are giving career best performances from Samuel L Jackson to Harvey keitel, hell, even John travolta got an Oscar nomination for his role as the lead, Vincent Vega. The writing has a good ebb and flow between comedy and drama, sometimes a combination of the two. I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. I'm just writing this review so I can strengthen my writing and this is my first review so cut me some slack. Don't be a square and get ready for an adrenaline fueled masterpiece of a movie."

Before watching this movie, I thought that Reservoir Dogs was the best movie ever, but I was so wrong.This movie is absolutely amazing. His choice of actors and actresses had really made this movie what it is, especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. The storyline may seem confusing at first, but Tarantino gathers up the loose ends and ties it up like a true professinal director does. The soundtrack is so catchy, and its balance of violence and good lines made this movie enjoyable. Also I have to say that this movie has reserructed John Travolta's and Bruce Willis's careers.This movie is a must see, so GO AND SEE IT."

Called Pann's, I think. Cheap diner, big portions. Tons of Pulp Fiction pictures on the wall. Like the film, the food's greasy, but tasty. How's that for a shallow parallel?"

18 September 2003,kingtanichi,0,2,10,The epitome of perfection,"Most people I know have a lot of movies they really enjoy, and singling out one favourite is often an arbitrary matter. For me, however, this is definitely a leading contender. It never loses impact no matter how many times you see it. The name Pulp Fiction is synonymous with the name Quentin Tarantino, and frankly, I wonder how many people in the industry have such a flattering pseudonym.The script is the stuff of legend by now, and rightly so. The sort of simple, off-hand wit it contains seems deceptively simple line-by-line, but creating such deep, likable characters out of it is something amazing. That Tarantino manages to juggle its narrative and continuity so perfectly while maintaining this is triply amazing.Tarantino also brings out his cast's strengths such as to make John Milius look like a rank amateur. Anybody who knows Ving Rhames only from Con Air or M:I-2 will be amazed here. To anybody for whom Bruce Willis and Die Hard are one and the same -- prepare for a surprise. As for Uma Thurman, she could not be further from Dangerous Liaisons. The list goes on and on.And so, I say to Forrest Gump: Go back to Greenbow, Alabama, and leave those ill-gotten Oscars at Jackrabbit Slim's where they belong!"
9 April 2020,Christian_Ortiz,1,1,10,EPIC MASTERPIECE,There are some films that simply change the way we look at people. This is one of those films. Dynamic storytelling. Unapologetic grit. Swagger. This is the movie that inspired me to make films.
2 January 2006,MovieMusings,0,1,9,A study in redemption,"Warning - mild spoilers.For Tarantino, this seems to be an idea he is contemplating (thorugh various analogies and story lines in various of his movies).Those who are easily distracted will miss it. Although violence is a hallmark of Tarantino films, that's not what it's all about. In this one, 6 people are entwined in a collision course with redpemption. Some will be changed, some will not. The two primary characters who develop are Jules and Ringo. They are surrounded by a number of characters who do not display any real development, yet themselves experience situations they are drawned into and emerge on the other side having been redeemed.Redemption is the final aim of the entire Godfather series, which many consider to be among the greatest movies of all time. And, another, Shawshank REDEMPTION, again explores this theme. And hey, isn't that what ""Return of the Jedi"" was all about? Clearly, the idea is deep-rooted and forms the basis for a good storyline.Tarantino's process is masterful, artistic, challenging."

Not only does it have an all-star cast including numerous A list actors, with especial stellar performances from the stories main duo of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson. But despite the superb cast and amazing story, the most stand out part of this movie is the creative way it was told. Not only was this creative but it was also executed flawlessly, at no point does one feel lost or confused throughout the entire movie, adding a new spin on on the genre. This is by far Tarantino's best work, and a personal favorite."

There are ample of examples of bad photography throughout the movie. I am 49 and for me it's a complete waste of my time. Uma Thurman, John Travolta and Bruce Willis were brilliant though.There is nothing in this movie that will leave a mark in your mind or soul. It's a style-over-substance.

And its as if they did it all on one take. the acting is the only halfway descent thing about it, and thats because of the obvious triple A lineup.this movie is very boring. flat out. i have seen more action and better writing in a Spanish daytime drama. there seems to be about 8-9 short films one after the other, with only slight relevance to one another. while me and my wife hated this movie, we love all of the inside jokes we play about with each other now, like how when we go out for icecream and we get a cherry, my wife dramatically sucks and licks the cherry for 5 minuets making fun of the jackrabit slims scene. i actually highly recommend watching this movie so you can see how horrible it is for yourself."
28 February 2010,rhett_black,1,2,8,Pulp Fiction Review,When watching Pulp Fiction for the first time in 1994 I felt confused but promised myself that I would watch it again when I was more mature & able to digest such a clever production. Recently I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this film again & easily can put it in Tarantino's top 3 behind Reservoir Dog's & From Dusk Till Dawn. The film is clever in every way but especially the way it explores the past & present & how you develop a liking to Tarantino's characters who are killers & criminals. Each character is a hero in his or her own way & it is riveting viewing to find out what happens to them next in their individual story. So what's it missing? Not much besides that fact that it is a film that you need 'to watch' to understand it & it must be taken with tongue in cheek at times due to it's black humour. Two more reasons to watch it.

17 June 2003,T-MACK,1,2,10,QT's classic film of contemporary culture,"I mean, that's what pulp fiction is, isn't it?Anyway, Pulp Fiction is one of those few films that hit big and then are remembered long after.  Usually, it take time for a film to get noticed and then become a classic (Citizen Cane) but some hit big and stay big (Star Wars), generally increasing in popularity as time flies by.  If Pulp Fiction is the Star Wars of the '90s, then I pity the kid who buy's the Vega trigger-happy.In fact, from how the media plays this film out, (EW) Pulp Fiction must be the defining film of the '90s.  The people who bought tickets to this film were the children of the drug swinging hippies of the '60s, and those trippy parents bought tickets because well, they ain't getting any younger.  The moment this film landed in Cannes, it was an instant sensation, and well, it propelled director Tarantino to heights and hype as a director not seen since another directors second flop.Pulp Fiction is a classic and if it is to be remembered as the defining film of the decade or the truth that QT is the real deal, then that certainly is the real pulp fiction."
24 July 2006,Syrchek,0,1,9,Thank god Mr. T saved the best for last.,"OK, where to begin? First, why did it take soooo long to see this movie? I have no idea, I guess I see to many of the latest flicks and don't pay a lot of attention to stuff that's more than 5 years old. The other reason must be that this flick is less on TV than Forrest Gump for instance. I've seen Gump ages ago, but Pulp just dodged and dodged my proximity. Who knows, maybe I was afraid of the disappointment of seeing 'the best of the best' and then begin to wonder what's left? Now I'm not wondering what's left, just why was the movie that different from my expectations? I just expected something... bigger. A bigger, more important plot. I won't get into the details, but it evolves around a group of small criminals, who's lives change because of a few incidents. Nothing really that big. If we get to certain characters, like Uma Thurman for instance, it's a pretty insignificant character. The same I felt for Harvery Keitel. Now really for a film on this level you don't expect your characters to go dry. But the fact is that some of the actors didn't do that much for the film at all. Just the opposite of what you've heard from your friends (or suspected from the film poster). An hour and a half or more into the movie I started to wonder if this is it? People consider this to be the single best crime/thriller of the 90's and so far it hasn't been all that. As it's already well known, Tarantino likes to make his films feel nonlinear. But still, we get the best for last, ending up exactly where we stared. My favorite part of the film. The best laughs and thrills were in my opinion from those scenes. Someone once wrote: 'We don't judge films on what they are, but how they are about it'. And that's the thing with Pulp Fiction. I mean there are hundreds of films with drugs involved, gun shooting, gangsters, all sorts of violence and just what in the world makes this one so significant? And a famous saying goes: 'The devil is in the details' and so is Pulp. And all I can say is: Just freakin' see it already!......... -5/5 ........."
18 April 2001,flip304,0,1,10,My favorite film of all time,"I remember watching this film when I was 13. The film changed my entire view of films and what they could be. I used to only watch the films the had super-action in them. From when I was 8 up to when I was 13 my favorite films were ""Terminator 2"", ""Die Hard"", and ""Predator"". Now, I still think that those are good films, especially the first two, but now my eyes were open to a whole new world of film.     I had never heard of talking for the sake of talking. Do what the characters say have anything to do with the plot what so ever, not most of the time. But those conversations are probably the most important thing in the movie. It helps tell who the character is faster than anything else could.     The performances in the film were all outstanding. I'm not mad that Travolta didn't win for Best Actor, Hanks was brilliant as Forrest Gump. But I do think Samuel L. Jackson should have gotten a lot of awards for his performance as Jules. Harvey Keital was absolutely brilliant as The Wolf. His episode was my favorite of all of them.     A lot of people have ripped off Tarantino's style. But now it seems that every film that has violence in it is compared to Tarantino. I think he had a huge inpact on the film industry, but not that big. Otherwise he is my favorite filmmaker out there right now. He has yet to dissapoint me. 10/10"

26 November 2005,vic_1,1,2,10,The greatest film of the 90's,"This, along side the professional and good fellas, is the greatest film of the 90's. Highly original and unpredictable, this film shows the greatness of its creator Quentin Tarantino.The film is about 3 stories about 1 story. One about a hit-man and his boss wife, one about a washed up boxer double crossing the mob (with a great homage to deliverance) and the third about two hit men ""accidently"" blowing the head off local scum Marvin.This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen for many reasons. Apart from its originality this film is full of brilliant performances by Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thruman and Bruce Willis to name a few. The direction is fantastic. The writing is incredible. One of the stand out things about this movie was the dialog, proved in a scene with Christopher Walken. This is a violent movie with very good wit. It was also a very influential film with dozens of rip offs following its release.Truly one of the greatest films ever. This movie has put Tarantino in the history books and no film I've seen since has beaten its originality and its excellence."

Samuel Jackson,Harvey Keitel,Bruce Willis,John Travolta,Uma Thurman.Christopher Walken and all the other actors deliver excellent performances.Quentin Tarantino has created an excellent follow up to Reservoir Dogs, using his infinite knowledge of cinema to paint his masterpiece.If they only did more films like this one........."
2 December 2002,ravenmccoy_ff5,1,3,10,Tarantino is God!!!,"Before watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I had no idea what it was about. My Mum had told me not to watch it, but as I was a typical 16 year old it made me want to watch it more. The first time I watched the film I was at school and it was too noisy to hear and follow the story as anyone will know due to it's non-linear narrative. I borrowed the film and watched it at home, again and again and again. I was hooked. After watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I bought ""Reservoir Dogs"" and was once again met with the feeling that this guy, the director is a genius. Since then I have seen ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Four Rooms"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". I have unfortunately not yet got round to seeing ""True Romance"" or ""Jackie Brown"" but believe me they will be worth the wait I'm sure.Returning to ""Pulp Fiction"" I can without a doubt say that this is my favourite movie in the whole world, although every film by Quentin Tarantino is to me breathe taking in some way, the cast, stories, direction and overall look of a film, to me make it the best of his work and anyone else's. John Travolta is a winning star in my eyes and when paired with the stunning cool of Samuel L. Jackson, the die hard persona that is Bruce Willis, the over powering presence of Ving Rhames and other cast members such as Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Tim Roth to name a few all add to the fascinating insight into life as a gangster. The dialogue is quick witted, cool and intelligent yet is so powerful with extracts from the bible placed perfectly in order to change murder into a scene as close to beauty as such a scene can be.I would recommend for anyone who has even a half a brain cell to see this film, even if it is just so they turn around and say ""I don't like it"" it is the sort of film that will eat away at you until you finally admit that there is something within it that you love. SEE THIS FILM, it's your lose if you don't."

23 May 2004,sublime501,0,1,9,"See it for what it is--violence, swearing, sex, and drugs. In other words, an awesome movie.","After watching PULP FICTION, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It felt a little odd calling it a ""great"" film, because it is essentially just a lot of violence, swearing, sex, and drugs. Or so you'd think.In reality, this movie has true character depth. Every character is so complex and interesting that you have to care for even the sleaziest, and each character never fails to fascinate and compel you.It's the story of two mob hit men, two diner bandits, and a boxer whose lives intertwine in various ways. The subplots are pretty complex, and the way that the movie goes out of chronological order makes it a lot more interesting. At least eight people are killed, or if not, badly injured. And nearly every sentence contains at least one swear word. There are a few graphic and memorable sexual innuendos, and countless drug references.But let's be honest. Although the script is classic (who doesn't know the ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" scene?) and the direction is, as always, great from Mr. Quentin Tarantino, PULP FICTION would be nothing if not for the truly perfect cast.This movie would definitely not be considered as classic as it is if it weren't for the cast that supports it. Every single cast member is brilliant and executes their role perfectly. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make a perfect team and have a wonderful chemistry. Bruce Willis surprised me in being a very good actor (although maybe I haven't seen enough of his movies to judge him). Uma Thurman is wonderful, and so is the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone is just perfect.Although the cast doesn't have a whole lot to fall back on, other than the classic script and great direction, they truly make this movie what it is--a mob classic with depth. If you don't say out loud, ""Cool!"" when somebody gets shot in the head, this movie may not be for you. And if you can't accept PULP FICTION for what it is (which IS violence, swearing, sex, and drugs), then you won't like it. If you can see what it's meant to be and just sit back and enjoy it, you most likely will be very impressed. I was.My approval. 9.5/10."

21 March 2005,Imaginist,1,3,10,Pulp Fiction (5/5 stars),"Synopsis: I really can't tell you much about this film because I do not want to ruin the experience. This is one of those movies that is best left a secret, but what I can tell you is that it's legendary, remarkable, and re-watchable. Each scene is simply classic and the dialog is thick but so incredibly clever that one hungers for it. The acting is absolutely fabulous. John and Uma have such chemistry during the ""dance scene""--it was engaging and enthralling. Samuel L. Jackson delivers his infamous ""speech"" with such fervor and vengeance that the words are as bullets. I also remember laughing heavily at the dark humor and simple bizzareness of this gem. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a quirky gangster film on its surface but when one digs a little deeper it is a story about redemption. Notice the difference between the fates of John and Samuel's characters, and also notice how Bruce redeems himself. This would all be well and good enough as it is, but Quentin is not done yet. Not only does he bring forth an arsenal of brilliant directing (his classic ""car trunk"" shot), but he also makes a circular film (the beginning and the end are the same). This movie is great, just simply fantastic. And another lovely bonus is that ""Pulp Fiction"" never gets old, which is something hard to come by nowadays. ""Pulp Fiction"" is probably the best movie of the 90's and is certainly one of the best films of all time, and I mean that. The only people who will not like ""Pulp Fiction"" are dumbasses (who will get confused by the story format), the squeamish (who don't like gruesome screen violence), and right-wingers (who think that sex,violence, and profanity are the earmarks of a bad movie). All and all I give ""Pulp Fiction"": 5 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic 2005 Imaginist"
1 January 2008,knuckles_and_sonic,0,2,10,A Masterpiece,"This is one of the films that you really have to watch to understand. Mere words cannot describe it. Basically Three stories surrounding the lives of a few people are told separately but everything all adds up. Also this movie is hilarious especially the last story. The um incident in the car with Travolta and Jackson had me laughing for 5 minutes straight. The dialogue is witty, the acting is superb and the stories themselves are bizarre especially the second one with Willis. This is the perfect film. Repeated viewings are a must with a film of this calibur. I really wonder what was in the briefcase although everybody else does as well.

                        ","Great cast, plot, acting, and directing","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said.  I guess my favorite attribute about this movie is the unique direction by Quentin Tarentino.  Instaed of having an average crime drama with lots of cool killing like most movies, he intertwined three different stories and one cool scene into a superb look at crime.  Tarentino makes criminals look not as much like one-dimensional Gods, as most movies do, but he makes them look like average human beings that have morals, weaknesses, and personalities. He shows how crimianls make mistakes, and that their reasons for killing aren't just for the hell of it.  He shows how criminals think, feel, react, etc.  Besides that, the cast is just exceptional.  Harvey Keitel, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc. all make the movie experience more fun.  They all are wonderful stage presences, to say the least.  Another cool thing about the film that is often overlooked is it's image.  It has this image that is just impossible to describe, like how American Beauty or Fight Club moth have their images.  The colors, the sets, the dialouge, the characters all come together to create this image, and, let me tell you: it's just awesome.  It's a fun movie with witty dialouge. I can't get enough of this movie.  And, oh yeah, the infamous basement scene with the...I won't give it away.  It's very awful and disgusting but it's not like the entire movie is centered around it, so just watch it, and see how it plays a vital part in the development of Bruce Willis's charcater. See it, you'll love it (But first see Resovoir Dogs."""

17 May 2000,Brest,1,2,10,The The miracle-film of the decade: a conversational roller-coaster.,"There are many great movies that I've seen, truly. But no movie like this one has become part of my life, like a true friend that you love to spend time with, from time to time, as `Pulp Fiction' did. Why? Is it a miracle? After all, it has nothing kinetically special: no news and dazzling fx, no strange location, no huge names starring (except for Willis, only a thick bunch of excellent `almost stars', and Travolta was no longer high-rated before PF), no outrageous sex or violence scenes. But it has the Word. Quentin Tarantino would rather NOT make any other movie after this: it is inevitable that now the audience expectations are set on PF, and nothing (I mean nothing) will be ever even equal to it. It has the Word. Yes, it has It. The story structure is a round architecture, making everyone unable to re-tell it in the exact order, if asked to. 	 Yet, the Word. Each and everyone script line is so sharp and inspired to turn the whole movie into a conversational roller-coaster. All characters, even the most marginal ones, have memorable lines to tell: those lines are filled with all the selfishness, the greed, the fear and the human weaknesses that we all embody in our ordinary life; only, they are spoken exactly like we have always dreamed to speak, without ever have been able to, at least at the right time. Everything is realistic in this movie: everything except the speeches. It doesn't really matter whether they are spoken by people far less than ordinary or not. They are the real kinetic magic of the film, and I'm not surprised knowing how many merchandising pieces have been sold bearing (some of) the most significant lines spoken by characters. The Word, along with the sublime a-morality of the telling, along with the masterful close-ups, along with the subtle depiction of violence (much less shown than suggested), along with the carving of the most realistic villains ever captured on grotesque cinema; the Word and all of this together make this two hour and a half running movie one of the milestones of the decade."

An absolutely amazing and flawless movie that contains everything that you could possibly expect from a movie done by Quentin Tarantino; a real one-of-a kind movie that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. It deserves 10 stars and the Oscar of the best movie of 1994, which it unfortunately didn't win. Still it's the BEST and fortunately won best Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen Oscar.
Quentin Tarantino is a genius although I didn't like From Dusk Till Dawn but Resevoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction are all great movies!"

                        ",The *WORST* film of the decade...,"Without a doubt, this had to be one of the worst movies ever made. The direction was choppy at best, the plot so convoluted no one could follow it (what little plot there was), and the wonderful actors doing this film wasted both their time and their talent. There is no direction in this storyline whatsoever. This movie is only a vessel for gratuitous violence, sex, and drug use. There are no ""good guys"" in this movie, and no redeeming qualities. But there is a plus to it -- if you happen to have some sort of hallucinogen lying around, the movie is almost bearable. For an equally tasteless pro-drug flick, viewers should check out ""Half Baked""."

There's something to be said about how perfectly Pulp Fiction flows with such a non-linear story line. Quentin Tarantino had already earned his spurs with Reservoir Dogs, and now decided to take everything to the nines with his sophomore film. The beauty of Pulp Fiction is how the story lines are so well intersected, and yet it begins and ends nearly exactly the same way. Not only is it one of the most important films of the 1990s, but it served as a platform for incredible dialogue, a veritable showcase depicting the bleak yet flashy glamour of 90s' LA, and a scenario of sorts of just what ordinary, and not-so-ordinary people can do when under duress."

                        ","Bold, brash, unique....one of the decade's landmark achievements.","It's been about 5 years since this film was unleashed upon the world. There had never been anything like it. Tarantino had avoided the sophomore slump and crafted a film that pilfers from just about anything you can imagine and manages to create one of the most unique films of the decade. It's a crime drama, film-noir, gangster flick, black comedy....you get the idea. True, it's a graphic film: graphic violence, graphic language, graphic drug content, and a graphic rape sequence; it ain't for the squeamish. But it also has some of the most fluid monologues cinema has ever produced. Not to mention that it did wonders for the careers of its principals: Travolta's career was in full-throttle after this one; likewise with Jackson, and Thurman. The foundation was laid with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""True Romance"" - this is the film that established Tarantino as a director of a higher order. And the imitators have been playing catch-up ever since."

                        ",Jules makes this film,"""What country you from Bret? What! Well that ain't no country I've ever heard of. They speak English in what?"" The character Jules makes this film for the classic it is. If Tarantino had thrown in Vince w/ a partner more like himself, then I'd have to say that this would be perhaps the most boring movie I ever saw.
This is a movie, chartered by three separate but revealing short stories, about the same characters. The first begins with a prologue in a coffee shop, then takes you to an apartment where some thugs get capped off by Jules and Vince. Then the next stories' about Vince taking his bosses' wife on a date, and then goes on to tell about a boxer who stiffs Marcelus of a bribe, and then graduates to explain the prologue. Homophobes may not want to watch this one. There is a scene that will make you cringe as I did the first time. The dialogue is what makes this film unique, original, and funny as hell. It is also the masterpiece which had introduced me to crime/action films, which before I had been previously uninterested in."

14 February 2016,samfischer88,0,0,10,Could be the Best Ever,"Pulp Fiction is hard to put into perspective. In every way possible, this is just fantastic. Tarantino showed us brilliance in style, story, and cast. I've seen Pulp Fiction multiple times now, and it is safe to say that this might be the best movie ever put together. This is a different kind of crime and action movie. This is a weirdly authentic. There are some gruesome, yet comedic scenes. This is really what turned Tarantino INTO Tarantino. There are surprises that are dramatic, yet hysterical in how it is presented. Its truly original and has yet to be matched by any movie I've seen.Pulp Fiction won an Oscar for best original script, which it rightfully should have. This script is broken into chapters, presenting different sides of the story. Each chapter is unique, presenting new characters that really piece everything together. Along with the story in general, there are gems of memorable quotes. These powerful lines make the movie even more memorable, as they cause the scenes to stand out among other classic movies.The cast is once in a lifetime as well. Its like the actors and actresses were made for these roles. Travolta. Samuel L. Bruce Willis. Uma. Thats just to name a few. This a star studded cast! They played there parts well, with Travolta and Jackson really being the most memorable to me. Their scenes are spectacular. Travolta was the star, but Jackson had the star quotes. Travolta deserved more recognition for his performance. Jackson's quotes are the ones I remember. His lines will be remembered by viewers forever among the classics.This is a once in a lifetime movie, that really should be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 10/10."
14 June 2020,sallykeller-51142,2,12,1,Pulp,"If you took this final shooting script to an accomplished producer in any other decade you would have been laughed at, the success of this film due to a very young and niche audience is reflective of society in general.Inspiring moments, great visuals, depth and meaning, characters that speak into our own lives, messages that appeal to the mainstream; None of this seems to count any more.I just hope audiences have become more sophisticated since the shock and awe of stylised violence by Mr Tarantino. I make no personal judgement of the man I hear he is great to work with and a gentleman.This would have to be the most overrated film in movie history because everyone wants to be the next nothing that becomes something. Everyone wants to come in outside the studio system. People appreciate when moulds are broken and non linear stories can be told in the indie style that appeals to them. So many love a crescendo of excitement for the simple sake of it, something new or another level of violence they haven't seen before....Your appreciation of this work as a 10/10 is purely fictional, you've been convinced that unique stories without meaning are to be worshiped as something genius. I haven't missed the point. You have, when this work is compared to others on merit.Art is subjective and I accept you love this piece, but it's a younger audience that posts ratings here."

Tarantino is a master of using music in his films, it almost seems as though music is his building block for the film. Tarantino is a man who truly is cinema.

Its clearly just a pointless gimmick that adds nothing to our enjoyment or understanding of the story.2) Pulp Fiction is just a vehicle, like most his other films, for Tarantino to write out his geeky fantasies. And why does he cast himself in his films he's a hideous actor.3) The dialogue. Does everyone always have to be so super cool? Its completely unnatural. The whole style of the film actually irritates me greatly in some sub-conscience was that I cant quite articulate.I write this as I was on Keitels IMDB page and viewed his films as rated by members and almost keeled over in disbelife to see that this geek-fest is rated above Taxi Driver...really, I just dont know anymore. lol. :)"

It isn't even good art. A better, more interesting film that also has a non-linear plot (if you like that sort of thing) is ""Lost Highway""--it's also about the seamier side of life but unlike ""Pulp Fiction,"" really makes you think. I forced myself to watch ""Pulp Fiction"" twice thinking perhaps I missed something the first time--my only conclusion is that most people's standard of a ""good movie"" is pretty low. Sorry if I insulted anyone."

To me, this film is a glaring example of everything wrong with movies today. Shallow characters, glamorization of drugs, sex and crime, gratuitous violence, incomprehensible plot, and Bruce Willis (an ""actor"" I despise) all combine here to make an ""experience"" that left me nearly in tears--of boredom. I forced myself to watch it a second time after hearing everyone raving about this piece of trash, thinking perhaps I had missed something. I didn't. It is very sad to think that Hollywood must stoop so low today to ""entertain."" If you want to see a really *good* movie about the seamier side of life, watch ""Boogie Nights"" or any of the ""Godfather"" movies."

I don't believe all that is said about how it revolutionised  film making or that it is the most important film of the (my) generation (and I did see it in the cinema at the time of it's release).There are many superb scenes in the film but for me, it is neither as exceptional nor shocking as Reservoir Dogs.I suppose this generation is pretty unshockable as far as what is seen on screen is concerned, although this film does have a couple of moments that almost truly shock.  So long as you're over 18 and mentally sound then I recommend it but really, it is only a film after all, if it's a statement of our times, it is only one man's statement (to which of course he's perfectly entitled)."

                        ",Offbeat but excellent,"Original doesn`t even begin to describe ""Pulp Fiction."" How about ""ground-breaking"" or ""extremely innovative"". Being probably one of the most distinctive films of the 1990`s, ""Pulp Fiction"" is an offbeat, gritty, but hysterically funny film about two hitmen, their boss, his crack-addicted wife, a boxer and a few eccentric but fascinating characters and and their bizarre stories. There are about 4 or 5 stories in this film (I can`t remember, I saw this a year ago), that all overlap each other, and they`re not in chronological order either. It sometimes can be confusing, but I`m sure you`ll be able to understand it. The script for this film is sheer genius, as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, the two hitmen, argue about everything from Big Macs to shooting someone in the back of their car. Uma Thurman is radiant as the unconventional, junkie who likes to dance and crack silly jokes. ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn`t really have a plot, it sort of like a collection of a few stories, that don`t really go anywhere. There a few bloody moments, but you`ll be laughing hysterically, it`s THAT MUCH of a black comedy. The film`s low budget is very visible, but that just creates an even more raw atmosphere. ""Pulp Fiction"" is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy an outrageously funny, startlingly original and dark film, this is for you."

This movie is my Citizen Kane, and for a time in my life changed how I viewed movies (now that I'm older I'm a little easier to entertain). Not only is every scene quotable (I knew every line at one point) but the images are forever a part of our canon. The way the story unfolds is like an Aesop Fable, the characters each representing part of ourselves. Are we able to realize a miracle when we see one in the age of cynicism like Jules? Can we walk away from a bad scene, can what be seen be unseen?Or are we ignorant, living our lives matter of factly like Vincent? Will we be able to wash our hands of our mistakes or will we just get something else dirty? Will life literally catch us with our pants down?Maybe we are in a bad situation like Butch, and someone else has control over our lives. We could burn bridges from these people, or we could, with honor, save them from being screwed over (so to speak).Are we thieves trying to stick it to the man like Honey Boney and Ringo? Are we struggling with addiction and dwelling on the past like Mia? Or are we even like Marcellus, losing grasp on the things we once held firm?This movie is a masterpiece, but some people can't look past the grittiness of the story to truly appreciate it.10/10"

It works on so many levels. The dialogue is probably the best part of the movie, it's just incredibly well written and you will remember the quotes for a very long time. Then there's the plot, or the way that it's presented, which is non-linear. It works great here, although often a non-linear plot can be gimmicky. The acting is also top notch - John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give probably their best performances of their careers. The music is also a vital part of the movie, although it's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it fits the movie. This movie just has everything - it's funny, violent, clever. I've seen it countless times already, but it's always fresh when you watch it.

22 June 2022,Dannov747,0,0,7,An exceptional script but devoid of anything but nihilism,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."

And then BANG. He shoots somebody. Lets get it straight. Quinten Tarantino is a genius. As the movie goes, the stories of 2 mobsters, a mobster's wife, a boxer and two ""restaurant"" robbers intertwine in absolutely the most perfect of ways. The two mobsters, played by Jackson and John Travolta, give two Oscar nominated performances in order to bring their characters to life. Uma Thurman, who plays Marsellus Wallace's wife. The scene where she is drugged out and Vega (travolta's character), has to drive adrenaline through her heart, I was sweating in my seat. SO INTENSE. Bruce Willis is also fantastic. Such a great movie, perhaps the greatest ensemble of acting in a movie. Not a best picture winner however. I only say that because Forrest Gump is the greatest film of all time. But that being said, Pulp Fiction wins in essentially any other year."

30 August 2007,PeterWilliamson,0,1,10,Up there with Reservoir Dogs,"One of the best. Definitely up there with Reservoir Dogs, two of the best movies I've ever seen. Pulp Fiction is one of the funniest, intense and, all up, entertaining movies ever. I think that Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors and writers around. Not only one of the best directed movies in years, but probably the best acted and a cast which would beat most movies put together. Humour, gangsters, suspense and Quentin work well together. Definitely worth buying, almost just for the dialog. I recommend it for the people who aren't afraid of some strong themes, violence and course language. If you liked Reservoir Dogs, you'll love this."

30 November 2000,sunhee_yongdae_lee,0,1,10,a great ganster black comedy,"When I first saw this movie on video, I was in 5th grade.  I expected to see a action film because Bruce Willis is in it but after the movie was over, I was confused and totally lost by this movie.The second time I saw it, I was a junior at high school and I was totally fascinated by this movie.  As shown in ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino's ""answer first, question later"" scenes are unique and amusing to watch.  Also, the dialogues are hilarious, such as conversation about foot massages, and actions are bit too violent but also great. I also enjoyed John Travolta and Uma Thurman's twist scens a lot.The actings are superb!!  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman gave their best performances in their careers. Bruce Willis was still pretencious but he was OK."
3 March 2015,salvador-97,1,2,10,A groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking,"What can I say about Pulp Fiction that hasn't already been said before? That it is arguably one of the best movies ever made and that after twenty years since its release remains a dazzling and original piece of brilliant filmmaking? Well, of course I could say all that, but I still wouldn't be making this magnificent movie justice. There's the amazing screenplay, exploding with pop culture references, and whose merits raise far above its plot and are really more related to the brilliant character development and the awesome mix of comedy and tragic that are so beautifully brought to life by the awesome cast. And then of course there's everything else, the amazing direction, the superb editing and the even more superb soundtrack. Tarantino has this ability to select an handful of songs that, far more than just cool and nice sounding (ala ""Goodfelas"" or ""Boogie Nights"", for instance) manage to give meaning to the scenes in which they are played. And that's just one of the million things that makes this movie so special and above all with such an high rewatchability value. And among those things there's also of course the unlikelihood of everything we see happening on screen and the unfolding of events that makes glued to the screen even after dozens of views... Summing up my thoughts, Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking that still manages to dazzle and surprise audiences after 20 years of its release. It's not just one of my favorite movies, it's also the movie that made me look at films from a different point of view, almost ""forcing"" me to love them as much as I love books. Please, if you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it. But get ready, cus' it's gonna be a bumpy ride!"

The fact is no one really knows and no matter how many times you watch it and thing you know other thing throw it in a different direction.
My theory is it is either: Marcellus Wallace's soul . Clues being the plaster, Jules' bible references and his determination to protect the case, the 666 combination amongst others.OR It may be Butch's boxing belt. again references crop up to make you think that it is this. OR it may just be a clever stunt to get people thinking more of an already great film!"
17 March 2005,maawan,9,21,6,Overrated,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."

                        ",And they said nothing was perfect,Yes that's right this movie is perfect. Every crime drama/comedy out there can try as hard as it wishes but it will never ever surpass Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction follows the story of to very likable hit man Vince and Joules (John Travolta and Sam Jackson) and a boxer who is in a lot of trouble (Bruce Willis). There story's are both compelling and original and eventually they run across each other. If you have seen any other Tarentino film you will know how he tells the story with flashbacks and eventually it all comes together. Quinten Tarentino's movies always have a certain amount of character and dialog that make them what they are. Pulp fiction is one of those films which you can't think of anything it lacks. Well I thought may be it could have used more action but if it did it wouldn't be what it is.So all in all buy this movie right now watch it love it remember it because it will be a long time before someone makes another crime drama/comedy this good. My grade:A+ definitely one of the best movies ever.
31 July 1999,Movieman-133,0,0,8,Disturbing...but a little entertaining.,"Well,  the movie was pretty good,   and I guess that it's on the AFI' list because of it's remarkable originality.  The movie is violent,  a little bloodly (could have been much bloodier),  not highly sexual but the slight glimpses are enough to understand(man raping a man),  and only a little nudity- men in shirts off..bruce willis in underwear.   The movie did not go in chronological order and that was fresh and original.  The acting was good,    Uma Thrurman short on screen role was very moving and her on screen time had the most disturbing image of the entire film with her overdosing.     I was surprised that John Travolta was nominated  for an Oscar because he can act better than what he did in this film(Face Off), he was good but it wasn't special,  it was his usual self.  As for all the talk of redemption...,I think it's kind of a crock,  I mean Samuel L Jackson's character is probaly not all that reliable.     The humour--it didn't work and it wasn't funny.    The people pretty much fit their roles and the movie and sountrack was good,  but I don't really see the big deal of it. Watch for film for a new experience but don't go in thinking the movie is highly enjoyable.  8/10 for a well made and original film."

In short, this is my favorite one and I advise anyone to watch it too."

                        ",Some people haven't seen this movie? What????,"There's an expression called the 'sophormore slump,' or something to that nature. It deals in terms of an artists/athletes/etc. who's second effort lack's the success of their initial. In movies, many filmmakers go through this exact struggle (Kevin Smith I'm looking at you.) But, like every rule, there are exceptions. And, oh boy, is this one ever.Quentin Tarantino started his film career by penning the script to 'True Romance.' An enjoyable, yet ultimately forgettable work. He followed that up by directing his desk script, shot on a minuscule budget. That film happened to be 'Reservior Dogs,' and the rest is history. Following the success that was 'Dogs.' QT finds himself in a more comfortable position to make his second film (and I'm sure the fact that he made it independently rather than under a big studio helped.) His sophomore effort was 'Pulp Fiction' and it has changed the cinematic experience from the get-go. This little 8 million dollar film blew up to be a 100 million dollar plus investment, becoming a hit not only in the states, but internationally.Why was it such a hit? The movie speaks for itself. Don't believe me? Read anyone else review who delves into trivial details than provide much of the greatness. The acting is great. The directing is great. The writing is some of the best and wittiest dialogue I've ever heard. The movie somehow manages to be hilariously dark and an exercise in bad-assery (if that's even a word.) 'Pulp Fiction' isn't just required viewing for hardcore movie lovers, it's a required film for anyone of the human race. 'Pulp' will never get old, it will always remain timeless and my favorite movie of all time because of that."
14 October 2018,austinfromdahood,0,1,10,Not a big fan of this acclaimed film,"Now that I think about it, I really should watch more Tarantino films. The only movies I've seen from him is Kill Bill: Volume One, Kill Bill: Volume Two, and the movie I'm going to review today, Pulp Fiction. This is the first movie I saw from Quentin Tarantino, because of all the praise it gets, and I'm not particularly a huge fan of Pulp Fiction. The first time watching it, I was thinking to myself, ""What's the point?"" One of my biggest issues with this movie is that there kinda isn't really a plot. The way I'd describe the ""plot"" of this movie is that there are a bunch of people with journeys of their own and they then are all connected by the end of the movie. That's the best way I could describe this movie, and that aspect of the movie I really didn't like. On a better note, I'll talk about the things I really liked about the movie. The dialogue is on point, it is really spectacular. The dialogue was so fluid, catchy, and really fun. There are some really popular quotes that came from this movie, like the ""royale with cheese"" talk, and the ""I shot Marvin in the face"" thing, and I guess those are pretty cool. The soundtrack and score is pretty catchy, I have to say. The acting is on fire, I think all the actors in this movie are great, they felt like real people, not characters. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, I have to say, have top notch performances. I'm 100% sure that I am the minority saying I'm not a fan of this movie. I just feel like this movie is not for me I guess. The movie is pretty long, at almost 3 hours long, and it really shows cause this movie felt super long and at many times boring. Around the 2nd act especially, was pretty boring throughout. I could see why people like this movie, and I can see why people don't like it, and I'm part of the group of people that don't like this movie. If I could describe this movie in one word it would be ""ambivalent"". There are things in this movie that people would like, and there are things in this movie that people wouldn't like. There will be many people that would disagree with me saying that they thought the movie was amazing, and I can't blame them and everyone has their own opinion on something, we live in a world that has that concept. This movie is one big 'ol mixed bag for me, and I'd give it a 6/10."

the same story but different feeling and understand of the original novel"
12 July 2008,pgear83,0,3,10,A very tasty burger,"Widely considered to be the best film of the past quarter-century and certainly the most influential, the second film directed by Quentin Tarantino is a masterpiece of modern storytelling. The film contains multiple and intersecting story lines and popularized this structural technique, paving the way for such excellent films as Magnolia, Crash and Babel. Likewise, the non-linear chronology of the film was also a likely inspiration for many future films, including Christopher Nolan's Memento. But none of these later films come close to Tarantino's original. The greatest strength of this movie, and indeed all of Tarantino's work, is the writing, particularly in terms of dialog. Characters speak as they do in real life, not just to advance a plot, but about random mundanities as well. Tarantino could have been as great a novelist as he is a filmmaker and it shows in this dialog. Musings on McDonald's in Europe or the level of intimacy involved in a foot massage become funnier and more fascinating than one would ever think. Characters also stutter, trip over their words, repeat themselves and use poor grammar (not just as in colloquialisms) just as people do in unscripted real life. Yet the film is so well acted and absorbing that we do not even notice these linguistic imperfections without applying very close scrutiny. As an example of the realism of the dialog, take the famous scene (indeed, one of many famous scenes in the film) in which Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) has overdosed on heroin and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) has taken her to his drug dealer's house for help. The plan is to give her a shot of adrenaline directly to her heart (not a sound strategy according to any literature I've read; you would think they'd have some naloxone on hand for this purpose, but I digress). Vincent needs to make a mark over Mia's heart so that he can stab a needle into it:Vincent: What I need is a big fat magic marker (pause) You got it? Jody: (after a pause) What? Vincent: A magic marker... (annoyed, desperate) A felt pen, a (expletive)ing black magic marker!I find this very funny because it is like one of those situations in everyday life where people misunderstand each other because they have different words for things, or they mishear. Of course, in an emergency situation like this one, tempers would obviously flare. All of Tarantino's films have excellent dialog, but what really sets Pulp Fiction above the rest are the themes of redemption/salvation and the character arc of Jules Winnfield (Samual L. Jackson). The partner of Vincent Vega, Jules is a bible quoting, murderous hit-man. Jules and Vincent sadistically kill a room full of young men to reacquire the mysterious briefcase, belonging to their boss. In finishing this job, however, they escape death themselves only by an extraordinarily unlikely occurrence. Jules believes a miracle has occurred, but Vincent dismisses it as chance. They debate the implications of what has happened first at the site and later at the restaurant that is the site of the first and last scenes of the film. As they debate, the camera cuts back and forth between them, showing them in opposite profiles and highlighting their opposite world-views. In a ""moment of clarity"" Jules decides to give up crime and ""walk the earth."" Vincent is skeptical, but Jules shows he is serious by going out of his way to save the lives of the two more amateurish robbers that attempt to steal the briefcase. Likewise, in one of the other story lines we see Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) risk his own life to save another human being (who only hours before was trying to kill him) from torture. It is these examples of morality from the immoral and of karma working its fatal purpose that make this an often inspiring film. Finally, I have to wonder whether Tarantino even knew how great a film he was making. Pulp Fiction is a tribute to the lurid, disposable so-called 'low' art of the mid 20th Century - poorly dubbed Asian crime films, sci-fi magazines and detective stories, etc. Who would have thought that one of the century's last great works of art would have arisen from such material? Perhaps a microcosm of this is the manner in which Jules is a connoisseur of fast-food hamburgers, finding beauty and delectability in the most mundane and disposable of culinary indulgences. This film is indeed, a very tasty burger."

12 April 2006,BrohmaBull007,0,2,9,The Movie is Great,"This was a very nice film. I got this movie expecting to be confused and perplexed at some of the flashbacks but they made sense. This movie will leave you confused so feel free to rewind and re-watch scenes you don't get. I'll start with the fact that the actors were all superb. Samuel Jackson delivered lines whether they were taken out of books or just very genius. Travolta had great screen presence and I liked how laid back and cool he looked on screen. The hair-dos and don't's were all fun and sometimes you could laugh at some of them. Uma Thurman does a surprisingly great job as Mia and Bruce Willis did his role right as well. This movie surprisingly has a lot of humor from the funny exchanges between Jules (Jackson) and Vincent (Travolta) or if you can notice the cheekiness of Mia Wallace (Thurman). This film was well constructed mainly because there weren't any plot holes in it. Watching the first 2 hours will leave you a bit confused. Tarantino must have thought this as well so he goes back and fills in all the holes and gaps such as the retouching the pre-credit sequence so it has more meaning. There are some disturbing sexual content scenes in this movie that will leave you a bit disgusted (fast forward). Travolta and Thurman had good chemistry as well as Travolta/Jackson because they just were all laid back and cool. When it came time for Jackson and Travolta to get tough (since they are hit-man) they do it with vengeance. This movie has a happy ending that will leave you satisfied after this lengthy movie. Length definitely helped this movie out as it covered every aspect such as walking from a car and going inside an apartment. Nothing was rushed here and Tarantino made sure everything tied together despite having slightly different story lines. This movie has action, drama, romance, and crime all sewn in nicely to make sense. This movie does deserve its top 10 spot and it isn't over-hyped. This is a classic film that fans of Tarantino or his books will enjoy. In the end of it all I was satisfied."

                        ",Great cinematic experience,"Pulp Fiction deserves much of the praise that it has been getting, and showed that dialogue alone could make a movie incredibly enjoyable. This movie is filled with terrific conversations between the characters that makes it such a delight to listen to. It isn't flawless though- I felt that entire sequence with Bruce Willis, was way too long, and bordering on the line of boring. But the last 30 minutes or so of the movie is perhaps the best 30 minutes of cinema anyone can ever experience. Starting from the scene in the car where Vincent's little 'accident' occurs, all the way to Jimmy's place and the last scene in the diner is absolutely riveting and most enjoyable to watch. The cast is just amazing, and although I thought Samuel L. Jackson was simply the best, I also really liked Quentin Tarantino's little role- he was wonderfully irritating as Jimmy. The people against all the drugs, violence and profanity should just stop whining- I mean, the movie isn't encouraging this type of behaviour, and besides, they are a bunch of gangsters, so what else would you expect?"
19 November 1998,up2u,0,0,10,Really good,"A genuinely original thriller that seems to tap into our psyche and knows how we talk. All the situations seem real enough. The acting is great (Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman, in particular) but the movie seems to have no point. If you want to see a GREAT movie on the same subject, see Fargo. It probes deeper into morality and desperation and is also a lot funnier."
3 September 1999,Budd-5,0,0,8,Deja-vu,"Quentin Tarantino's movie copied from so many films and has been copied so much since that when I eventually got around to watching it I felt like I had seen it before. That didn't stop me from enjoying it though.Pulp Fiction weaves three character-related stories together. Each story is fairly unremarkable and couldn't sustain a feature but it's the fabulous dialogue and the actors delivery that makes it entertaining.
John Travolta is great as Vincent Vega. He gets to play a large part in the first and final stories and has a cameo in the second. He oozes class as Samuel L Jackson's partner and delivers his lines like their his own words. Bruce Willis proves to be more than just an action hero with a less explosive but still vest wearing part. Uma Thurman pulls off a small but impressive performance. Harvey Keitel and Eric Stoltz have the best cameo roles and Quentin Tarantino isn't bad as Jimmy.But this film belongs to Jackson. He lights up the screen whether he's quoting from the Bible or eating a hamburger. He was born for his part. The three stories should have been all about him.There isn't much more to be said. We all know Quentin Tarantino can write (True Romance) and we know he can direct (Reservoir Dogs). Let's hope there's a few more characters still lurking in that sick head of his."
2 March 2003,a-mar,1,2,8,A must see - once,"I loved this movie on the first viewing.  Laughed unbelievably hard. Repeated some of the cooler lines walking out.  Told everyone up and down how great it was.  Decided it was my favorite movie ever.Then a few weeks later I went back to the theatre and saw it again.  Not as impressive.  Sure, it was still good, but not nearly *as* good.  I rather regretted having seen it a second time - and that's not a feeling you want to have for your favorite movie.As I've thought about this over the years, and seen it again with the same lacking amazement, I've theorized why it fell so quickly for me.  A lot of the movie's appeal is shock value.  The whole design is laid out so you can't see what's coming, and all the characters are created so you don't know what they'll do next.  That's the amazing, entertaining thing about this movie.  And it's what repeat viewers will miss.I wish I could forget it all so I could experience this great film for the first time again, but I can't.  However, if you've gotten through life so far without having seen this movie, you really owe it to yourself to go rent it.  I only gave the movie an '8' here, but I truly think it's a '10' for a first-time viewer."
17 October 2003,CueTee,1,2,9,Without doubt the film that shook up Hollywood....,"I remember all to well, entering the cinema with friends, expecting something special.  A massive fan of RD, and having read reviews of excellence, PF had a lot to live up to.  All I can say is that it blew my mind.  Without doubt the most memorable soundtrack ever and direction that no one other than Tarantino could or would have tried.  The film is weaved together around three stories and with machine precision, link as one at the pinnacle and finale of the picture.  There is no star.  Each performance could not be bettered.  Travolta and Jackson may have the most minutes on screen but Keitel, de Medeiros, Walken, Thurman...... all provide special performances.  The picture gives us questions to take away that will never be answered (what's in the case?).  There are also so many indirect references from other films.  My favourite is Willis as the boxer calling out ""Fabienne"" in an amazingly similar way to Stallone as Rocky, bawling ""Adrienne"".Quentin.  I salute you.

28 April 2022,myersk-59760,2,3,10,"Hands down, top tier Tarantino.","This film has been picked over by critics, film students and general enthusiasts of the cinema since it's premier in October of 1994 and there's always so much to say about it. It remains one of the most off the wall, cult style films with such genuine and unforgettable personality.The premise of the movie spans a course of two days, which in reality feels more like a week and involve a hardy cast of characters, more notably the main characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel Jackson) Marsellus Wallace and Mia Wallace (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). A series of crimes that intertwine the fates and connects all of these characters, has the flow of the film sending you back and forth through time in order to understand their involvement with each other. This gives the editing of the film such an original feel that has defined Director Quentin Tarantino's style as a filmmaker and given him such a massive following.The theme of the film is certainly crime and how it almost never pays, at least not for you. All of these characters find themselves on a crossroad of sorts, having to make drastic decisions that center around their involvement in criminal activities, whether it be robbing some college students or disposing of a body. Some take the higher road and find their salvation, while others fade out without ever taking the chance. The tone has an element of silliness to it but ultimately keeps its serious tone about gangsters doing gangster things.The dialog and writing as a whole remain this film's greatest strength as it allows the characters to become so much more believable and charismatic. Tarantino has always had an extraordinary talent for dialog and the voice he gives his characters, which you will see in any of his films (I recommend Kill Bill for this reason). The quotability of Pulp fiction is something else that any cinema fan has certainly noticed as the film has some of the more memorable lines from any of Tarantino's pictures up to that point. Being so entertained simply by spoken words is a solid sign of talented writing, a talent which Tarantino does not lack.The tone and style of Pulp fiction would inspire so many low budget and or indie films to come as well as a number of feature films, though it holds a specifically special place in cult film culture. This film will certainly remain a classic for any movie lover and a special film to share with newfound movie buffs."
24 September 2001,slam_tilt,1,2,10,The Best film of the 90's by far!,"Forget about Shawshank & Titanic.  Pulp Fiction is the best movie ever made in the 1990's.  It has it all from a great script, ensemble cast that is literally an A-list movie, thrills, drama, comedy and plot twists.  Then put it all together with some avante garde editing and it don't get much better than that baby. It basically rates up there with Star Wars: Episode 4 as the best movies ever made."

28 July 2021,Swolzee,2,4,6,Good but not great,"Certainly worth a watch, but this movie didn't reinvent the wheel like a lot of fans would have you believe. Like most Tarantino films it's self indulgent to the point that it divides viewers into camps of those who think it's genius, and those who remembered they had some paint drying somewhere they needed to check on.Oddly enough I fall into the camp that's somewhere in-between with this title."
19 June 2022,sangramchowdhury,2,3,10,Great Movie & Oscar Winning Masterpiece,"What a film. Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few."
3 January 2005,Movieman02,1,3,10,This Could Be The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"I think that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is not just a great movie, but quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. It has everything that a movie-goer would love to see in a movie. A great script full of plenty of gross-out moments, shocking moments, humor, great lines, and parts that make a watcher think. The film does not treat the audience like a moron like so many recent films have the tendency to do. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and you have to have an IQ that is larger than your shoe size to fully understand it.Tarantino also use time as a plot driving device in the most effective way I have ever seen put to film. I guess you could say that the film is in ""flashback"" form, but the characters and the plot that you see in those ""flashbacks"" make you forget that it has already happened! Along with the monster performances that Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman put on the table (not to mention the small, well acted part Quentin Tarantino did himself) makes this movie a 5 out of 4 star movie and an instant classic. Enjoy, it comes highly recommended by yours truly,Movieman02"

11 May 2015,IowaJammer,0,1,10,"I Love You, Honey Bunny.","There is zero debate that this film is the greatest film ever created. If there were a debate, I'd pay full admission to hear Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield have it. Pulp Fiction is what any film lover should consider to be a contemporary classic. Quentin Tarantino does everything right in this 1994 Classic. Sure Pulp Fiction is violent; sure it's full of swearing, and a mild case of Bruce Willis genitals yet that mean it shouldn't be shown in every school across America, this film is an American treasure!In all seriousness, this is a great film. It's not often a film can end with the beginning and have you walking out completely unsure of what temporal space any of the scenes witnessed came from, yet still able to follow along the entire time. Tarantino does the imaginable by creating taking 3.5 short stories and editing them together so perfectly while putting the focus entirely on the dialog. It really didn't matter what happened in this movie so long as the characters were talking. Visually the film stands up as well today as it did twenty years ago, which is simply the cherry on top of this ice cream Sunday. Not enough good things can be said about this pop culture icon. The piece of the film that might be the most unsung hero is the music. Most film buffs will be quick to point out ""Miserlou"" as being one of the best film theme songs ever, yet I've yet to here a casual viewer speak in awe of the great musical accompaniment.Pulp Fiction. Go Watch It."

11 February 2006,Cloud20,0,2,10,One of the Best to Come out of the 90's Decade.,"Pulp Fiction (1994)John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel, Maria De Medeiros, Eric Stolz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken.'Pulp Fiction' is the thrill-ride of cinema . It is like watching a real life comic book on the big screen. It's wild, chaotic, fun, entertaining, and thrilling from beginning to end as it is told from different segments.The plot of about redemption. Jules and Vincent are two hit men who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. Ringo and Honey Bunny are two bandits who plan to rob a diner. Wallace's wife, Mia, goes out with Vincent and unfortunately has an overuse of drugs. Butch Coolidge is a boxer who is out of luck and ditches a fight with Marsellus' money filled in his pockets, and plans to escape with the money.All of the stories are divided into different segments told at different times. Quentin Tarantino had his directorial debut with 1992' 'Reservoir Dogs', and wrote Tony Scott's 'True Romance'. Here, he writes and directs 'Pulp Fiction' with everything he's got, and it never fails. Ever.Everything about this film is absolutely nothing that you would expect from a mob film, which is exactly one of the reasons that it succeeds. The dialog is classic to say the least, in which it should be required for movie-goer to read that script, and definitely see the movie.There is one very talked about and mysterious scene, when Vincent opens the briefcase. No one knows what is in it, at least no fans of the movie. Many people take guesses but at times are never close. Quentin does this to make us think in our own minds of what it is. Some say that it is the jewels from 'Reservoir Dogs' but some go as far as to say that it is Marsellus' soul (Briefcase case code: 666; The band-aid on his neck is supposed to cover the ""thorn"" sign). It's highly doubtful in my opinion, but it is one again thought-provoking and interesting.The dialog is great. The film never runs on empty for the script or even the characters. The characters all have lines at some point, and each of them are successful, whereas in 'Reservoir Dogs' the pace did drag a bit during the background character development. Here's an example of the dialog in the film:Vincent: You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? Jules: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese? Vincent: No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what a Quarter Pounder is. Jules: What do they call it? Vincent: They call it a ""Royale"" with cheese. Jules: A Royale with cheese. What do they call a Big Mac? Vincent: Well, a Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it ""Le"" Big Mac. Jules: ""Le Big-Mac"". (Laughs) What do they call a Whopper? Vincent: I don't know, I didn't go into Burger King.The dialog is very comically funny in some of the scenes, and at the same time is suspenseful in some ways. Tarantino's direction is fabulous, as was his in his debut. Both this is something different. In his first film, it seemed much more independent and there was much controversy of the style from 'Reservoir Dogs'. Here, his style is much more clear and the writing makes it succeed more than any other indie film I've ever seen.The cast is great, once again. Samuel L. Jackson gives one of his best, if not the best, performances of his career. Travolta, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Roth, and Keitel give very memorable performances and quotes. Also, Christopher Walken gives a great comic cameo. Each segment tells most about one of the main characters. You get to know each of them one-by-one. In the end, you don't really know which character to root for, because you like all of them.One of the most controversial things about this film that came across the critics was it's violence and excessive language. Now that I have seen Tarantino's latest film, 'Kill Bill', I now think that 'Pulp Fiction' isn't nearly as violent as many people would think nowadays. The language is heavily used, but Tarantino blends it in with the script very easily that it isn't really much of a problem.'Pulp Fiction' has gotten many excellent reviews and great ratings from fans and critics alike. It is definitely a fan that no movie-goer can't miss out on, and Tarantino proves to be one of my favorite directors ever, along on the list with Hitchcock, Kubrick, Scorsese, and Spielberg. This is easily the best of Quentin's career, and a landmark for films to come. 5 stars out of 5."
2 April 2018,alexandregatineau,0,0,10,Just watch it,"The dialogues, the silences, the music, the CAST, the shots, this is how you make a movie. 
Having watched every Tarantino films, I still don't know how he can make dialogue scenes so captivating. This is a 1994 masterpiece and it doesn't even deserve my review, there's tons of good reviews out there, go watch it."
30 December 2011,vivek08019,1,2,10,Quentin Tarantino definer of film making.,"It's the screenplay that runs a movie at the end. However prolific may be the story, it's the screen script that makes or breaks a movie. It applies other way too. The necessity for a movie is just screenplay and nothing else. Quentin Tarantino is the man if you agree the lines i said above. He is the master of characterization and intriguing screenplay. At times, we feel fallen out of lengthy dialogues, but it just happens to the opposite with Tarantino. You would love to trade anything for a few extra verbose outbursts from Winnfield.The blood, the boldness, the script, the pace, the magnificence. this is pure film making. And, nothing is compromised. Many wonder if this movie is overrated. I guess it's about time we changed. This has all the elements for a blockbuster all time hit, it never goes out of style. It's unfortunate it came out in the gold age of American cinema- the 1990s. Nonetheless, it's the crown of English cinema and will always be."
5 January 2000,GregRG,0,0,10,A film of boundless invention and energy,"Far too few films are actually alive.  They have stories and dialogue, to be sure, but you don't get the feeling that anybody is actually thinking or feeling.  Pulp Fiction is the antidote to those films.  It is one of the most unique films ever made, and it is brimming with fascinating dialogue, with original humor, with energy, and with life.  Writer/director Quentin Tarantino has made a masterpiece of dialogue, tone, and setting.  Like the characters, we have to be on our toes to appreciate the richness of the story.  Time lines and story lines intersect with sex, drugs, violence, and humor in ways that we don't fully understand until long past the credits role.  This film also stays with us long after the credits role, appreciating its audacity, intelligence, and Tarantino's boundless energy."
28 November 2009,domarulz,1,2,10,an unusual take on the lives of two hit men told subtly in chapters which touch upon their unusual experiences,"i hadn't seen any Tarantino movie before pulp fiction but this one totally blew me away. a truly unique style of film making coupled with some brilliant performances. what's most remarkable is that all the parts fit together so well, you almost get a feeling of ""eureka"". plus the music of pulp fiction is its biggest strength, going so well with what's playing on screen its almost as if you're witnessing the scene in first person. there's great chemistry between the lead actors(travolta and Jackson), excellent camera-work, and a lot of minor details that caught my attention only in a second viewing.the banter between the characters feels so real, at times you forget you're watching a movie. pulp fiction is not just a film, its an experience; a lesson in the art of film making. Tarantino captures every emotion of his characters so well, you develop a closeness with them and of course a liking for them. in the end its about projecting the realities of life in a fashionable, relatable way. and this Tarantino does with grace and control."

                        ",Indebted to Jean-Luc!,"Just a couple of points. In the 1950s and 60s, French 'nouvelle vague' (new wave) directors, such as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, made films based on the American pulp crime tradition, filtered through European notions of art cinema. But you knew that, right? Thing 'Breathless' and 'Shoot the Pianist'. An, of course, 'Bande a Part', after which Tarantino named his production company. So essentially 'Pulp Fiction' is American crime re-interpreted in the light of the French interpretation of it in the 60s. It contains several references to Godard, most notably the dancing scene (Tarantino is on record as saying this was directly inspired by 'Bande a Part'). And The Wolf's arrival in 9 minutes and 37 seconds refers to the scene in the same film in which the characters run through the louvre in record time. The moment when Mia tells Vincent not to be square and a square appears on the screen is also pure Godard. So basically, this is an all American film that could not have been made without the high priest of European arthouse cinema. Which you could see as fairly ironic, and something that gets missed very easily by US critics."
6 February 2003,fateswarm,1,3,10,Ah.. what to say first,"What to say first, for a movie that has changed the way I see the 7th art.It was 1994 when my parents went home from the premiere our home town's municipality has made. ""Don't watch this sick film"", said my mother. ""yes, listen to your mother and don't watch this sick film"", my father agreed.As a typical 17 year old, this was the best thing they could do to make me watch it. I still act like that, but at that age, it was just the thing.Well, and and it blew me away. I won't be lieing, the extreme scenes of sodomy and killings that are on this film it's not what makes me like it.In the contrary, that scenes is exactly not the point. The point is the de-synced plot and the excellent performances, lines and pictures, on a movie that reached so many people.It was not the first time, a movie was violent. It was not the first time, a movie had excellent performances, music, direction or even de-synced timing on the plot.But it was the first time a movie took all these elements and made,a masterpiece."
17 February 2002,seanahalpin,0,1,10,Gritty and absorbing,"I first saw this film on video knowing nothing about it other than it had been a blockbuster at the movies a year or two earlier. From the moment it came on, I was absolutely glued to the television.Stunning rather than enjoyable, it is a collection of images, characters and situations that (thank god) are far removed from the everyday life of the suburbanite. Humorous and horrific, it is hypnotic, and as the art critic viewing Kramer's portrait in Seinfeld exclaims, it is ""hideous! And yet I cannot look away!""Jackie Brown, another Tarantino film followed similar characters in a less violent way, and may be the better choice for those wanting less gore. Both films are excellent depictions of how the 'other side' live.(The only thing that I didn't like about the film was the Tarantino cameo. Why does he think that just because he is a brilliant film maker, he is also a brilliant actor? His scenes always seem too stilted for my liking).This film is a must-see for anyone who counts themselves as a genuine movie buff."
15 May 2013,hillfingerh,1,2,10,Un Predictable Amazing Film,"Un Predictable Amazing Film. That is the only word to express this whole movie. It is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown. For example when Trabolta (not sure with his name's spelling) carries Uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug, multitude of people would think that Uma would die and Trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what? They success saving Uma. And did Uma told the boss whole this? Nope, she kept her mouth shut. Did this scene affect the story? Not at all, everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie. It was just the part of beginning. But the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small story's elements are totally unpredictable. How is this possible? 'cause it is Tarantino's film! No respect for girls violence no respect for view's visual, he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors can't have, that's the power of the bravery. YOU BETTER WATCH THIS AWESOME FILM AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!"
19 July 2013,OrdinaryDay,0,0,10,"Shameless rehash of old noir stories or brilliant homage to them? both, neither and everything in between.","Tarantino is an enigma, and most people seem to either love him or hate him: there is no middle ground. Is he a brilliant, prodigious writer and director who meticulously takes the essence of the hard-boiled crime and detective stories that inspired him growing up and takes their heart and soul and re appropriates it into a story for the modern audience? Is he a shameless hack who simply steals from old movies and takes credit for them, trying to claim that these old stories are his 'original ideas'? The thing is, depending on who you ask you will get a different answer. Some say yes, some say no, but the thing is that everyone has an opinion! Because when you see a work of art such as this, forgetting about any possible derivatives within the story, it is impossible to look away. Always riveting, bloody, scary and most of all very funny, with Pulp Fiction Tarantino managed to take time-worn stories that had been done hundreds of times before and since and give it a distinctive Tarantino flavor.What kinds of hit men discuss Cheeseburgers while going to and from their latest hit? The ones in Pulp Fiction do! And therein lies the brilliance of this movie, as Tarantino made everything that was old seem fresh again, through his distinctive auteur style, narrative that goes back and forth in time, the juxtaposition between street smart cheeky dialog and the horrific actions of the characters and the weird morals within the narrative, which presents bad guys as funny and sexy.Perhaps the myths surrounding Pulp Fiction do an injustice to the movie itself, because so much has been written on the movie, it has been critiqued so many thousands of times, that watching the movie with the weight of all those expectations can seem a little underwhelming. After all, it probably won't change your life, or inspire in you a life long love for hardboiled noir stories or anything like that.Pulp Fiction exceeds in something so much more simple, and yet something that so many other filmmakers forget to do: it succeeds in being a brilliant piece of entertainment that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration. And when you get down to it, I think being a piece of brilliant entertainment is much better than being a piece of film history. But what makes Pulp Fiction so special is that it is both."
14 June 2008,gerhajdu,1,3,6,Truly great movie if you watch close,"I never understand what made this movie a top one. I was never into this gangster, mafia, drugs'n'pistols world. Pulp Fiction is surely remarkable and I must say I liked it. Most of the dialogs were hilarious, I was surprised at myself enjoying the whole movie. Any disgusting it was I had to laugh hard at the corpse-cleaning scene. Or when Travolta is talking to himself in the mirror. All these things are usually disgusting to me, some are hard to talk about but when Tarantino makes it funny or brings depth to it, I feel he did something great. I also liked that Tarantino makes an opportunity to show the actor's abilities. How much time and retry it must take to film that 60 second-long scene- in one shot? How much this director added to the actor's performance? I definitely enjoyed Pulp Fiction but I couldn't agree it is a cult-classic. Maybe something misses. I don't know. There movies much closer to my heart."
11 January 2006,jordman10,0,2,10,Most Likely One of the Best Movie of all Time,Okay This Movie is Boss. In My Opinion Quentin Tarantino is a Frickin' Genius. Of course there's the retarded stereotype that all Tarantino movies are just sex language and graphic brutal violence which just purely isn't true. His characters have depth and he has a brilliant story and Tarantino is probably *THE* best screenplay writer who has ever lived. Not a family movie. But a TRUE MOVIE MASTERPIECE!! I truly recommend this movie to anyone who likes difficult story lines to figure out. Also people who love a Brilliant screenplay. And if your choose to ignore the story line it alternates as kind of a gore flick. Sheer Brilliance This Is at the top list of my most definite all time favorite movies of all time. Tarantino I worship you at your feet for bringing such a work of art to the world.
25 May 2004,lastamericanliberal,1,2,9,What can ya say?,"Simply one of the best films of the last twenty years. It was the best Crime-film since Godfather, (Notice: Attempt at Sacrilege is neigh) surpassing Goodfellas. His absolute best piece of work, and any who argues otherwise is simply tainting their own opinion to juxtapose the common mandate. Or, they actually differ. One or the other. Anyway, Quentin succeeds at making Cult mainstream, without turning people into Sci-Fi Geeks (Star Wars, Lord Of the Rings, Harry Potter, et al) or selling out his own vision. He is a film maker of unmatched vision, and the dialogue in this film is beyond reproach. When I went to see it in the theatre the first time (I was like, 10 years old) I was on the look out for any subtle references or subliminal hints. About ten minutes into it I was so rapped up in Vincent and Jules' conversation that I started craving a Royale' with Cheese. Dig this flick the most."

9 August 2004,maxx-denton12,1,2,10,Definition of Cool,"If you go over to your dictionary and look up the word cool, you'll likely find Pulp Fiction the definition for it along with a picture of Quentin Tarantino next to it. When the credits hit the screen at the end of this movie a certain feeling rises in my throat. Unlike some other of my favorite movies, where I look at the world around me differently for a few hours, at the end of Pulp Fiction I'm simply struck by a feeling of ""Whoa, that was cool."" This movie could be called genius and I would agree. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and this was the first movie of his I saw and I have to admit that almost at first when I was watching it I felt that sort of ADD that I feel if I'm watching an okay movie. I was squirming around until the first shot was fired and then I sat for the next hour or so and was stunned. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST go out right now to your local video store and rent Pulp Fiction. It will change you, and you may find that you have a new favorite movie."
19 May 2005,remy-24,1,2,10,"Great dialogue, great acting, great cinematography...just great!","First up: I haven't seen all of Tarantino's work, so comparison with other movies directed by him will be nowhere to be seen in this comment. Secondly, I've recently seen Pulp Fiction for probably the third or fourth time, which is (for me) the necessary amount of times needed to fully be able to value it correctly.Harvey Keitel as the Wolf, Ving Rhames as Mr Wallace, Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, they all make a great cast. Not only the acting in itself is great, but also the chemistry between the characters and their surroundings and situations simply works and works very well. Simply put: they (the actors) couldn't have done a better job.The storyline is split up in bits and pieces and come together in the end like a bit of tape being stitched together. The pace is never slow, even when there are long dialogues: the dialogues actually make the movie go up a level! Lots of stuff going on: drugs, crime, death, coincidence, religious stuff, sex, and so on. This movie is definitely not for the faint hearted.In terms of the music and cinematography, this is the next bonus: an excellent soundtrack being put to good use during the various 'move on' scenes or to get a certain atmosphere during a scene. It's not just loose bits, it's all a fast food package: heavy on the tummy but tasty to eat.All in all a great movie, and yes, the first (and so far I believe the only one) that gets a 10 out of 10 from me here on IMDb. Must see. Definitely."

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction was one of the greatest films of last century; Tarantino intertwines the story six main characters in an original tale of redemption. The iconic opening conversation about what they call fast-food abroad, between the two mob men, Vincent and Jules, sets a trend of witty dialogue and black comedy throughout the film. Vince (Travolta) seems to be the most thuggish of the pair who clearly enjoys his brutal job, where as Jules (Samuel Jackson) comes across as the more virtuous, spitting out memorable biblical quotes throughout the film. The layered masterpiece must be watched again and again to enjoy its full potential. With a simple yet uniquely assembled plot this film plays host to a string of great characters that will never be beaten, nor will there ever be a film quite like it."

It is absolutely amazing (and not to mention fun) to watch how these characters grow on you, and how you can root for the bad guys. This is the best movie that Uma Thurman, Samuel L.

My favorite character has to be Samuel L Jackson, as Jules, he is so cool, and hilarious, I also think he had the best lines, and acted them out perfectly.

This is evidenced by the recent string of posts on the Pulp Fiction board entitled ""500 Things You've Noticed About Pulp Fiction."" Not too many movies have so many things going for it.This is truly a movie that defined a generation. After Pulp, a string of films came out that attempted to recapture the magic of Pulp: 2 Days in the Valley, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Go., and many more. Each of these movies had something going for it; but each movie seemed to only bring to the table one of the many elements that made pulp so rich, whether it be the non-linear storytelling, witty dialogue with pop-culture reference, hipper-than-thou characters, or absurd, out-of-nowhere plot twists.

He has never made a movie (to my knowledge) the he did not either have a supporting role or a cameo. ""From Dusk 'till Dawn"" he made a brilliant move with Cheech playing three roles. As 'Jimmy' he was an actor of the highest caliber. Brought back Travolta for a mere $450,000, a STEAL but a good business move. Quentin wrote the storyline to ""Natural Born Killers"" just before he wrote the screenplay of Pulp Fiction. Convinced Producers to give him an $8 million budget, that returned over $100,000,000 in North America and when you count world-wide it doubles. I think Kill Bill Vol. 3 is going to be very good."

When I got halfway through it, I found myself staring at the ceiling, wondering why it is so important to listen to people discuss pot bellies and the french way to say quarter pounder. I think there were some good scenes and some great one-liners, but the movie could have been at least 45 minutes shorter and had a story line that at least made a little bit of sense before you have to sit through it again just to piece together story. Overall, the idea for the story is OK, but the execution was off.

I went into it halfway expecting not to like it, and I came out a rabid fan.  Samuel L. Jackson is the finest actor in film today, and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map.  Not to mention jump-starting the career of John Travolta! Sure, there's lots of violence and profanity--but that's what makes the movie!  I'm not one of those die-hard Tarantino fans either.

Everything from the costumes the sets, make up, hair, acting, writing, directing and editing. All the best of the best. Amazing work! PulpFiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plot wise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the scenes I really like were with Uma Thurman. I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' ""top 10""."
20 January 2018,walkerus,0,0,10,Pure and Simple....... 'Entertainment',"Movies don't have to have a 'Breathless Message' for the ages. Movies don't have to follow any pattern or pre-determined plan. Movies are not a mirror of real life or subliminal religious afterthought. Movies. like Fiction found in Books. are just for ENTERTAINMENT!...... Most people live a fairly orderly life, working, bringing up a family, putting up with illnesses, normal family problems, financial constraints etc. the Movies are the ordinary persons chance to float off into a make-believe world for a little while and be a part of something magical called pictured-imagination. Pulp Fiction is a movie that entertains, it throws in the mix ideas and situations that are far away from the normal life of the population, then it stirs them all together and into this maelstrom of situations we leave the present behind and for a little while we are 'Entertained'........ in that, this movie succeeds!"

They had all the different stories of the people and it was very cool. The best one was when John Travolta accidentally ""shot Marvin in the head"" and Samuel Jackson had brains in his hair. This movie was very good and was actually pretty funny at parts. Just be ready for a gross part(unfortunately I wasn't). Better the Reservoir Dogs."
14 December 2014,Emillion,0,1,9,"""English mother f***er, do you speak it ?!""","One of my favorite films of all time however my opinion is bias because I love Quentin Tarrantino. The film is set up in chapters much with an out of order story line thats very interesting to following. It is a dark humor so it's not for everyone. The acting is phenomenal, Samuel L Jackson is hilarious and Uma Thurman is spectacular. The Score was very beautifully made and the cinematography was spectacular. Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you didn't know you wanted to see until you actually sit down and watch it. The plot is very unique and interesting. Overall a great movie, one of Tarrantino's best films and one of my favorites."

                        ",review,"Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that you always hear about but maybe have never seen. This movie is so different and interesting, director Quentin Tarantino really made a breakthrough film with this one. the camera angles were a really big appeal to me when watching this movie. The over the shoulder shots, as well as camera shots that were point of view shots, were very interesting. The camera was often angled down low and tilted slightly in many scenes which added a cool twist to the average eye level filming we see. The diverse cast of so many well known actors worked so well together to create a film as interesting and different as this one."
13 May 2015,joedebritz,0,1,7,Story of Confusion,"This is an excellent film and one of Tarentino's best. It has a powerful feeling to it that really captures you. This is one the most original movies I have ever seen. It is not told in chronological order at all, and therefore leaves you guessing on what is going to happen. The acting in this film is very well done, Travolta, Jackson, and Willis make a great combination of the rag tag criminals that make up this film. The thing about this film that really stands out is the cinematography and the editing. There are some very original shots in this movie that make it hard to turn away from. I recommend this film to anyone."

28 June 2000,sal_ruggiero,0,0,9,A genius at his best,"Saying that ""Pulp Fiction"" is a masterpiece is an understatement. It is an awesome movie that is just genius by how everything fits together.First, the casting was awesome. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurmon (my personal favourite), Harvey Keitel, and Bruce Willis light up the screen with electrifying performances.Tarantino's use of hit men, a last chance prizefighter, the boss's sexy wife and two young people wanting to rob restaurants fits together so perfectly that it deserved to be BEST PICTURE over ""Forrest Gump"" because Gump had boring scenes, while ""Pulp Fiction"" keeps you entertained from the beginning restaurant scene and the ending restaurant scene, which both actually are the same scene.""Pulp Fiction"" is great because it can be classified in so many categories. It is a comedy, drama, action, adventure...Two characters that are worth mentioning are Uma Thurmon and Samuel L. Jackson. Uma Thurmon who plays Mia Wallace is excellent as a cocaine addicted druggie. She's in the picture for not even half the time, but ""VINCENT VEGA & MARCELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"" is my favourite story of ""Pulp Fiction."" Samuel L. Jackson who plays Jules is a focal point of the story. With his Ezekial 25:17 deal and his ending performance, Jackson deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.The soundtrack is great because it reminds you about the fun the winner of Palme D'Or of the Cannes Film Festival really was. ""Pulp Fiction"" is an awesome experience that deserves the great critical acclaim it has received."

23 May 1999,scarface-19,1,2,10,The Greatest Film Ever!,"A brilliant look at honor among criminals in L.A.  It's the film that everyone has been waiting for, but took everyone by surprise.  If there ever was a film to watch, this is the one. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give head turning performances , and so does Uma Thurman. This film has a nostalgic feel to it.  It feels like this film was made sometime in the 1970's, but it was made in 1994. Note: I never understood why everyone that sees this film (except for me) says that it has nudity.  The people at Cinebooks need to get glasses."
10 August 2001,mmintz,0,1,10,"Butch, do I have a pot?","My ex-girlfriend refuses to watch this one and she'll probably still live a fulfilled life.  But for those of us who can never regain our innocence, you have to admit this is one hell of a movie.  Some of the sharpest, funniest dialogue ever written.  Yes, a bit contrived at times (some times Tarantino sounds like he's trying to sound like Tarantino) but still stunning.  The verbal sparring is every bit as exciting and violent as the blood and bullets and little bits of brain.  Interesting Postmodern take on spirituality.  Camus would've been proud.  Even if Jules' conversion was based on the possibly incorrect assumption that God had directly intervened in his life, Postmodernism says, ""Hey, what they hell?  Go for it.  It's not any more or less true than anything else so more power to you.  Praise be to God!""  Interesting.  Tarantino is sometimes criticized for being too clever with his influences and allusions but I don't think that's true of PULP FICTION.  Yes we can see shades of Kiss Me Deadly, Deliverance, etc. but I don't think they take over the movie.  Also, the music works (in the movie but not, in my opinion, on the soundtrack CD).  Tarantino was once asked if he had intentionally put songs like ""Jungle Boogie"" in with the intent to be campy but Q said that basically he didn't care what was considered corny and what was considered art.  He just knew he liked it.  Probably gives us a little insight into his view of movie making too."

7 May 2014,t-seeberger4,0,2,7,Analysis for Pulp Fiction (1994),"I actually like this film a little more than some other R-rated films, including ""Do the Right Thing"". There are more good scenes that I could watch than other R-rated films. However, like ""Do the Right Thing"", this doesn't touch my heart. One bad thing about this film is that there was a bit of violence that I really don't want to see. In terms of the other parts of this film, they are okay, like the fight scene, but they also have some drawbacks. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is once again some partial nudity. I have never liked seeing some movies that include nudity, starting with ""The Graduate"". But not everything is bad. There are some good parts in this film, including great acting, nice cinematography, and very good lighting effects. The rest of the stuff in the film are like a hit and miss for me. Overall, this is a good film, but it doesn't offer as much comparing to the other films that I reviewed."
13 December 2014,leonrach95,0,1,8,Very cool to see,"This is one of those movies where no matter how well you explain how awesome it is, they will actually just have to see the movie them self. This interesting movie is a complete mix of different time periods combined. The mood and style is so engaging in this movie, and makes you really pay attention to what is actually happening. This movie isn't afraid to bend the rules, and they show that they definitely aren't. The ways the actors work together is impressive. They add on to each of their characters giving each other more life and making themselves pop at the same time. The way the camera and lighting is set up adds on to the effects and mood of the movie, while enhancing it."
27 April 2015,MC_Barton,0,0,9,"""That's thirty minutes away, I'll be there in ten.""","Tarantino delivers a masterpiece with ""Pulp Fiction."" The master of quick- witted dialog doesn't fail to deliver, there is never a moment of boredom within the film. Watching through it just once, it is impossible to understand and grasp just how many references and criticisms there are to and about pop culture. The movie is highly stylized and distinctly carries it's own identity, and I'm not going to give away any plot points because this is a must watch, so I'll be as vague as possible. The movie seemingly has no linear plot structure since it jumps around a lot, and that is an understatement. With that being said, it just is impossible to lose attention from the viewer, but it is possible to get lost in the content, which is why it is more than deserving of multiple watch- throughs."

Travolta and Jackson play hit men who are asked by their boss to go retrieve a very important suitcase. When their boss is out of town, Travolta's character must take out his boss' wife. Unfortunately, their night doesn't go as planned. They run into a boxer (Bruce Willis) who was told by the boss to throw his last fight.

                        ",Tarantino's ascent to the top began with this movie,"Quentin Tarantino burst on the scene with Reservoir Dogs and with Pul Fiction he cemented his place among the most exciting directors to watch. Like every other film of his this one contains memorable scenes, memorable dialogues and characters and an execution which can easily be identified as ""Tarantinoesque"". The film plays non-chronologically and involves two hitmen, a boxer, a mobster's wife and a diner. Each and every actor is amazing, so much so that you cannot imagine anyone else in the role. Travolta is especially good- no wonder this was a resurrection of sorts for the famed actor who was previously known for his dancing numbers. Populated by the Tarantino stock of actors who are seen in his films Pulp Fiction is a very good film that deserves to be seen."

22 May 2011,falloutboy72,1,4,9,Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is one of the most successful movies of the 90's. With Tarantino's breakout film Reservoir Dogs, this young director showed potential. Pulp Fiction was an even better film, and garnered even more respect.It's a movie in which there are seemingly random short stories, but by the end they all tie in. The movie starts off with a random scene in a restaurant that isn't mentioned tell the end, and halfway in between Bruce Willis is on screen, and by the end, you think to yourself that it all made sense.Tarantino really shines in his script and directing style. The script is fast paced and pretty mainstream, but its not dumbed down, like the word mainstream may suggests. It has some pretty amazing and even intellectual lines. The sets look great, there is some great cinematography, like random camera angles at the opposite end of the hall, with the characters on the other end. Things like this makes the movie unique.The acting is great, and the roles were picked perfectly. This is a movie you can not miss, and is entertaining, but has a very great plot too."

Tarantino is a master of storytelling, editing and fun. There's never a lost moment, perfection abounds. Samuel Jackson is unforgettable, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, I mean I don't even know what to say, they're all just wonderful. How can you forget the scene with Christopher Walken? I can't remember any of the acting being bad ever, each character was interesting and fun to watch in his or her own way. The dialogue in the film is funny and slick.

Rarely famous films live up to my expectations, but this one certainly did. Possibly a new favoriteSince I really have nothing to criticize, I will say a few things that I liked the best. Firstly, the lighting and camera and just overall 'look' I am totally in love with. It fits the subject matter so well, and just feels right, and kind of quirky. There's also something special about the vibrancy and colors here too. Some of the camera angles I found rather nice as well: especially the low angle shots, and the close ups on the action. I also think the fragmented plot, and ""unnecessary"" dialogue makes the film what it is. I hear people complaining that it's difficult to understand what's going on in the sequence of events, but even so it's hard to imagine it working any other way. The characters are fabulously written and acted, and the compiled score is inspired."

From the brutally true language, to the masterful screenplay, to the emotional feel of a perfect story, this is one of the best films of all time. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson have some of the best chemistry I have ever seen as two hit men who have a wide range of characteristics. This film is subtly gory which makes it all the more realistic, the half-hour scenes are breathtaking, and the fact that a 160 minute film with no action can be this brilliant, is brilliance in itself. This film shall go down in history with fury!"

I suppose it's meant to be a meditation on the spontaneity of fate.Along the way we get a lot of colourful characters. It's never exactly funny or poignant but it's stylized enough to be worthy of our time and give something for cartoons to parody for years to come.

                        ",Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this film but some of it was drab. The first 30 minutes were not very good at all. The first speeches between Travolta and the other hit man were contrived and rigid. I didn't buy it. But it got better as it went along. It had some stimulating plot twists, especially when Bruce Willis had to decide whether or not to rescue the man who had been out to kill him ten minutes earlier. It reminds me of THE INTERLOPER by Saki, when two bitter enemies were trapped by a fallen tree and became friends, only to be rescued.... by wolves. The part about the gold watch being hidden up a man's certain area for years was supposed to be funny but I thought it was not and it ruined a plot that until then was supposed to be taken seriously. The writer makes an excellent showing as Jimmy who doesn't think his house has a certain sign on it. Bruce Willis was the best actor in this movie and that doesn't say that much for it since he isn't really the new Laurence Olivier. But PULP had some bite and some very good moments. Why don't we all respect each other and stop ripping anyone who doesn't agree with our opinions about movies? Lets stop insisting that anyone who doesn't agree with me is a moron. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, not mine. This isn't the Israel-Palestine dispute. Its movies, for crying out loud."

In fact, it's a combination of everything. The ingredients to this movie were simple: combine one of the greatest screenplays of our time with some of the finest acting from big name stars, and sprinkle in amazing direction from the incredible Quentin Tarantino, and you got one of the best and imaginative movies of the 90s. No, scratch that. Not even the 90s, one of the best and imaginative movies of all time. This movie was a milestone in cinema and though it is for a select crowd, those who are meant to see it will absolutely love it.10/10"
26 July 2002,PopcornAndSoda,1,2,9,Classic Tarentino,"Tarentino does it again, only this time, he created a masterpiece.  Pulp Fiction is a fast paced thrilling ride through the eyes of a wonderful writer/director.  Also, there were Award winning actors such as Travolta and Jackson, who acted superb."
16 February 2000,bleblanc,5,18,4,overrated,"I was instructed that I need to enter in at least four lines for my vote/comment to count.  So, I believe one word sums up Pulp Fiction: OVERRATED.  It's not that it's a bad movie, it's just that everyone needs to wake up and realize there are a ton of movies better than this one."
20 May 2016,JomeJoseph,1,1,10,Amazing !!!!,"One of the best film I've been in a while . This film changed my whole outlook on how good movies are made .It's undeniably one of the most popular and influential films of all time. It's still being shamelessly imitated to this very day, yet Pulp Fiction the film is about nothing,it says nothing and it makes you feel nothing. It has an adolescent aesthetic and some of the dialogue could be from an early draft of Clerks, yet it is just so irresistibly ""cool"". Travolta and Samuel L Jackson in matching black suits; Harvey Keitel as Mr Wolf (now ruined thanks to Direct Line); the dance in the diner; Ving Rhames being mean– all so hip, all so enchanting, but none of it adds up to anything.And that is Tarantino's biggest flaw as a filmmaker. With the exception of the glorious Jackie Brown, all of his movies amount to nothing more than a few good scenes, while the overall narrative gets lost in his indulgence. Pulp Fiction is not a good film, though I may have believed it was in my younger, more impressionable days, when you had to like the film. On each re- watch, it lost a little more of the magic I thought was there the first time I saw it."
2 August 2002,maxey-1,1,2,10,The best,"This film is brilliant. It got 3 stories, violence, swearing and crime. Those 3 words and Quentin Tarantino are lethal commonation. This film is also John Travolta`s comeback and first real role for Samuel L Jackson. Ving Rhames makes excellent role too and Bruce Willis... oh my god how much stars. Harvey Keitel is amazing at wolf who cleans the mess. This film is so brilliant and even i can`t say it all."

                        ",Fabulous fiction...,"One thing that you have to love about ol' Quentin Tarantino is the style he can bring to a film... no matter what's going on or what's being said.As a humble (but by no means obsessed) fan of 'Reservoir Dogs', I was anxious to see how 'Pulp Fiction' would compare to Tarantino's earlier screen success. And for all of the time spent watching it from beginning to end, I was thoroughly loving it. Loving every minute of it. Tarantino has definitely pulled off another successful hit-and-run with this one. The all-star cast is amazing, which includes many outstanding performances from sexy, stoned out Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson as one bad@ss-motherf*cker. And as for John Travolta? He should be down on his hands and knees thanking Quentin for jump-starting his career again with this knock-out role. He wouldn't be flying any planes today were he stuck making the 'Look Who's Talking' movies.Spectacular action sequences, fast-dialogue, witty humor and Bruce Willis taking some trash out with a samurai sword. What more could you ask for?Get's the clowns_n_cookies thumbs up!"
22 February 2018,tedd0093,0,1,8,A famous case of unconventional storytelling,"Being the early successes of Tarantino's work, is something that lasts for a long time - all things considered. The style and and themes of this movie is definitely different from many other gangster-dramas. The theme is very dark and cruel, with long drawn out dialogue that represents some of the worst aspects of human beings. The charming actors holds the movie to such a high standard, that you can't do nothing, but love their long and tedious monologues. The writing is supreme, the actors fit perfectly for the style, the cinematography is okay, and the dark comedy is hilarious. The reason this is not a top class product, is based on the fact that the narrative seems disjointed from having solid plot-structure, and therefore seems like the events are just randomly connected without a deeper meaning. With that said! the movie is great anyway."
30 October 2014,striingz,1,1,10,Love this movie!,"I'm writing this purely for being able to cross it off my profile checklist that I haven't done in about 2 years. I'm pretty sure everyone as seen or at least heard that this one of the greatest movies of all time so I'm not going to get into all that. It sure is one of mine. All right, I tried to submit it but it wouldn't accept it without 10 lines so bear with me here. I really, really, really, really love this movie (yes that got me to the next line!) so I would definitely recommend it to anyone. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. Now. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for reading."
21 October 2010,rajasimanta,1,2,10,Pulpy,"Let's cut it short. Crime, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, you name it and this movie got everything pretty hard. MAN! From Starting to Ending, you're going to see the movie glowing and glowing. I gave it 9 'cause it feels boring for a little time for my 20 year, but this may not be in your case. This Movie definitely defines PULP. About acting, John Travolta did funny charming acting. Samuel L. Jackson did one of his best acting with that criminal/funny attitude. Bruce Willis was pretty good too. I'm a, so called Gen X viewer of the Kinda Old Movie. From my point of View, you definitely don't wanna miss this one. And an Advice, to get Max Entertain, watch the movie alone or with your buddies, try avoiding your girlfriend. Have a nice Pulping."
30 May 2004,JackA123,0,1,10,Orange Juice.,"""Zed's dead, babe. Zed's dead."" -Butch CoolidgePulp Fiction is easily one of the best films of the 1990's. A  priceless script written by director Quentin Tarantino makes the film pure gold. The story isabout two hitmen, a mob boss and his wife, a boxer, and two thieves whosestories are all tied up and connected, told in different segments. The script is hilarious and sometimes serious, it is still a great satire of a film. Again, Tarantino gathers a legendary cast including: John Travolta, Samuel L.Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel,and Christopher Walken. The dialog is never empty at all, the comic humor isnever old, and the suspense is never predictable. While Reservoir Dogs is agreat film, I like Pulp Fiction even better. Tarantino's best and one of the best mob films ever made. 10/10 stars."
6 June 2016,aizprua31,1,1,9,Pearl 90',"A good surprise I've been seeing this film, I had very little hope that this film came to like me, especially has a point engaging and keeps you entertained from beginning to the end without even making the slightest effort, even conversations are curious and entertaining, Tarantino is a director very category by works of cult like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill insuperable. The actors in this film are especially great among all make a perfect union that raise my score.The performances are quite correct, in my opinion highlighting the Uma Thurman, a pretty violent movie and too strong at times, is one of those films that scare even without cause tension and leaves you the willies at times. One of the things that also seemed luxury have been the musical interventions that appear, especially in which Uma Thurman dancing with John Travolta, that scene is epic, music can not be better because stick with the film, despite if not my genre I've been pleasantly surprised, just have errors, almost perfect, is not the kind of film that I usually fix although I have done and I am delighted for movie lovers this noventera wonder can not pass unnoticed."
26 September 2006,mighty_red,1,4,10,All Time Great of the Modern Era,"I loved this film as a kid and not for the violence (implied as it is...) but for the pop culture riddled throughout it. The scene in Jack Rabbit Slim's reminds me of Johnny Rocket's (tacky chain of Americana restaurants in Australia) - the film is just one giant homage to America and Tarantino's film influences.The complicated time line is a masterstroke by Tarantino, to the point where you feel it is pulp fiction (and not a traditional screenplay, which it actually is).Travolta is ""dumb cool""/uber chic, Samuel L is menacing, imposing and full of great quotes and Uma Thurman has some Lady MacBeth type qualities, and is incredibly sexy in an odd way.This film, I felt defined 90's pop culture and rounded off the work done by films like Clerks, Swingers (despite being after Pulp Fiction)etc. Rent it, burn it, buy it, whatever (just don't watch the TV version!)"
10 June 2017,gonzallanca,0,0,9,Good,"Pulp Fiction or in Spanish as ""Violent Times"" The film has stories, which are crossed between them. In the first we have 2 types (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) working to Marcellus Wallace, and must retrieve a golden suitcase. The second is a boxer (Bruce Willis) who after winning a fight, that Marcellus Wallace said that lose, escapes with the money. And the third tells a story of the wife of Marcellus Walace (Uma Thurman) and of his addiction to drugs.Let's start with the actors. The truth is that we all were excellent. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames. But, for me, the one that stood out from the other was Samuel L. Jackson, who with his first scene of ""I Dare You"" left me crazy.Now we are talking about really baby. The script and how they are connected the stories, is the most amazing thing i've seen in the cinema. Because you can easily you do a movie with the story of Bruce Willis, or with John Travolta And Samuel L. Jackson. But all this is what we owe to a Mr Quentin Tarantino, and his partner Roger Avary.As I am of the new school of Trantino (Bastards without glory, Django, the hateful 8) and I'm used to die all (or almost all) and in this film does not pass. And it is for this reason that this film left me with a kind of hollow, wanting more, of failure, of the movie.Also i think that the actors not involved in both the film, with all the money you gave them. The film focuses more on Vincent and Jules, who were those who participated more in the movie.Good 8/10"
16 February 2006,Angel-Shadow,0,2,10,"Pure and utter class, the royal of Films","Pulp fiction, pulp fiction, pulp fiction it never gets tiring, what a film, nothing short of class. Since i first joined IMDb I've noticed that 1994 wasn't a bad year for films with forest gump along with my favourite film of all time the Shawshank Redemption. As well as these two gems came Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Pulp fiction is one of those films which truly lives up to its reputation. The Film is so intricately detailed it blows your mind and gives you the 100% factor that all films crave, which is Entertainment. The characters of Vincent and Jules are so well portrayed and presented by Jackson and Travolta the characters really begin to grow on you. Normally there is a lead protagonist in many films, however pulp fiction follows the stories of just 3 with the same characters in different scenes and times. Pulp fiction's actual story is at first very confusing yet i feel this adds to the overwhelming sense that this is ' Pulp Fiction', it needs no explaining. When i first saw this film I got nothing less in quality than i expected , but a completely different film experience. The dialogue in this film along with the accents is unsurpassed with such classic lines as (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) ' I don't dig on swine sa'll' and ' You hear that billy boy??'' and of course the classic 'Royal with cheese'.Pulp Fiction is occampanied with truly fantastic fast flowing music to go hand in hand with the films unique often in my case unexplainable genre.So from this the one thing that can be deduced from Pulp Fiction is that it is truly unique with innovative ideas and audience pleasing scenes. Bruce Willis takes on a surprising role in the form of Butch the boxer trying to scam his way past big time heavy Marcellis Wallace. I don't wish to give to much away in this review as i think its harsh on many people, however i can say Uma Thurman looks by far at her most visually stunning in her first film - big break. She portrays the character of Mia beautifully with believable, often at times sexy methods at steering away from her true personality.It would be fair to say Quentin Tarantino has created a true gem for the film world with a truly fantastic script, fantastic dialogue and ultimately great acting. Pulp Fiction really is a Royal with cheese 10/10"
27 August 2020,jon_carlson-28953,0,0,8,"Very Good, Not Great","""Pulp Fiction"" has a couple plots, two hitmen collecting a suitcase, a boxer and his wife on the run, a couple who stick-up places, and a guy who takes his boss' wife out on a date. Various, interconnected, hijinks ensue. It's a fun ride. It's got action, suspense, comedy, drama, and excellent acting all-around.The magic of this movie however, what will ""make it or break it"" for most viewers is the dialogue. It's now classic stuff, but in 1994 it was very real, for lack of a better word. People talking about interesting, amusing, and unusual people, stories, and subjects. Are these important to the plot? No. Are we gonna meet this people? Probably not. But it's the kind of thing where if you heard it in real life you'd find yourself listening with a mild interest. Rarely have films ever had such approachable dialogue. And many have tried- and failed- to replicate this level of normalcy in the way characters speak.It's action scenes are exciting, yet believable, even the unbelievable is believable because they frame it in such a way that is not too far from reality. Even if it means questioning the whole thing. But it's this level of tame excitement that keeps the film from reaching new heights and being just short of greatness. This movie won't change your life, make your spirit soar, or stir your emotions to tears like a truly great movie does. But you won't soon forget it."

6 May 1999,halnexus,0,0,10,**** (Out of four),"This is filmmaking at its apex.  Though I would hardly argue that this film is the greatest, which is what many IMDB users relate after they've just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next ""Titanic"" or ""Matrix"" hype machine bursts their way, I must say that ""Pulp Fiction"" added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s. And who can argue with that? Indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book, and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldn't be more right.  When the film came out, a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipness...Being hip is cool, but I wouldn't necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at ""Men in Black"", which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that ""Pulp Fiction"" has become. So what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd?  It's exactly this spirituality...watching the film, I remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time, being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird California former video clerk's world view.  The film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style; one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"".  It is the scene where Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltz's front yard and brings the OD'ed Thurman inside his house.  As Rosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two, the camera (wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between Arquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman (that's the Scorsese part).  Then, as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz, reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in ""Rosemary's Baby"" by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction.  Such a phrase can be used to describe ""Pulp Fiction"": most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience.  This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action.  I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over ""Natural Born Killers"".  Now don't get me wrong, Oliver Stone is a powerful filmmaker, but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like ""I'm Going to Use my Artistic License to Satirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete With...Over-the-Top Violence!""  In the style of David Spade, ""It's called hypocrisy, Oliver--check into it!""  Anyways, I digress.  Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmaker's dream in revitalizing cinema.  You can say that the film's tone didn't impress you, that its style wasn't to your taste...but you can't deny the artistry that went into it.  Morality? For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty, I suggest you rent the family favorite ""The Santa Clause"" and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film.  Or in ANY family film.  What impressed me the most when I first saw ""Pulp Fiction"" was its inclusion of God at all, many Generation-X filmmakers (paging Kevin Smith?) are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. You can have those other indie favorites ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Good Will Hunting""(both starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of ""oh-feel-sorry-for-me"" melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock (best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a ""Simpsons"" episode: ""All's we got is our millions of dollars, our legions of fans, and our youth.""), then you can have them. Compare that to Jules' awakening (""I was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as 'a moment of clarity'."") and you'll see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well. ""Pulp Fiction"" is, in my opinion, the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever."

                        ",Great Movie,"If you have read any of my other comments, I usually olny comment on the movies I hate.  That is because they trigger emotional responses from me, in most cases, dissapointment and hate.  But here, I am writing this review because I felt awe after seeing this movie.  I absolutely love this film. The dialogue is hilarious and it provides great insight into the lives of those involved in organized crime.  Fiction or not, it still is pretty realistic. There are several great things about this movie.  1)  Characters.  The characters portrayed by.....everyone in this movie are great.  These characters have depth, humor, and are colorful. 2)  Story.  This is not a movie for people who only half pay attention. A lot of laughs are caused during this movie because you think, ""So that's why that happened.""  People complain that this movie has no plot.  If you can't find a plot, look harder.  It is basically about the lives of 4 people over a course of 2-3 days.  Even though it is so simple, the situations these people go through in these days are comical and interesting. 3)  Direction.  Tarantino is just plain great.  The camera angles and sets are colorful and cool.  The moods are dark and, well, moody and the music is incredibly well matched to the scenes and locations.  Good job, amigo. This may not be a movie for everyone.  But if you like movies like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Four Rooms,""  don't pass this one up. Final Thought:  Great, one of my top 10."

From the opening ""Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!"" scene - Misirlou!, to the end of the story (halfway through the film) Tarantino keeps you guessing and paying attention to the whole movie (so that the ""ending"" is explained). And might I mention the brilliant acting by: Sam ""the man"" Jackson, John ""the comeback kid"" Travolta, Harvey ""The Wolf"" Keitel, Quentin ""hey, it's my movie"" Tarantino, Bruce ""Zed's dead baby"" Willis, Uma ""adrenaline"" Thurman and Ving ""I'm gonna git medieval on yo' "" Rhames just to name a few.

11 May 2014,VinayNair,1,2,10,Epic Thriller !,"This movie by far is the best cult fiction movie ever made, streamlined performance of Samuel L. Jackson, makes it a wonderful dark thriller of ages by far known as the era of amateur crime becoming professional in a way. A must watch in any movies list before you die. Epic thriller of all time and the twists in plots with an ultimate climax takes the movie into the very next level, a true entertainer of sorts with a great impact on the box office in those time. it is one of the highly rated movies of all time and a well directed, acted, produced combination. The in depth realisation of each character is another strong point of this film with major emphasis given on the lead actors the movie takes a good support from the female actors who helps in the building up of the story. The supporting role are well organised and created intellectually, the contribution from each department of the movie is prominent and locations of shooting and storyline settings are well taken care about. The movie has won much appreciations and great audience support and is still a celebrated movie worldwide. The movie can be guided into the record books as the very literature of film making."

I am no violence junkie, although in a certain context, it serves a purpose, nor am i a highbrow - hell, i liked Die Hard for what it was - a popcorn movie; and i sure as hell don't put myself above either mainstream flicks or indie features.

A film that has an excellent combination of action, drama, comedy with great performances that any real fan of Tarantino or this movie can quote on a dime. Forget about the fact that it revived the careers of many actors including John Travolta and a Post-Hudson Hawk Bruce Willis or it's notable impact on today's cinema (Catch .44 is one of the numerous failed attempts of catching the magic). Tarantino found a way to not only keep us intrigued for a solid two and a half hours (something not a lot of directors can do these days). But he did it the same way Seinfeld did for almost 10 years (with a lot more balls too, anyway.) He made you care about Vincent Vega, The Wallace's, Jules Winfield and the many supporting characters who have literally made careers for people (Eric Stoltz Exhibit A) that in real life would be scorn and condemned. Q as a fan of creative films, I thank you. As someone who still believes a fresh movie still exist, Thank You. More importantly for influencing pop culture as a whole, Thank You."

It is definitely a move that you need to watch at least 2 or 3 times to fully appreciate, but every time will bring new experiences. There are so many small little things going on in the scenes, you miss many of them the first time through.Plus the movie changes it;s starting middle and ending a few times throughout the movie, so it can be confusing unless you know in advance what to expect.This all makes for a REALLY great movie, very imaginative, funny, and totally riveting from the first scene until the last.The casting could not have been more perfect and the actors all seemed to be having truly enjoyed making this film.

The film is grand in its scope, and has great well rounded characters. The film implores flashbacks and jumps to tell the tale of the differing characters. It has an artsy feel, and a specific tone that is uniquely Tarantino. The acting is top notch like always, and the film is entertaining as well. The movie is filled with action, blood, language, and emotion. The film puts the characters in so many awkward and dangerous situations, you can't help but feel absorbed by the film. The film is chock full of character, and the banter between Vincent and Jules is a joy to listen to. Overall, I give Pulp Fiction (1994) a 9 out of 10."
9 July 2015,almosalami,0,1,10,This film is legend.,"This movie is the stuff of legends. It is probably the most influential film ever made - you can find this movie referenced in some way or another in pretty much every piece of media you have - and the amazing thing is, it is pretty much just entirely dialogue with long static shots to hold the viewer's attention on the great performances of the actors/actresses and the even more captivating & clever dialogue. And what's even more amazing is that you can enjoy this and even root for the characters even though all of them are pretty bad people. Between the philosophical discussions between the characters, the great one-liners, and talks about foot massages, and I absolutely guarantee you have never/will never see a movie like this ever again. It is so refreshing, so riveting, I am glad that I watched this film. Normally, I'd break a movie down into its fundamentals, but that's really all you need to know. And ow yeah, Samuel L. Jackson man. What more could you want?"
13 May 2016,ayreno,0,2,6,Understanding the hype,"Probably Quentin Tarantino's most known and popular film, Pulp Fiction weaves together several stories and characters in a non linear order, in fact no order at all, and mixes bloody violence, pitch black dark humor, witty and genius dialogue, and amazing characters into one of the most influential movies of all time. a brilliant movie that really isn't for all people, but should be seen by movie buffs around. The star studded cast was overwhelming at first, and the dialogue was amazing. But personally, the star of the show was Uma. I could watch the diner scene over and over again because of how well she plays her role."

10 August 2015,benjaminschofield,1,2,10,A masterpiece of epic proportions,"You only need to watch the opening scene of pulp fiction to understand why it is loved by so many around the world. This scene alone showcases the quality writing and gripping action that is then carried on throughout the entire movie. The film interweaves three different stories and each one is so beautifully told that it could be a stand alone film. This is thanks to the always exciting soundtrack, the fascinating characters brought to life through excellent acting but most of all through Tarantino's amazing writing. He manages to lace relaxed, witty banter with harsh macabre that keeps the audience second guessing but never knowing quite what will happen next. This film truly is a masterpiece thanks to it's ability to subvert so many conventions of cinema but still manage to keep the audience entertained."

19 February 1999,Loothor,0,0,10,"Appropriately named, excellently crafted.","This movie is excellent.  Why?  Most importantly it is original.  It can be said, quite accurately, that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films.  No one can ever accuse Quentin Tarantino of not doing his homework (""Repo Man"", or ""La Femme Nikita"" as obvious examples).  He even rips off much of his own material from ""Reservoir Dogs"".  But the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original.Many people have stated that ""Pulp Fiction"" has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned.  Frankly, I don't think imitation proves anything, AND I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films.  However, to my mind, ""Pulp Fiction"" is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting.""Pulp Fiction"" also has a few truly original moments.  Christopher Walken's wonderfully dry delivery of the ""Your father kept this watch in his ass for years"" story is hilarious.There is only one serious flaw in this film:  Quentin Tarantino is a very poor actor.  Thank god he confined himself to a small role.  If he really feels the need to be onscreen, he should just go ahead and pull a Hitchcockian cameo in his films. Sure it's derivative, but at least his screen presence will be minimized."
19 July 2005,martoff1,1,2,9,What else can you say?,"Great then still good now!Classic dialog, great cast but even better good characters.Timing was great for this flick to get Travolta, Jackson, Rhames,Thurman, Keitel, Roth, etc.It would be almost impossible to get all those people in one movie again unless you paid a ton.If your a director looking for a recognizable face get an actor thats had bad roles.My favorite scene has to be the car scene when Travoltas characters gun blows off the guys head.It comes off so natural your like whoa.The look overall is very real and vibrant without special effects. The story is unpredictable and fresh especially at that time.This will be a classic if it isn't one already.If you haven't seen it you need to."

Quentin deconstructed the film, and he knew the essence of postmodernism. What is postmodernism? Let us briefly talk about it. We must also understand that fuzzy standards, vulgar and elegant standards coexist vaguely, time is lost, and morals are broken."

From the screen play to the way the time-line is treated like, and of course the most important part. Christopher Walken 5 gold minutes. This movie is just pretty good, the screenplay is simply the best part of the movie by going in deep and not going straight forward like a action movie. And all the pop culture references and stolen references like the rectangle that Mia does when arriving at Jack Rabbit's Slim, Mia's dance that resembles a dance from Aristocats Also the most remember part are the Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta's parts and Ezequiel 25:17 definitely stole the show. But, although Bruce Willis part is good, it's not as good as the suit gangsters chapters is a good story.

22 June 2006,nisitpav,1,3,5,"Too Godard to be Tarantino, and too Tarantino to be Godard.","I first watched Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" over two years ago. I must admit I was amazed. Being not so much of a film-knower back then, I was completely set in awe about the fact that stylistically, this film was so unique - as compared to, of course, what I had previously seen. My formerly poor cinematic experience and knowledge led me to like this film. The raw violence, the exceedingly black humor, the story's complex and confusing structure, and finally, Tarantino's own treatment of the visuals, the sense of control the direction suggested, which lingered in long takes and worked as a very experienced tour guide to the viewer's eyes, falsely contaminated me with the belief that Tarantino was an auteur, or, depending on how generous I then was, a pure metteur-en-scene.You see, my criterion for judging a film has always been its personal reflection. Not its originality per se, but the manner in which an artist's personal thoughts and emotions are uniquely portrayed on film, both in terms of style and content. A director's ""signature"" must be visible throughout his work's body. Thereby, by watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I perceived the much celebrated Tarantino as one of those unique artists, almost ranking among such great auteurs as Hitchcock, Ford and Kubrick. Mistaken as I was, of course, I saw my own sense of appreciation and respect for Tarantino destroyed at the time when I first discovered the works of Jean-Luc Godard. Tarantino may be successful and admired, he may have won awards and earned a lot of money, but the truth is that he has achieved all that by almost imitating Godard's work. It's a pity that people today know Tarantino and have not heard of Godard. If you haven't seen any of his films yet, please do, and you'll find out that ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Jackie Brown"" are nothing but mere imitations of Godard's style. The tenacity of the camera, the often one-sided angle of rendering a scene, the deliberate pacing, titles, freeze-frames and the frequent self-indulgence that characterize the films of the french master, are also the qualities of Tarantino's films. Some, however, believe that Tarantino has only exploited Godard, meaning that he has used some of Godard's better stylistic elements and blown them up into something better. This maybe true, but the fact remains that whenever I watch one of Tarantino's films, I find myself thinking about the influence of Godard...It's completely understandable how Godard, when he saw ""Pulp Fiction"", declared: ""...they might as well have given me the money!!"""
1 February 2020,sahibsrivastava,1,1,9,Tarantino is the one!,"One of the classic of Tarantino, you wont regret watching this, you'll watch this again and again till you reach the IQ level of the filmmakers.

27 August 2005,hourglass44,1,3,7,"Good, but overrated","This movie is the flagship for the smug, self-aware sarcasm that pervaded the 1990s. While it is entertaining in a starkly violent way (observe Vincent Vega and Jules's greater concern for the cleanliness of their car after blowing the head off of their backseat passenger or Tarantino's focus on the silly pettiness of Vega's argument with Keitel's character whilst trying to figure out what to do with a dead body), the film is dripping with gauche vanity and retro references to the point that THAT becomes the unspoken star of the film. Of course, this is typical fare for Tarantino, so it should come as no surprise (anyone seen Kill Bill?).Bruce Willis's vignette is by far the best. Gritty realism (fight fixing, his crummy hotel room and neurotic girlfriend, his car-crash and fight with Marsellus Wallace) is combined with a clever and thoroughly unsuspected twist (stumbling into a homosexual, S&M rape, horror-scenario). This is where Tarantino is at his best; he just becomes a bit misguided when he focuses too much on sarcasm and quirky retro vanity rather than interesting, new storytelling.7/10 JEM"

Any of these stories could have been made in to longer, full length films. But I'm glad they were all crammed in to the same, excellent movie. Best film of 1994, but only just a notch above Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption."

I was in for a real shock seeing John travolta in it. I just used to think he was a bit of an all singing all dancing loser after watching 'Grease' when i was a little girl! But he kicked some ass in this film and as for samuel L jackson what a legend, this is now my all time favourite movie , i can watch it over and over and not get bored!.the only bit I'm not to keen on has to be the gimp scene! *cringes* i have to close my eyes at that part. any way great film"

13 May 2015,b-carter6,0,0,9,Crazy all the way through,"Quentin Tarantino really knows how to make a good movie. Intertwined movies are often my favorite and this movie is a prime example. Gathering a star studded cast, Pulp Fiction is focused on two hit men, a mob boss's wife and a boxer, none of which are explicitly connected. I like this movie and clearly a lot of other people do too because it's currently at the number five spot on IMDb's Top 250. That's got to be a good sign. Like many other Tarantino films, I loved the soundtrack. I also liked the dark humor that Tarantino would come to be known for later in his films. The characters are also a shining point in the film, my favorite being Jimmy, the short used character played by Tarantino himself."

                        ",An Original Hollywood,"Usually you will not find a film like ""Pulp Fiction"" come out of the highly formulaic realm of Hollywood.  That is precisely why Pulp is so popular with audiences and critics, the time has come for a new breed of film within the industry.  There are a number of elements which makes Pulp Fiction one of the best and most important films in Hollywood.Something that is very original about Pulp Fiction is of course its structure.  It is both a narrative and non-narrative film at the same time. Tarantino takes on the roles of a novelist and a filmmakers, simultaneously. He tells three stories instead of the conventional single story and they are told through a number of perspectives.  This makes the film much more interesting than usual and it tightens the shared universe that all the characters dwell in.Tarantino's film is not meant to be a parody like many interpret it.  It is supposed to represent real-life.  The film's structure is circular; the film ends where and when it began to represent the perpetual crisis of life, the unending conflicts that exist within the reality we live in.In fact, Tarantino emphases this point by attacking the Hollywood interpretion of life and displaying a conflict and contrast within that. Tarantino stereotypes many elements of his film to that of the conventional Hollywood presentation.  He typifies the crime genre with his characters (2 washed-up hitmen, the crime boss, the crime boss's wife), their costumes (black, sullen), the violence, the death, the drugs.  We see it all but then it is all twisted out of its conventional shape.  The hitmen do not talk like usual hitmen displayed on film.  They talk of TV pilots, toe massages and filthy animals.  And even though they start out in the typical gangster situation with an assigned murder and retrieval of some goods, we then follow them for the rest of the day, instead of abandoning that story right then and there.  We see conflicts and situations arise that are very unexpected and unusual for men such as these.  Both their language and situations are atypical of their stereotype.  We see that people of this constructed, everyday world do not go through a formula of life, they experience life in a seemingly unplanned fashion, just like real-life.And when you look at Pulp Fiction nowadays, it has the very appealing retrospective ensemble cast.  What I mean by this is that now everyone in it is a big star but back in 1994, they weren't all that they are now.  John Travolta was wash-up and Pulp redeemed his career, Samuel L. Jackson was not well known, Bruce Willis had come off a bunch of box-office bombs like The Bonfire of the Vanities and Mortal Thoughts, Uma who?, Ving Rhames was a vitual unknown, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are purely creations of Quentin Tarantino, Eric Stoltz was trapped in the 80s teenage genre.  In fact, Harvey Keitel was probably the only star but his character in the film was purely a creation of Hollywood and maintained that way throughout.  This film still has a lot of appeal when you look at the cover box in a video story nowadays because it has this huge cast.Tarantino's direction is also not that larger-than-life style that you are used to in a big Hollywood film.  He lets his actors live and really indulge into their characters.   He lets action take shape and remain on screen longer than would be expected such as Jules taking a long sip from a Big Kahuna coke or Butch walking to his apartment to retrieve his gold watch.  He puts lots in the edges of the frame like the board games Operation and Life while Mia is about to get her adrenline shot.  He integrates subliminal messages into his scene which take repeat and careful viewings to extract.  Pulp has so much, both on the surface and within; much more than Hollywood is used to.When you watch Pulp Fiction, try to remove yourself from those who feel they have to love it because everyone else does.  Love it for what it really has and for what you can really see and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.  You will usually only find a film with any similar merit as Pulp Fiction in the realm of non-narrative, avant garde cinema.  But now that style has invaded Hollywood so take advantage of its genius and enter the world of fiction (but remember that nothing is as it seems, maybe even the title)."
13 November 1999,Darragh-2,1,2,10,Tarantino's the master.,"If you haven't seen pulp fiction yet you are missing out on one of the best films of our generation.  Violence, sex, drugs, and more coarse language than you can count, but put together in an intelligent, intriguing manner rather than a ""Hey, come look at this controversial stuff,"" manner.  The dialogue is the best of any movie I have ever seen and quite probably the best ever.  Great acting around the board (including three Oscar nominations), especially Samuel L. Jackson. Very near perfect, very difficult to top."
15 July 2013,sesmith70,0,1,7,Pulp Fiction - A great movie,"I saw this on DVD recently, and was really pleased with it. From the opening scene with ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" until the last scene, I was glued to the screen. Seeing all the big names interact was a lot of fun. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and more. All the characters had an important part in the story. No minor roles, and all of them should have been given an award! The scene with the ""gimp"" was a bit disturbing, but it didn't hurt the viewing. Tarentino's films are always gripping your attention and holding it until the last credit goes by. I highly recommend this movie. Be sure to get the DVD with the extras, and you will enjoy your night in front of the television. Start dancing the ""bat-tusi"" and have fun!"

John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all bring their own unique style to the tim and it is exciting to see the dark side of society instead of the characters always being good-hearted and genuine. The filmmakers did an amazing job with the different story lines and how they were able get all of them to tie together. the traveling through time can be confusing but it also allows the audience to to see how the characters lives become tangled at different points in the movie."
20 January 2018,pachys,0,0,10,"One Of The Best Movies In History, Easily.","Where can I start? This movie is simply amazing and will forever be one of the greatest movies of all time. Let's start with the genius of the GREAT Quentin Tarantino, who in his second movie (Pulp Fiction), solidified himself as one of the greatest directors, winning an Oscar for best screenplay for Pulp Fiction, and the movie winning the most prestigious award in film, the Palme D'or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival in France.One of the reasons for why this movie is so good is because of Quentin's use of nonlinear storylines in this film. It's so unique how Quentin put events in different order and it was so fun to watch, He did it in a way that you wouldn't be confused as well, you would be surprised and then you would find out the true order of the film when you continue to watch it. The cast and the acting, oh my goodness it's amazing. This is another reason for why the movie is so good. Quentin Tarantino revitalized John Trovolta's career by placing him in the role of Vincent Vega, one of the mobsters in the film, and he does not let us down. He plays the role so perfect that it became the best acting performace of his life. We all know Samuel L. Jackson now, super famous and great actor, but before Pulp Fiction no one knew him. Quentin Tarantino not only revitalized John Travolta's career with Pulp Fiction but he gave Samuel L.Jackson a chance and introduced us to an amazing actor and it was legendary. Jules Winnfield, the other mobster in the movie, who Samuel L. Jackson plays, is nothing short of a spectacular character who is funny and a bad-ass at the same time and Sam plays him perfectly. The cast only gets better with Quentin bringing Tim Roth back, who was a major character in Quentin's first film Resovoir Dogs and giving Bruce Willis, who was achieving a ton of success from the hit ""Die Hard"", a major role. Bruce Willis plays the boxer Butch who is facing decline in the ring because of age. Like Samuel and John, Bruce plays Butch so good that I can't picture another actor playing him. Bruce is strong and bald as well and was more than capable of having that type of boxer swagger and meaness to him while acting and that is what made him the best choice to play the boxer Butch. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Quentin made another person famous, this time an actress, the great Uma Thurman, who plays The Bride in Quentin's movie series called ""Kill Bill"". In Pulp Fiction Uma plays the sexy Mia Wallace, who is the wife of Marsellus Wallace, the Mob leader. Uma plays her really well and put her name with some of the best in the movie industry. In the end, this film's story, screenplay, directing and cast are so amazing that it made it into a classic. It's hands down one of the best crime movies of all time, as well, with it's violence, humor as well and Tarantino's key to directing... the art of the unexpected. Watch this movie, it doesn't know how to dissapoint."

24 April 2006,leviot,0,1,6,Entertaining but it's pointless fluff,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME VERY MILD SPOILERS Pulp Fiction is an interesting movie which is funny, entertaining, contains some great lines and good performances by its actors. Now if I can only figure out what the hell the point of it is! Samuel L. Jackson is phenomenal, it's worth watching this movie just to see him as a bible-thumping eccentric criminal. John Travolta is great in a supporting role. Bruce Willis is also in this movie, although I've yet to figure out what exactly he's doing there.The movie begins with a scene of a guy and gal who decide to rob a café, the movie's ending is the continuation (and culmination) of that scene. To me, that was the only cohesiveness in a movie that essentially has no plot or cohesive storyline. All the stuff in between is just a collection of scenes about drugs, violence, partying and some more violence.I'm the type of guy who enjoys deep movies, and movies with hidden messages and the like, but I've yet to figure out what the point of this movie is. It seemed like the general theme of it is ""what goes around comes around"", but that still does not explain all the bizarre occurrences and interactions contained therein.Maybe there wasn't supposed to be a point to this movie. Maybe it's just for our transient amusement. Or perhaps it amuses the filmmaker that so many people are trying to find a point to a pointless movie. Either way, it's still worth watching. It has some not-to-miss scenes and dialouges. Rent it, don't buy it."

10 August 2014,raoulvdhoorn,1,1,10,card,"For Stuart Turner, the road to My Skeleton has been long and winding. Edinburgh native, Optimo regular, DJ, Red Bull Music Academy graduate, refugee from rock groups such as Degrassi, Russia and American Men, and for a short period a trainee corporate lawyer, much of Turner's debut album as Claude Speeed was sketched out on a guitar and laptop while he was travel-ling through India, Singapore and Cambodia.Subsequently, this material was refined and mixed at locations including Hudson Mohawke's studio in London and Kuedo's studio in Berlin, but it would be wrong to assume My Skeleton was in any way designed for club consumption. Instead, Turner's recent FACT mix – which eschewed beats in favors of twinkling drifts and droning computer music – offers a useful signpost to My Skeleton's contents. Present here is the fluorescent Cynthy glow and ADHD maximals that's common to his peers on the LuckyMe roster, but what's within is on a dreamy, ambient tip, melding classical minimalism, post-rock, cosmic Cynthy and systems music with an eye for personal exploration and spiritual reflection.Contemporary readings of such genres sometimes feel like the stuff of battle re-enactment, too studied to transcend their rich histories. On My Skeleton, though, Turner often takes pains to keep his music feeling living and breathing. 'Tiger Woods' and 'Spectral Choir' employ dancing Steve Reich patterns, but through these Turner laces weaving woodwind and ringing strings with half-heard field recordings from his travels, the bustle of a marketplace or the hum of traffic. There are songs, too: the melancholic twinkle of 'Hold On', featuring the folksy tones of female vocalist LW; or 'Taj Mahal', in which Turner takes the Mick in a manner that reminds me a little of Phil Elverum's work in lo-fie experimentalists The Microphones, his sleepy and sincere words half- buried under droning soft Xanthus and star bursts of heavily treated post- rock guitar. The title track breaks from the record's largely electronic recreations to employ a real string quartet, although thanks to pitch- shifting and diligent layering, there feels like no hard breaks between the real and the synthesized.There is trauma here, too, albeit sublimated into these woozy folds of sound. Turner's trip was prompted by bereavement, and here and there My Skeleton takes a turn into darkness. The Dom post-rock build of 'Prove You Exist' apparently went by the working title of 'Claude Speeed You Black Emperor', while 'Some Other Guy', which vacillates between diaphanous ambiance and harder Mego-like drones, is supposedly inspired by a visit to a tower of human skulls in Cambodia's Killing Fields. In the hands of some, this might come across slightly glib, a bit Selie- at-Auschwicz, but throughout My Skeleton, there's the sense that Turner is out to honestly communicate his own experience, even when emotions are embryonic, or sensations twisted by tiredness or fever. The result is a record that keeps the sense of a human being on a passage of exploration, its internal emotional landscape porous to the influence of the tumult and chaos of the world outside."

The Coolness of some characters is unbelievable, and 20 years later it has not lost anything of his brilliance. I mean the dialogs and the characters are just tarantinostyle, he's a league for his own. Even all his movies have something special, but pulp fiction is my favorite."

Full circle caught me off guard, and I laughed in the first 10 minutes and last 20-30. The middle was shocking and more shocking."

Not only does this movie keep you riveted on every plot twist, but this movie is a flagship for independent filmmakers everywhere. No movie since or before had the same dark comedy and attitude of this film. Tarentino had the tenacity to take actors and actresses and provoke the kind of performance necessary to bring them to their prime. Every scene is directed to perfection, leaving you stunned by the turn of events. While watching, I suggest looking for specific lags in the dialog and plot. When you think you recognize one, where nothing is happening, grab onto something and brace yourself because the movie is about to take a wild swing into action. This movie is a must see for all adult audiences."

28 October 2014,edahlmano,1,1,10,A piece of America,"This movie is a masterpiece on every level.All the references to McDonalds, the cereal that was discontinued, which Quentin has saved and put into the movie. It is all a piece of American culture. And coming from a guy from Europe, I simply love all that brand stuff. Following criminals in their daily lives, hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit. It is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions.The acting. Well I think John Travolta was bad, even tho he got critical acclaim. But Samuel give the performance of his life.The drugs. I like that this movie didn't focus on sex. It feels so cheap. Instead, it depicts a housewife's cocaine use. Classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin. It is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy, it didn't feel like a cheap trick.It is morbid humor, appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers, as well as for respected critics."
27 January 1999,Hippie69,0,1,10,Best movie ever made,"What is greatness? Well, when you have every independent director in the country trying to make a movie as good as yours, you have achieved greatness. All of you Pulp Fiction bashers should go watch Citizen Kane or something. Pulp Fiction is a truly great film, and one of the best of the decade. I'd rather watch Pulp over Kane any day."
5 January 2000,gsprods,0,0,10,Most influential film of 90s,"I didn't think Tarantino could possibly top Reservoir Dogs, but here he is only two years later, outdoing himself with Pulp Fiction, a bigger budget than Reservoir but still small by Hollywood standards. The film is a masterpiece, winning Tarantino the Oscar for original screenplay and getting well deserved nominations for Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supp. Actor (Jackson) and Supp. Actress (Thurman). My one complaint is that many people who rent the video are missing out on some of the joys of the film because most of the videos are cropped so that you can't see the whole screen the way you did in the theatre. For example, when drug dealer Eric Stoltz is in bed watching TV before Travolta calls him letting him know he and Uma are on their way over, you see a box of funny looking breakfast cereal (some outdated brand) that Stoltz is eating. In the video you can't see it, and you miss out on one of the funny sight gags Tarantino has in store for you. It's little details like these that help make Pulp Fiction a treasure to view long after the initial impact of the stories wears off. The film's style has been ripped off but only the Coen Bros. Fargo has come close to bringing us the same off beat pleasures. As the years go on, movie fans will be more and more surprised to learn Pulp Fiction did not win for Best Picture."
16 September 2001,Auselan,0,1,9,A paradoxical clarification of our confusing world,"Some people think that Pulp Fiction is unique because of its formlessness. However, not only does the film have form, stereotypical characters and a traditional moral framework, but it is a self-proclaimed derivative tribute to other classic films.  Pulp Fiction is unique, paradoxically, because of its laborious adherence to cinematic tradition.Except for the ending, the form is mostly linear: the coffee-shop incident is succeeded by Travolta's story (with Uma Thurman) which is followed by Bruce Willis' story.  The opening scene in the coffee-shop jumps back in time slightly (like a nudged record needle ) and what follows is the Samuel L. Jackson (with Travolta) interrogation scene; a dislocation which is reversed, or put right, at the end where the interrogation scene is followed by the coffee-shop scene (temporally correct).The final section of the film covers the time-period just before the start of the film and ends just after the start of the film.  It charts the bloody conclusion to the interrogation scene; Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta's baptismal hose-down (the head of the hose, looking like a gun, punishes them with a cold jet and cleanses them of their sin, like a re-birth; instead of being shot with bullets, they are chastised with water and re-clothed in ordinary civilian, rather than gangster, clothes) and ends with Jackson's conversion.  In the coffee-shop Samuel L. Jackson  the character with the most authority, partly due to his powerful Old Testament prose   has a religious revelation and gives up his gangster life.  It is the extremity with which this cliché (gangster has revelation and gives up bad life) is executed that makes it unique; it is the excessive conservatism of Jackson's divine enlightenment  with the miraculous escape from the bullets, the harsh baptism, and the gradual understanding of the bible quote he has repeated all his life  that is so shocking and surreal.  It is his complete lack of distinctiveness (his wallet doesn't have his name written on it, but Bad Mother F***er'  it may as well read Bad Guy') that makes him so memorable and iconic.A work of fiction that focuses on character-in-action is moralistic by default; morality being the manifestation of psychology when it interacts with the world.  The film tells three short-stories which focus on a certain character and end with that character reaching the moral high point of his life (like the thousands and thousands of other stories, both timeless and corny).  The first one involves Travolta and Thurman, the gangster boss's wife and ends with him saving her life, delivering her home safely before walking away (rather than sleeping with her).  The second is an escape story involving Bruce Willis which ends with him saving the gangster boss who was originally trying to kill him for an earlier misdemeanour.  The third and final story is the story of Samuel L. Jackson, ending with his conversion.It's a shockingly good film, with an absolutely inspired absurdity to it.
Pigs are filthy animals  I don't eat filthy animals.' - Yeah, but bacon tastes good; pork chops taste good.' - Pigs sleep and root and shit  that's a filthy animal.  I ain't eating anything that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own faeces.' - How about a dog  a dog eats its own faeces.' - I don't eat dogs either.' - But do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?' - I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty.  But a dog's got personality  personality goes a long way.' - So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.' - We'd have to be talking about one charming mother f***in' pig.'It is it's surrealism  with time becoming disjointed  that makes it so close to every day life (which is confounded by memories - the past living in the present).  It is a film that is so surreal that it seems real and so hackneyed that it is totally unique; it is a paradoxical clarification of our confusing world."

13 February 2006,Daniel_Jackson,15,43,1,By far one of THE WORST movies EVER!,"Blood and violence does not make up for horrible acting, bad plot, and ridiculous ""slap-stick"" comedy. It amazes me that so many brain dead Americans found this ""movie"" enlightening. I can not see why. I originally saw Pulp Fiction in the theater and was thrown-a-back, not because I was moved by it's greatness, but because I vomited all over the theater. I recently gave it another shot and ended up vomiting all over my family room. If any of you want to see a good movie that has great violence and great acting/plot, check out Se7en, or Fight Club, or The Boondock Saints, or The Way of the Gun. I suggest to all ... STAY AWAY from QUENTIN TORRENTINO and check out movies written/directed by David Fincher or Christopher McQuarrie. They are two of the best movie makers that have appeared in the last 20 years. Torrentino is a hack who steals all his ideas from Indy, low-budget 1970's films (mostly crappy Asian films) and makes millions of dollars pawning his regurgitated crap back to his loyal, if not brain-dead, fan base."
19 August 2014,singaldhruv,1,1,10,A visual delight.,"Pulp fiction, the magnum opus of Quentin Tarantino, is an absolute visual treat. The exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed. Backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast, the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films.The screenplay by Tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people. The film is replete with iconic moments, like the monologue perfectly delivered by Jules Winnfield (Samuel Jackson), the twist dance routine of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and the Mexican standoff in a diner. However, this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted, as a lot of R - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film.The soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully. 'Misirlou' sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits. Structurally, the film is divided into seven sequences, which have connected stories. As expected, the cameo from Tarantino himself as Jimmie, the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - The Bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake."
1 December 2007,Timeee,0,2,10,Cinematic orgasm,"My theory is that every piece of art, thus every movie, has to be evaluated, judged from the inside, by its own rules. This might be understood in many different ways; basically I mean that one should not start watching anything with an already prepared frame which he will then try to force on the movie. It's not possible to simply start from zero- we're human after all, and are influenced by our life up until the moment of watching a new movie- what we CAN do is throw aside stereotypical expectations and struggle to look at the movie from a multitude of points of view, in an open-minded way.""Pulp Fiction"" is for me the perfect example of a movie where clichés just don't work. The ""I hated it"" part of comments here is filled with complains about the poor plot, the lack of character development or the pointless dialogs. But even if their observations are all true, they're missing the point: none of those expectations are valid o Pulp Fiction, therefore the movie should not be judged based upon them. Wouldn't it be silly to complain about James Bond for not being realistic? or to underrate Harry Potter for being childish? A movie can be regarded from many alternative angles- not all of them are sensible.Watching -and of course re-re watching, frame by frame- this movie was simply a pleasure, a major source of cinematic satisfaction. I didn't care about the storyline or the morale, if it was any; instead I couldn't stop enjoying Samuel L. Jackson reciting his classic Bible-quote, or Mr. Wolf doing his job, or Marcellus Wallace talking to Butch, the music, the moves, the full-of-flavor acting and lines, making every moment so enjoyable that it made me watch it over and over again. This movie is not about what it's about, it's about HOW it's made. Dialogs seem stupid on paper- brilliant on tape (of course that doesn't mean that dialogs ARE stupid, but in this film they do not have the purpose to take the action forward- they are not a means to communicate, but have an inward value of themselves ). I have not enough words of praise for the acting; God bless Sam, John and Bruce for what they did.Never again will another movie like this be made- masterpiece, reason to live, whatever you want it to be."

It does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything There is a perfect balance of action which includes blood, shooting, and wicked gun fights! Comedy, because lets be honest Samuel Jackson is just down right hilarious. There is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes! I would totally recommend this to all of my friends.

The real funny thing about this show is when I saw it in the theater in 1994 I was initially very turned off by the violence-hated it the first time out. But after watching it a second and third (and now hundreds x's) time it grew on me, and I realized the violence blocked the meaning of the movie for me at first."
9 June 2012,raoulgomezmorille,0,1,10,Man o' man do I love this film,"The plot is simple but hard to explain. It is basically a story telling the intertwining lives of two mob hit men, a gangster, a gangster's wife, a boxer and two robbers.This film has a fantastic cast from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and Ving Rhames (I think I missed someone out but yeah, it's a pretty good cast.) They deliver their lines so naturally; you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters.The soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after you've seen it. It's safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to, sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film.This film Quentin Tarintino on the map as ""one of the directors to see"" because of the jazzy, cool vibe his films have. The directing is good with great uses of ""one shots"" and experimenting with transitions and angles (such as the angle in which John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get their guns from the car boot.) But the main star of the film is the writing. The writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors. You will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it. If you pick any line from this film, it will probably be a good one.Basically, this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do."
15 May 2006,coveycraig,12,35,1,So boring we walked out,"Because of the advance publicity, a few posters and an all-star lineup of actors; we planned to see Pulp Fiction as soon as it came out. I took my sister to see this movie on opening day in College Station, TX. The theater charged ""premium"" rates for the show, the two tickets cost me $70. What a mistake. It was so boring that we walked out after approximately 30 minutes and went for drinks instead. The only redeeming point to the evening was that I only wasted 30 minutes and $70 - I can at least cling to not having wasted several hours.This movie? Ignore the comments made by people who want to pretend they didn't get taken - save your cash and see something entertaining."

No, they go down on certain movies and up on others, as in, more cgi and oddities... and less acting, sure, I aint saying that CGI does alot, but if you take the Christian Bale Terminator one, that was spoiled, however, the upncomers, be it in a different timeline etcetera... and sadly, actors do grow old, yup, however, Arnold as old, that was a stinger splash right there, hit the sweet spot, same goes for movies like Pitch Black series or the Jeepers Creepers ones.... Horror usually never finds its way into peoples heart, yet I saw one today that totally blew me away, can only hope that Quentin brings this man fourth into the light. (obviously talking about who directed it, etcetera) Since its kinda like the 'lighthouse' which is just insanely good also for being a suspensful, strange, surreal movie... just odd that Daniel Day Lews isnt in it, but then again, considering that Willem DaFoe did such a job, doubt they would've needed DDL. Not saying I'm not a fan, I am, same with this fine and very humour driven actor named Christoph Walz(t?) who's by far blown me and my fellow movie lovers away with his performances and from what i've gathered, using research and such, quentin was the man who found another nugget, heck, he could probably make anyone shine, just cause he's that darn good, plus i love that he loves old school cinema too, them robert rodriguez flicks he made, grindhouse, death proof etcetera, just shows how much he's evolving from golden oldies like this, insanely great movies.... and just cause its from 1994, dont let it fool ya, it will leave any youngun who thinks a movie has to have Michael Bay blowing stuff up for 9 hours non stop, gasping for air after watching a viewgasm like this. a Hundred pints raised from a Tiger born in the sign of Leo, ex-spetznas alfagruppe #1733 Batallion, greetings to imdb and much love to anyone who loves a good movie, cheers from Chris/Sweden."
2 September 2000,erthling_2,0,1,10,A truly fantastic film,"In this Quentin Tarrantino written/directed film it follows three story's set over a few days and all collide together. (Warning i have given away LOTS of the story here so dont read on if you dont want to know!!!)The first story is where Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who has just returned from Amsterdam, is escorting his boss Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to dinner. Followed by a twist dance, an overdose at a drug dearlers house (Eric Stoltz), is the first story.the second story starts with a young child being told an amusing story by Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) about a gold watch, the young child grows up to be Butch Coolige (Bruce Willis who we see being bribed to go down in the fight earlier on) he of course doesnt and gets invoved in a car accident, a shoot out, and being raped by Z (Peter Green) along with Marcellus.In the third story which is my favourite we return to where two hitmen Vega and Jules (Samuel L Jackson) shoot dead some gangsters (have a mirical happen to them!) and have to dispose of a dead body in the back seat of a car, with the help of Jimmy (Tarrantino) and Mr Wolf (Harvey Keitel). they then at breakfast (all this happens at around 8-10am) have to deal with two resterauant robbers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, who we see discussing robbing the resteraunt at the beggining of the movie).All in all a fabulous movie, which is very confusing and you can get something new out of the movie each time.11/10 (its that good!!!)"

3 June 2016,kedarshetye,1,1,10,"Even after 20 years of its release, the film still feels so fresh.","The outrageously funny dialogue of this movie is what really drives it. Quentin Tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters. Despite its over two and a half hours long run-time, Pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in Tarantino's zany universe. You actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. Even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, I still can't remember what scene comes next. However, It's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes Pulp Fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. And of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. The characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. You never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly. I love it. Undoubtedly, one of the most quotable movies ever and most certainly my favourite movie of all time.So, Pulp Fiction, 10/10? Correctamundo."

There are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin! The long dialog scenes reads Tarantino all over it, and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes.

But I have a hard time describing it to people. Sure it's about killers, and drug users, and drug dealers, and rapists, and a boxer, but that doesn't summarize the film up. There is no way to properly sum the movie up for those unfamiliar with it. But I'll try.Everyone knows there are Three stories. I've always said four. But it's basically about shady people doing shady things. Any other information would be too in depth, and the movie should be seen with no prior knowledge beyond what's above.I saw this movie clean on my fourteenth birthday. Two days after the films release. As soon as I came out of the theater I knew it was the one. The movie that would hold a place in my heart as the greatest I've ever seen. It still holds that title to this day for me. Everything in it works. The Characters are legendary thanks in part to the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino. That doesn't even begin to do justice to just how well written this script is. The dialogue is the best you'll ever hear. And I will stand by that statement until the end of time. The characters, like I said, are all pitch perfect. Their concerns, actions, and moments of thought all are ingenious and yes, very originally displayed.But one thing that gets the short end of the stick in this film is the directing. While I feel it is Tarantino's second best directorial effort (Kill Bill Vol. 2 being the incredible first, in directing only, Pulp Fiction was the better film by far), this movie shows a directorial awareness not usual found in inexperience writer directors. The scene of Lance and the over dose was a Masterstroke. For example, the way the camera holds on the room, where Lance is digging for his ""little black medical book"". The camera holds on the room, but not on Lance. We (the audience) are outside and can't see him, but can see in parts of the room. The way Mr. Tarantino never cuts away, never looks away, and just holds that one shot of a cluttered room, builds the suspense. We hear Vincent and Trudy speaking in the background, but Quentin holds his one shot. Simply amazing.Through the years to follow there have been countless imitations of this amazing picture, too many to start naming, but none have ever caught a glisten of what Mr. Tarantino did here. All those directors wanted to be the next big thing in Hollywood, the next crossover sensation r from Indie into Mainstream. None came close. This movie had something the world had never seen before. A pure breathe of fresh air, that most embrace, and many loved. This was at the front of the Miramax wave of sensation, and with out this crown jewel, who knows where they would be today. But this is the kind of movie that gets people excited, that gets them talking, and had the whole country buzzing. Something I wish would happen again to a great film. (I know movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Passion of the Christ had everyone talking, but I don't consider those great movies at all) I am truly proud to call this my favorite movie of all time. I hope Mr. Tarantino keeps his flawless resume flawless, and continues to turn out consistently brilliant work."

The same feeling of parallel space, the same person, playing different roles in different stories, and the results of these stories are not the same, but the strange passage to the same person."
31 May 2020,z-12781,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction,"Another special feature of pulp fiction is its retro depiction of 1970s culture and its depiction of underclass culture. In the style of a black gang movie, the country, the crazy movie music, Jules' bouffant explosion of hair, and mia's tight shirt and bell-bottom pants all have a seventies vibe. Conversations about fast food, cosmetics and drugs, as well as the ubiquitous slangs and profanities, give viewers a better sense of the different facets of America's underclass."
13 March 2002,dcr400,1,2,10,Pulp-modernism!,"'Pulp Fiction' is the turning point of post-modernistic, or pulp-modernistic, film-making.  It is laced with extraordinary characters and one of the most original screenplays ever written.  The dialogue is verbose and witty and the actors carry it off perfectly.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson steel the show with a wonderful chemistry that ignites the screen.  It is a film that has firmly embedded itself in our popular culture and changed the way we look at narrative structure in film-making; 'It's non-linear, everything good art should be.'"
24 June 2018,gizd-1,6,18,1,"Interesting film, but has absolutely nothing to say.","The film is very seductive, but there is really no story to it, no meaning, no point. The characters bear no resemblance to real people, they're shallow. Tarantino is good at the craft of filmmaking, but he is shallow himself. Whenever something meaningful should happen, he puts in a non sequitur in a way that makes is seem as if it is deep, but any meaning evaporates on reflection. Probably the most over-rated film ever."

Well you could say that this movie was. Terrific cast, and there is not one single disappointment in performance in this intire movie. Great plot and motivation keeps you wondering and wanting more every minute you watch this movie. Strong dialoge always helps a movie but in this case it makes the movie. The unbelievably wild dialoge is great in every way, and it actually sounds like people would talk and not like actors spouting lines off. A big thank you goes out to Quentin Tarantino, because he wrote the script for this movie and it is one of the most cherished and memorable scripts in movie history. All in all this is one terrific film and a must-see even if you are not a Tarantino fan..."

                        ",What a load of crap. Only dead head 'arty' wannabe's would pretend to like it!,"This is one of the most pathetic films i have ever seen. the acting is wooden, the storyline (if it can be called that) is convoluted and weak, scenery is boring and only weak minded followers will sit and say that the film was any good. John Travolta was  obviously trying to make a comeback and I don't know who he paid for the reviews, but for some obscure reason, other critics jumped on the tailfeathers and 'raved' over this film. Which is a shame that they can't stand on their on 2 feet and say what needs to be said about this trivial sorte into bland, mild mannered toilet humour sex scenes, inane attempts at humour and woeful blase acting. This film stinks! I refuse to follow like a sheep and even pretend to like it, possibly one of the worst and certainly one of the most over-rated movies ever shown to the public."
19 June 2007,maria-512,0,2,9,Everyone should see this at least once.,"I'm not the biggest fan of Quentin Tarantino, I find his dialog to be a bit tedious at times, but he did VERY well on this film. Some of the dialog & situations are a bit silly, and some of the dialog runs on for a little too long, but it's not so bad that it's distracting, and as I said, it's what one expects from Tarantino. It's still entertaining.The most remarkable thing about this movie for me is the way the independent story lines converge & diverge effortlessly. THAT was brilliant. Unfortunately he's used this mechanism before, to lesser degrees, but it really worked so well this time.The cast was nothing short of brilliant, really - I don't say this lightly. There are too many brilliant moments for me to try to isolate the brightest performance - even the supporting cast was brilliant. To remove or alter one performance would diminish the overall experience. It's incredibly rare in film that a cast of this size would be so consistently good.You may not care for the at-times dark subject matter, you may not care for the fact that it doesn't have a pronounced point of story resolution at the end, you may not care for the excessive cursing, but you will enjoy this movie immensely."
7 September 2002,RicFlair,1,2,10,My all time favorite movie,When I first saw Pulp Fiction I didn't really get it and thought it was boring as hell. Later on I bought a cheap VHS version of it wanting to give it a second chance - and I wasn't sorry! I've since seen it lots of times and have recently gotten the 2 disc Collector's Edition DVD of it.Pulp Fiction is a thrilling tale of interesting characters whose life interfer with each other throughout this 150 minute movie. 3 stories told as one. Amazingly enough the dialog carries it all the way showing how good a screenplay writer Quentin Tarantino really is.See this movie - I give it a perfect 10

Great stories about hope, about drugs, about finding oneself and what not. Little did I know that there can be a great story about nothing. Then Pulp Fiction came along and not one day has gone by when I've gone to sleep without watching Samuel Jackson deliver the Ezekiel speech. Can a movie get more laid back and more stylish. Not Possible. Don't search for a story in this one because there isn't. Each scene just stands out on its own. In short, its a masterpiece of extraordinary proportions. There will be more great movies about hope, about love and about what not. But there may never be a greater movie about nothing. There may never be another Pulp Fiction."
25 April 2009,lurker176,1,2,9,The Perfect Film,"Pulp Fiction is the movie lover's movie. Every performance is outstanding (save for maybe Tarantino's cameo), every line memorable, and every scene fun to watch. The movie is divided into 3 bite-sized chapters, presented in a non-linear format. The movie is a glimpse into the brutal ""Tarantinoverse"", a world where anything can happen (as long as it's entertaining). Tarantino seems to collect every single cliché, reference, and element of American pop culture and shuffle it into a cinematic masterpiece of a card deck. This whole movie takes the past decade of film and redefines the future with it's witty dialog and fast, ruthless scenarios. A must see for anyone who likes movies, this is an artsy, award winning movie that doesn't force you to think. Grab a Quarter-Pounder (or Royale, as they call it in France), put your feet up, and enjoy Quentin Tarantino's unbeatable creation."

                        ",Tarantino's Masterpiece,"Many people believe that this was the film of the 90's, that is an argument that will go on forever but Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece is definitely in the top 5, if not top 3. Pulp Fiction is the film that ressurected John Travolta's career and also catapulted Samuel L. Jackson's. A Brilliant mix of violence and humour saw Tarantino (the former LA video store worker) collect his Oscar for Best Screenplay and open a new style of movies in Hollywood. Boasting one of the best casts of any movie with stars such as Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken and Travolta and Jackson, Pulp Fiction is the must watch movie of the decade with a great plot, brilliant script and flawless cast."
10 October 2009,cxerophim,1,2,8,Surprisingly Good,"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino and believe that his work is often too convoluted and involved to develop any of the characters fully; *however*, Pulp Fiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plotwise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the only scene I didn't like was Uma Thurman's. Other than that, I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' ""top 10""."

It would be futile to say ""this is the greatest movie ever"". There are movies, and there is Pulp Fiction. An unbelievable stroke of genius that might as well never shine upon any other man has struck Quentin Tarantino... Pulp Fiction is both refreshing and intriguing, and its style makes it an unbelievable piece of art. Oh, the style. There is nothing too common here, but then again, nothing to make you jump from your seat and say ""this is bullshit"", or ""this cannot happen"". QT just makes it happen with ease, in an unbelievably believable manner. A must must must see. By the way, when I first posted this comment, it was only at #18 in the top 250, and now it is at #8.

                        ",The story MANGLES and DANGLES with perfect right ANGLES!!,"Tarantino has created an exclusive genre here, with its twists and curves and steel-ball nerves. PF is a masterpiece which finally breaks ground in the big vacant lot that Hollywood has (until now) been a-feared to trod upon. Only someone with no fear of the ""Hollywood Machine"" could make such a movie. This lashing-out of Tarantino's claw opened a gash in the blue-blooded Hollywood flesh, and it's about time! It may seem to run a little long at times, but the opening of a new category of film is worth the few slow-moving periods. I personally believe that the biggest success here is Tarantino's rise from a video rental clerk to a major film director. For those who have a desire to go down a certain path, do what QT did and see what happens!"
15 November 2010,redout22,1,2,10,Style without substanceand I like it!,"Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantino's best film was. Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Having seen all three, the opinion I submit is the majority opinion—Pulp Fiction. But why? Pulp Fiction, in my view, represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point? It's actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesn't use extensive special effects, or mind-bending plot, or bizarre character development. Tarantino, in fact, wrote this one pretty much by-the-book, along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But it's the careful eye of the artist, in front of and behind the camera, that makes this film such a treat.I have watched it six times already, and each time, the movie just gets better. Each time, I see something in the background that I didn't see before. I catch something someone says, or see some minor backdrop detail that I didn't pick up on. However, this isn't why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing.It's the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was. This film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny Hollywood Heights. The music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie, and the use of the Hawthorne Grill and the Chevy Nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie, even though it's quite apparent that it's set in the modern day. Butch is driven to the hotel in a Checker cab, everything in general feels older than it really is.But what really sells it is the actors. Today, this wouldn't be a star-studded cast, it would be a diamond-studded, cast-on-platinum cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make perfect hit men, and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. Uma Thurman's small role is nevertheless appreciated, and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers, but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. At the end, though, I feel that Jackson is the star, even though there is truly no primary role here. His monologues are to die for in this movie.All in all, if you have not seen Pulp Fiction, change that."
30 January 2005,Naoum,0,2,5,Humoresque of the Grotesque,"OK... I have seen some Tarantino movies and I liked some of them. I enjoyed From Dusk Till Dawn better since the turn in the middle of the story was quite unexpected .Here I am puzzled. I like the way the stories get into one another and I like the ""juicy"" characters. The music is cool and the cast is superb. But for what? Maybe I am not into what I call the Humoresque of the Grotesque and if I was I would have thought it was brilliant, however it's a little sad to watch so much violence. I didn't find it funny to kill by mistake... The disrespect for human life was a little bit frightening for me.Well, that's that and what is great for some is not so great for others... I think however that it's a movie that one should see to form an opinion with all the mythology that surrounds it."

Everything is on point from the story, to the story telling, to the actors, to the music chosen and all the little side conversations/side story's. Some scenes are shot in one long take and really make you feel like your there more than a mash of different shots. Riddled with memorable lines and almost an feeling of cool in the air as odd as that may sound. A bit graphic and harsh at times but is never pointlessly violent, just enough to feel real. It doesn't more fast beginning to ending but when it does move fast it goes as fast as humanly possible.

You will enjoy how he uses his characters to eloquently describe the situation and go along with it. And those unexpected accidents that occur throughout the film are way too humorous and entertaining. The non-linearity of the script is the key feature of the film's success. We wouldn't have liked it, if the screenplay had been linear. Oh, and need I mention about the soundtracks? They seemed like they were composed originally for the scenes. No wonder, Tarantino got an Oscar for the screenplay! I'm giving it a 10, because the movie deserves it."

                        ",Not for the amateurs.,"If you're one of those whose idea of great cinema is happy people in happy cities with happy endings, Pulp Fiction is not for you.  For the cinema ""buff"" who will appreciate something different and not be threatened by something out of the mainstream watch Pulp Fiction.  Nearly 80% of independent films have an element of Pulp Fiction in them.  Be it the dialogue dealing with pop culture, in your face violent scenes or the new film noir look which Tarantino invented.  One can appreciate this film for many reasons.  For one, Tarantino does not treat the audience like total idiots much the way most directors do.  He will let us judge things on our own and more importantly he does not attempt to save the world.  Every scene was skillfully thought out and perfected.  If his style offends you then perhaps you can rent ""The Sound of Music"" or ""Pretty Woman"" and get your spirits up again!"
20 April 1999,smck,0,0,8,Best of the B's,"John Travolta got all the press, but it's Samuel Jackson who provides the snap, crackle & pop; he is unforgettable as a pontificating hitman.Tarantino borrows and/or steals from everyone and everything, be it Hong Kong or blaxploitation, but he does it well; this is one glossy, good looking, smartly written 'B' movie. Amanda Plummer, Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel, among others, provide great support; only Bruce Willis (as usual) drops the proverbial ball. But even he's not enough to sink this terrific picture."
18 July 2016,jscmns,1,2,10,An unintended postmodern examination of film,"Tarantino takes us through a journey of the postmodern abyss his characters are dropped in. You might retort this by saying I don't speak English, but frankly, I think I speak the new language. That's right, the new language of postmodernism. The language of a land where every character is a victim of subjectivism, where every time we want to look at the movie we peer to nothing whole. We only get sneak peeks of the performances of the actors and the landscapes and places they find themselves in. It never becomes a coherent whole. This is a movie that clashes with peoples' sense of what a movie should be. It's precisely a movie that shouldn't be. The ""incoherent"" story lines and ""pointless"" dialogues lead us to the same place. There is barely any change we just move in a circle. And there goes another confrontation to the modernist though: time is not linear, postmodernists say.Now, I doubt Tarantino has any idea what postmodernism is, since he's a filmmaker, not a philosopher, and I doubt you could consciously make a postmodernist film. But this is, without a doubt, the truer representation of our times: a bunch of characters lost in an urban hell, who interact with each other, something we think would be relevant to the storyline, but wasn't. There is no ulterior motive here, it's just a day in the life of a few assholes in a hellish L.A. Which looks remarkably average, not exceptionally detached from our experience.The dialogue is one contentious point with people who are used to dialogue leading somewhere. Dialogue doesn't lead anywhere in this case. It barely moves forward, except when it needs to move forward. Otherwise it just gets stuck in the same place, like real dialogue. This is not your average Hollywood drama. Tarantino liked to do this around this time. He liked subverting clichés. Now, his filmmaking style doesn't subvert clichés, because he has made his style a cliché. We know what to expect from a Tarantino film. But when Pulp Fiction came out, everyone was astounded. What's surprising is that people still are shocked by it, and still don't understand what the film is getting at.That's right, it's getting right at your preconceived notions of time and space. Other films along the same line are Fargo, Big Lebowski, Fight Club, anything by Iñárritu, and of course, the quintessential postmodern film, Breathless, by Jean Luc-Godard. Good art should be questioned. This movie raises a number of questions, not deep, philosophical tirades about existence, no. It raises the question of how we perceive ourselves in time and space, how we conceive of our place in the world. And like all postmodernist though, it provides no answers."
9 May 1999,Osiris-11,0,0,10,Tarantino's Best.,"To lend myself to the cliche, Tarantino has revolutionized cinema.  Some praise him, some berate him, some despise him, and quite a few lose sight of what he has brought into the mainstream.  In this, his best work to date, Tarantino succeeds in telling one of the most realistic tales ever to find its way into theaters.  It is this realism that makes Tarantino so impressive a director.  While epics like Braveheart and Titanic concern themselves with the most noble points of human existence and morbid thrillers such as Se7en focus on the lowest depths of depravity, Pulp Fiction instead stays firmly in the middle ground of daily experience. The film has been criticized as glorifying violence and drug use.  Instead I feel this movie simply portrays such facets of society, and portrays them very similarly to the ""real world.""  Pulp Fiction, along with Tarantino's other films, is so captivating because the characters are so very human, more than a collection of catch phrases and a cool exterior.  Tarantino offsets this stark realism with offset chronology, drawing the audience in even further by making them fit the pieces of the plot together in their minds.  Granted, Tarantino was not the first to use the directorial techniques that make Pulp Fiction a fantastic story.  He did not use them first, but he has used them best.  He is so good at what he does that Pulp Fiction is a great movie despite his own acting.  That alone is worthy of an Oscar."

                        ",Palatial Pulp,"Pulp Fiction is one of those wonderfully compelling, beautifully written, absurdly unpredictable films that come along every now and again.The subject matter, -a pot-pourri of various low-life scumbags' and their daily doings, is so lovingly crafted. Each story and set piece so silkily woven around an underbelly that is usually used to coarser a cloth.No member of the cast is found wanting. No part of the storyline a disappointment. If violent movies have to be made, then this is the way to make them. The cartoonish manner of both characterization and action makes it far more digestible than films such as Goodfellas.A special mention for Samuel L Jackson. He is the axle on which the whole thing turns. I think he was highly underestimated and was generally crowded out in the plaudits by supporters of cinema's prodigal son,- John Travolta.Score 9/10"
22 June 2000,Mr Dread,0,0,10,This movie deserves all the praise it is getting!,"( A ) I could understand why some people might hate this movie; and I respect that. However, what I don't understand is why someone would say that Tarantino is a bad or not good enough director. It's simply not true and you know it! This movie was done very well in more areas than one. Somehow the characters seem more natural in their behaviour, the way they speak, etc. The stories aren't deep and the plot isn't very rich because it isn't supposed to be. This is just a look at some criminals caught in some interesting and messy situations.In order to really like this movie, you need to set all your expectations aside and --very important-- watch it more than once. You'll probably like this movie even more the second time. But if you didn't like it a bit the first time you saw it -- don't waste your time! Find something else to watch. This is the kind of film that you either love or hate. I love it.The cast is great, the acting is amazing. The characters are very vivid and interesting. And even though some of the situations are a little outrageous, Tarantino still made them believable. Butch's story was very entertaining, and Jules is just the coolest - I like how he handles the coffee shop robbers at the end (even though it's not really ""the end"")...And the soundtrack -- fabulous. I think Tarantino has good pretty good taste in music. You won't find any scores for his movies, though - just really cool tunes from the sixties and seventies that were once popular, but were forgotten. As for the violence... there isn't much of it really. Yes, you heard me right. Next time you see PULP FICTION count the number of times you see a really violent scene and you'll realize it's not more than any other action/crime movie... And notice that they don't show that much -- it's mostly your imagination filling in what the camera doesn't show you.
I recommend this movie to all true motion picture fans."
28 January 2000,moviedeal22,0,3,6,as bad as movies can get,"This Movie was just a mere way to earn a few bucks for no-good, useless, can't think of anything movie Producers. It was just one of those movies that use a lot of famous movie stars to maybe make the movie a bit better than it is, well at least you'll know there's no bad acting.  It sucked and made no sense what so-ever. what a waste of my 2 hours. thank you Hollywood!!"
8 July 2020,q-42368-49274,0,1,9,Pulp Fiction,"Another special feature of pulp fiction is its retro depiction of 1970s culture and its depiction of underclass culture. In the style of a black gang movie, the country, the crazy movie music, Jules' bouffant explosion of hair, and mia's tight shirt and bell-bottom pants all have a seventies vibe. Conversations about fast food, cosmetics and drugs, as well as the ubiquitous slangs and profanities, give viewers a better sense of the different facets of America's underclass."
19 April 2022,jackctierney,0,1,9,Tarantino at His Best,"Movies are just not made like this anymore. The scenes are prolonged with smart acting, genius scripting, and tension-building moments of anger, revenge, violence, and redemption. I couldn't be more windblown by Jackson's performance when he swells up fear inside his victims; he is a convincing, witty, and formidable hitman who, although buts heads with Travolta's character consistently, proves to be a perfect match with him in this ingenious piece of Tarantino magic. I was uncaptured in every scene. My jaw hung open while my brain oozed out of my ears; incredible, just incredible."
21 July 2008,patriots2772,11,37,1,worst movie ever,"i finally got around to watching this bc everyone praised it, except my parents, they told me not to watch it and i disregarded their opinion... boy what an idiot i was, this indeed was not the best movie ever but the WORSTthis movie had no point, jumped all over the place, said f*** way too many times, and waaaaay to long for something that had no pointQT is not a genius for making this movie, a moron if u ask me... i really wish i could hit him in the face for me wasting 2hrs of my life on this crappy moviethis movie deserves a 1/10 for its unoriginal plot (if it had one), terrible script, and why does QT have to play a part in his movies? he cannot act"
5 January 2015,miriamandrea-f,6,14,2,Overrated,"I had high expectations of this movie that is so well rated. The truth is that i couldn't deal with it, and i forced myself to watch it to the end expecting that it would improve, but it didn't... No story, no plot, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own ""witty"" dialogue.I loved watching Reservoir Dogs, but this is a joke. The only thing that i can save are the performances of great actors in roles that didn't make any sense and went anywhere, nor a conclusion a story, anything,I would never understand the love for this film, it is so overrated. 1/10"
3 April 2005,ljcjpjlj,0,1,8,"Highly enjoyable non-stop action, fun, silliness, twisted and perverted.","Having seen both of the Kill Bill movies, and having enjoyed their extreme entertainment value, I decided to see Tarantino's earlier Pulp Fiction. This film, filled with the ""f"" word and the ""n"" word and all manner of profanity (enough to make a sailor blush)and obscenity (who really cares), is a highly entertaining and cartoonish, mish mash of stories, plots and subplots centering about a gang of varied characters featuring drug dealers, dopers, perverts, rednecks, gangsters, murderers, bullies, victims, and all their blood, guts, violence, stupidity, and even a smattering of religion. What Tarantino has done here with his cast of wild characters is cover all the bases, providing non-stop entertainment and excitement for the viewer who is able to suspend his disbelief and disconnect from reality long enough to last until the head-scratcher that comes when the film runs out. (The story really doesn't end; I think Tarantino just ran out of time!) This is a great vehicle for the ever-familiar and versatile John Travolta. Samuel Jackson is a great and lovable baddest-type bad guy. I loved Harvey Keitel's cameo. Don't look for a lot of reality here, but enjoy the exaggerated realism. I found lots of laughs (it's easily as funny and silly as Kill Bill 1), lots of gore, lots of nice guns, strange twists, and enough time warps to want to see it again just to get things straightened out."
9 March 2014,Khutxo,1,1,7,Very Nice!,"It is an exhilaration from beginning to end. It's the movie equivalent of that rare sort of novel where you find yourself checking to see how many pages are left and hoping there are more, not fewer. The first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation...gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud. I think Quentin Tarantino is genius; his writing and directing were extraordinary, outstanding performances from all cast members, all made Pulp Fiction a classic masterpiece. One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favourites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances."
10 March 2014,evanreakes,1,1,10,Favorite movie,"Three renowned actors and my favorite director, Quentin Tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. The amazing actor, Samuel Jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. In addition, John Travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. Moreover, John McCain plays a boxer who doesn't take the fall. Not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout Pulp Fiction. There's no dull moments in Tarantino's finest work. The story takes the viewer on ride through drug, deception, murder, and everywhere in between. I'm a little bias towards Jackson and Tarantino, but for any movie lover this is a must watch."
27 January 2005,rewaFDF,1,2,10,Probably the most well written movie of the past few decades.,"'Pulp Fiction' was one of the best films of the '90s. With it's superb performances, and a masterfully told story, through flashbacks and a plot that has more twists and turns than any English country lane, pulp fiction remains and shall ever be a fine piece of work.Tarantino's blend of so many different styles of music, ranging from the likes of Dusty Springfield and Chuck Berry, mixed with the visceral characters of everyday life, makes it a delight to watch again and again.There are some spectacular moments, like Butch's surprise when he sees Marcellus at a traffic light. What follows is the best bits of the movie. With a jerky hand-held camera we move from the car crash into a random shop where the owner knocks out Butch, after he knocks out Marcellus.A key theme follows when Butch escapes, redemption. Butch goes back with a samurai sword to free Marcellus and himself of being in Marcellus's debt.What's my verdict? If you haven't seen this film, then you haven't lived"
10 January 2007,diannndra,1,3,10,The one that opens the door for any others,"Many say this movie is overrated, many hate this movie very much, and many walk out of cinema before it's even finished. But, like it or not, Pulp Fiction opens the door for other movies that contains one or more of its formulas to either be enjoyable, or have higher rating, or be looked cool, or even be popular. Those formulas are: (I cannot mention all of them)1) Short Stories Plots. Pulp Fiction is just like a book that contains short stories where each has their own plot. All the stories are connected one to another by the similarity of characters and incidents. There are stories of a couple who wanted to rob a restaurant, a gangster's wife and a hit-man's trip, two hit men's silly experience, and a runaway boxer hunted by gangster. They all happens around the gangster's environment. The time line of those stories doesn't have to be time wise, which means the story that happens first doesn't have to be the first to be told. Maybe Pulp Fiction is not the first movie, but later, many movie uses this kind of plot and become successful. There are Amores Perros, Babel, Antares, Sin City, Kill Bill, Intermission, The Dead Girl, Berbagi Suami, and many others with their own variation. Later, one of the variations called 'post-modern plot'. Maybe they don't have any intention to use the same formula or they doesn't even inspired by Pulp Fiction, for example, Chungking Express launched a little bit sooner than Pulp Fiction. But, it is Pulp Fiction who opens the door for them, it makes easier for others to be enjoyable.2)Many stories with different Point of View. In each of its stories, Pulp Fiction has a point of view of the third person (audience) that follows the main character. This kind of formula was already popular in the novel, long time before Pulp Fiction, Jeffrey Archer and even Sydney Sheldon wrote this kind of point of view. After Pulp Fiction, many popular movies use the same formula successfully, like The Hours, Crash, 21 grams, Syriana, Traffic, and many others including those're mentioned before. Again, Pulp Fiction just opens the door. 3)Satire to violence. Pulp Fiction is a satire to violence. Quentin Tarantino has always been making satire to violence movies, even sooner when he wrote True Romance a year before. He always makes violence look funny in a dark way, to some people who can enjoy it. After Pulp Fiction, there are movies like Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Cidade de Seus, Brick, Shawn of the Dead, Desperado, etc. 4)Independent Spirit. It is true that Stanley Kubrick has made indie movie long long time before Pulp Fiction. But, Independent Movies have never looked that cool before Pulp Fiction, and later, all the Kubrick's are looked even cooler than before.I love Pulp Fiction. Even it might not be my number 1 movie, but I have a great great respect and appreciation for it."
15 March 2007,Azrael269,0,1,10,Top of the top,"This film is about three days in the lives of several shady characters. It is divided into four sub-stories, each focusing on one of four incidents that involve drugs, assassinations and divine intervention. The characters' lives interact at various points, mostly without one knowing that the other is also currently involved with a very important event.Suffice to say that this comment could go on for days but to cut a long story short, what one needs to know before they watch this film is that it is probably the sickest, funniest black comedy of all time. A combination of impossible coincidences in the lives of a gangster (Rhames), his wife (Thurman), his lackeys (Travolta and Jackson), a paid-off boxer (Willis), a couple of petty thieves (Roth and Plummer), a drug-dealer (Stoltz) and a man who solves problems (Keitel).The humour of this film is sublime. There is exaggeration at every single detail, whether it comes to picking up pieces of skull and brain or hick homosexual rapist policemen. There are drugs and/or drug references in almost every scene and that leads to several particular scenes of ""high"" artistic expression. Every single line is calculated and the characters of a movie have never been more alive, vibrant and decadently hilarious.The film evolves rapidly, with each twist making the situation more and more bizarre and exaggerated. Included in this downhill of events is a strange suitcase that has been the topic of numerous internet forums in over a decade. Plainly put, this is a movie by a talented director at, what was for some, the peak of his creativity, with an extravagant cast that many would feel envious of, a captivating, ever-twisting storyline and incredible, macabre gangster humour. Definitely an epic, this film is probably a landmark that simply cannot be equaled by its creator or any of his contemporaries."
2 July 2006,iam_moriya,0,3,10,One of the best there is,"I don't like John Travolta. Every movie with his name on it works for me as a ""big red signal flag."" It's not that I think he is a bad actor. Not at all. But he does bad movies. In his best times all he did was musicals, and I hate musicals. Nowadays he plays the bad guy in bad movies. But there is no rule without exception. And in Travoltas case that is a huge exception: Pulp Fiction.I hadn't seen this movie but I wanted to when my friend allowed me to lend it from him. I watched it and I really, really enjoyed it.The movie is, like the title says, simply pulp fictions. A lot of stories set in the same universe with lovely characters and, as usual when Quentin is around, great dialog. During this film we get to hear interesting conversations about hamburgers, foot massage, pot belly's and how you can rob a bank with a cell phone. Don't try the last one though since it is in fact, well, illegal.Thanks to this one and Reservoir Dog I consider myself a Quentin Tarantino fan. The man knows how to make smart and entertaining movies by mixing everything that made him want to become a director in the first place. Some would call it original but if you ask me it's simply how the business works. Here's a movie that started a revolution when it came out. If you haven't watched it this should be the #1 on your have to watch list.""Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack."" - Vincent Vega"

A great movie by all standards amazing performance, direction, music and soundtracks and the funny story which was had a lot of twists on it."

20 May 2005,daz313,1,2,10,Tarantino hits jackpot with this work of art,"pulp fiction is by far the best film to have ever hit this world... if you don't have it then i recommend that you GET it. Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis and John Travolta are by far the best actors and to have them all in the same movie just tops it off... if this ain't the best movie.. then what is? if this movie hasn't got the best cast.. then what has? AMAZING FILM, AMAZING CAST, AMAZING DIRECTOR.. what has this film not got? If you thought steven spielberg was the best then you were wrong, if you thought spielbergs movies were better then you were wrong - WHY? because Tarantino's got style and his reputation for his cool movies was built."
15 October 2019,Akodi,0,1,6,Not as good as I remember,"Like most people who saw this when it first came out I have fond memories of this and viewed it as a masterpiece.Unfortunately, watching it many years later I found the dialogue to drag on and on unnecessarily and so many of the situations to be poor excuses to use swear words, edgy racial humour or violence that tries too hard.Interesting how the story all comes together but Tarantino certainly makes you wait a loooong time before getting to the point"
6 January 2018,dmfox77,1,3,6,I recently watched this movie again which brings my rating much higher.,"The movie is shot in a kind of choppy method and I really don't like that kind of direction but all in all it's actually not too bad of a film. The scenes are not done from start to finish style like most movies are shot which is what I usually prefer but it is a bit refreshing to see a movie shot in different time sequences meaning some of the scenes later in the movie are what happened before in the story line, you may need to see this film two or three times to understand it all but it was a fairly good movie. I think Quentin Tarantino is a bit over raved about, he's a decent story writer and director but from my experience not all that glitters is gold."
26 August 2019,doutorskreta,1,2,10,It remains my favorite!,"Every moment counts. All scenes are attractive. The soundtrack is perfect. The camera is in the right place.
But the best is the text.
The worst: being unrepeatable. The search for something of this quality will be endless.
This movie definitely ignited my passion for cinema.
25 years later, the passion is gone, but the love goes on."
4 March 2021,jtrushant,0,2,6,A perfectly good movie.,"Samuel L Jackson makes this movie worth watching. His scenes are the best. Rest of the cast is also good but some of the scenes really drag on.
Story is not told in order, but it all comes full circle in the end. There are many shocking moments throughout. Ironically the worst actor in the movie is Tarantino. But his direction and dialogues are great."

                        ",good but over-rated,"This movie has a legendary reputation. But I don't see why. It was smart,witty,charming in it's own way,and a fun movie,but it's not a work of genius. The constant jumping back and forth in time is really confusing. I've watched this movie I know at least 10 times,and still can not figure out what takes place when. And WHAT is in that briefcase? Someone once said it was someone's soul. Which raises a bunch of other questions. I see this as an ok movie,but incredibly over-hyped,and I think way too much has been read into it."

                        ",The Highlight of our Arbitrary Occurrence,"Pulp Fiction is merely a stage of randomness accentuated by ironies and goofs intertwining the roles each brilliant actor in it plays, not as a specific person. But as normal people. It was with a sense of quirky, cynical normality void of the formulaic prosaicness in cliché action flicks, that Director Quentin Tarrantino instigated the production, and hence boosted his fame into a household name of Pulp Fiction. Each actor plays a strong mental part in a precarious and cavernous compilation of events, which in a formulaic sense of direction would conclude idyllically with the bad guys locked away and the good guys grinning ear to ear.. But here's the ingenious twist to it.. There are no 'good guys' in the film! With witty mockery in his tone, good camera angles and blundered events, Quentin Tarrantino presents us with a cast of people who appear perfectly normal and then twist on a downward, devilish spiral. Simply said, Quentin Tarrantino castigates the formulaic 'good guy' in cheap action flicks with solid good to bad guy transitions inherent in each one of the most memorable cast of actors of the '90s. Tim Roth's Ringo and Amanda Plummer's Yolanda are just two characters whose quirky discussion at an average bar paves their identities from good to evil as Ringo deduces that robbing a coffee shop can be just as lucrative and more subtle than a bank heist. The last scene of the movie plays brilliantly to this effect as Jules and Vincent alleviate the situation. Quentin Tarrantino beautifully intertwines the story of Jules and Vincent in the coffee shop heist by showing us their random discussion of hamburgers and their translations overseas. Their stories along with the dazzling choreography of Mia and Vincent at a Saturday Night restaurant sets a stage of purely inspired abnormality. In order not to give away the rest of the plot of the film which has been generally known and globally discussed since the year of its release, I will cut my comment short by saying that if you wish to see anomalous directing, decked with a cast that is anything but incompetent, see this now.."

Quentin Tarantino is a brilliant filmmaker. I am only one of three people that I know that actually liked this movie and I love that I have my own opinion about it. People have been so harsh to this movie because they don't like that a filmmaker came out of nowhere to make a film that actually wasn't afraid to say it like it is. I recommend it to everybody but not everybody will like it...Bravo to Tarantino, Thurman, Travolta and Jackson!!!"

21 May 2020,tobiashjelmseth,6,19,1,Possibly the worst movie I've ever watched,"This movie has one of the best ratings in the world, but it just doesn't make any sense. For 3 hours straight I forced myself through this wack of a movie, and I'm left with a feeling of disappoint and anger. The plot is absolute s*it, it's like watching a TV-show where 95% of the episodes are fillers and random, unnecessary conversations. Literally 2,5/3 hours is random s*it happening, and really f*cking boring conversations that feels completely unrelated to the story. Somhow, I guess this movie managed to brainwash an entire population, because it just does. not. make. any sense as to why anyone would ever rate this move a 10/10. It's like they saw the name of the actors and the director, and just instantly decided it would be a 10/10 regardless of how the actual plot was. Watching this movie is like sitting at a restaurant, staring into the wall and overhearing a mid-40s couple's conversation for 3 hours straight. I do not fathom what anyone sees in this 3-hour-long torture of a movie, and I most definitely would never in my life recommend this movie. In fact, I'd rather recommend you to continuously hit your head into a wall for 3 hours instead of watching this."
2 October 2001,justinf-3,0,1,10,One of the greatest films ever made,"This film is a classic. And its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp, snappy, humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so, that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again. By now, i've seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up. I won't go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say, you can download the script from the Net and it literally jumps out at you. Its an incredible read. Now if the script is THAT good, no wonder Travolta and Keitel wanted to do it. An awesome film - the No.1 film ever made in my estimation."

                        ","Audacious, Iconoclastic, with Vitality to Spare!","One of the best movies of the 1990s is probably the most unique in the sense that it stands by itself in its audacity and vitality.  Quentin Tarantino is an auteur of the 90s and has proven a masterful director for great ensemble casts, an insightful well-developed script, inspiring and striking camera angles and cinematography, and has developed a new genre of gangsters, crime, and mystery with an array of violence, drugs, sex, and fast-paced action.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dynamic and deliver powerful performances as a duo of hitmen, Bruce Willis is compelling (in one of his finest roles) as a prize-fighter and struggling boxer, and Uma Thurman is memorable as a sexy drug addict.  All these lowlifes are connected in one way or another to big time mafia leader Ving Rhames who happens to be Thurman's husband.  Movie is also unique in the sense that it is broken up into different scenes that don't seem to go in order from beginning to end.  Obviously the movie is not for all tastes for its dehumanizing and repulsive theme which is evident in every single scene. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Pulp Fiction is a mezmerising ride.  9/10"

Jackson is one of my favorite actors because he is one of the most believable actors in Hollywood. John Travolta is great in his role as Vince Vega. His classic ""Royal with Cheese"" line still makes me laugh. Quentin Tarantino ties this movie in perfectly with the first scene of the movie becomes the last scene of the movie. WHich is pretty clever because there is a lot of STUFF that happens in between the first and the last scene.BOTTOM LINE: 10/10 - THis movie is amazing except the part were Ving Rahmes gets raped, it is just wrongfully disturbing!!!

I was blown with the thoughts, the screenplay, the comedy, the performance and what not? This has surpassed the list of movies that are beyond ratings.

7 July 2010,tomreves,0,2,8,Not too deep but brilliantly entertaining,"Quentinn Tarantino at his best. ""Pulp fiction"" is the best picture Tarantino has ever made.

The success of bringing all those talented actors, such as Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, John Travolta and many other, together to make this brilliant movie was worth to do.

After you see the movie, you will know exactly what I am referring to, and you will understand my anger. There is so much to be said about this movie, there is not room here. The dialogue is perfect, the 'out of order' arrangement of the scenes keeps you interested and wondering, and most of the casting is unbelieveable. John Travolta steals the show, and is the most surprising and wonderful thing to come out of this movie. Bruce Willis overacts a bit (quite a bit actually), and Uma Thuman doesn't act enough, and to me seems like she is just struggling to remember and recite the lines. In fact, I haven't seen any movies she has been good in, except for ""The Golden Bowl"" where she was unexpectedly good. Other than the performances by Bruce and Uma, this movie is one of the best ever!"
1 December 2012,CristiRojas12,0,1,10,An experience that can be enjoyed again and again,"The lives of two hit men, a boxer, a drug dealer's wife and two bandits intertwined through different stories ... that tells Quentin Tarantino in his film Pulp Fiction (1994), which deals with violence and redemption.It's a strong story, told through different chapters, which illustrate each of the stories, and as the film progresses from chapter to chapter the viewer is all intertwined. And tell the story that way works, because many things we do not understand or that leave doubts are resolved in the end.The dialogue makes the audience journey through history, and the dialogue is very dense, but it helps the narrative of the story because it gives the necessary information and maintains the expectation of what comes next.Throughout the story we see the characters follow their own interests and seek its benefits, although some are blackmailed to act in certain ways. They want revenge and achieve their goals through violence, but realize that it does not always bring happiness, so try to redeem himself, but not always in the right way.It's a film that puts the characters into bizarre and dangerous situations, and when they escape enter some worse, this in the context of crime and intrigue. So nothing is predictable, no one knows what will happen next and kept the tension from beginning to end.The story moves quickly through dialogue, which tells us what is necessary to move the story forward, it shows that it is a movie that is not based on real life and that the director saw many films in which he was inspired to do this because it shows people and situations that are not ordinary, and tells it with a cold manner and a style that is not very common.All together, accompanied by good performances, it becomes an experience that can be enjoyed again and again."
26 October 2014,DodsworthMcgillicutty,0,2,6,Doesn't last.,"Hate to say, ""Pulp Fiction"" had brilliant bits, but back in 1994 opening day, had sky high hopes and left with minor disappointment. Solid reasons: excessive pop culture references, Bruce Willis girlfriend, too many awkward slacker supporting roles, far too many homages got distracting. Watched it 2 weeks ago (2014), and scenes are actually embarrassing from not aging well, specifically the entire Jack Rabbit Slims bit. Juvenile. For some reason, my Favorite bit is actually the dialogue free long take of Bruce Willis hiking to his apt for the watch, the confrontation, and driving away listening to Flowers on the Wall. Also, the Blu Ray is too clear. I almost prefer this specific title in VHS or Laserdisc, not digitally cleaned up, more muddy. Harsh light Cinematography is bad, no wonder QT tossed him. This is dated. The impact is softened, due on some part to it being lifted by 100's of filmmakers. Within the same year, there was Fugitive, Schindler, Shawshank - none of which were as ballsy, but they're not dated, shot great. Even 1984's Repo Man is less dated, similar vibe, more groundbreaking IMO. QT never gives Repo Man's Alex Cox credit, and seemed to take off where Cox left off after being booted from Hollywood."
18 August 2014,ayushman-iitk,1,1,10,"awesome movie with an awesome direction, acting and plot","The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of Hollywood cinema. It was released on 14th October 1995 and maintains its position #5 in IMDb's top 250 list ever since. The great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested. It revolves around the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.. The thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman. This movie has some great all time favorite dialog like ""I dare you, I double dare you"" and many more. The music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested.Coming to the composition of the movie, the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed. The movie starts from present, goes into the past, then jumps to future and comes back to the present. This is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused.Coming to awards and nominations, it won an Oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture, best actor, best actor in the supporting role, best director and many more. Overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an Oscar which is a sign of great movie.So I would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plot,acting and direction and one should watch it at least once."
21 June 2005,fatleprechan,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction changed the way cinema looked at movie dialogue,"Writer and director Quentin Tartentino reportedly worked in a video store for a time. No doubt it was during this period when he decided he'd had his fill of formulated and prosaic conversations between actors. And contrived plots which plodded towards unsatisfying finales wrought with gunfire and unnecessary explosions. You will find no such nonsense in Tarentino's masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction' With a complex and extremely entertaining plot, which is filmed out of sequence, a device which sometimes confuses audiences. Not here as the whole thing plays out and comes together like a puzzle which everyone is having a lot of fun putting together. It is the story of a boxing fix. two handgun wielding robbers and two hit men all interwoven together and connecting at some point. But the most amazing thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. The actors talk about normal everyday things, not just points to move along the plot or set up a conclusion. A good example of this occurs early in the film while the two hit men, played by John Travolta in his Academy Award nominated come back roll as Vince Vega, and Samuel L. Jackson, also nominated for Hollywood's biggest prize, as Jules, the second of the contract killers, are driving in a car on their way to an ordered murder. They begin talking about Vega's recent trip to Europe. There is a reference to various fast food restaurants. And Vega comments that because of the metric system in France the Quarter Pounder at McDonald's is called a Royal with cheese. The ease at which the actors speak the dialogue freely helps to create a realistic atmosphere where it seems like two people are just talking. Someone might say that two men on their way to a brutal execution might not be on the subject of fast food. But who's to say where normal or abnormal conversation might lead. Tarentino caught on to this before anyone else. And this is the most ingenious thing about the film. That and the fact that the scenes are funny, original and thrilling all at the same time. The film also has fine performances from Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis among others. But none better than Jackson, who's roll as the repentant hit man developing a conscience wasthe breakout part this tremendous American actor needed to finally achieve the recognition he deserves. He is comical and reverent in his newfound religion all at the same time. Also look for Harvey Kietel, in a swell cameo as 'The Wolf' a man called in to clean up messes which you can't tidy up yourself After this film came out, many imitators cropped up and tried to copy Tarentino's writing style. Along with his obsession with 70s black exploitation films and karate movies. But this film is positively one of a kind. It could easily be the best film of its decade. Groundbreaking. 10 out of a possible 10 T.H."

John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play their characters phenomenally, and they work really well together. Also there's so many memorable lines in the film. Director Quentin Tarantino adds to the list of great movies by executing another spectacular film. This movie is a real one of a kind type of film, well I believe at least. Uma Thurman does a stunning job, she brought an entire new aspect to her character, her character seems very independent and is quite likable.

It wasn't found for nearly two decades, when two cops happened on a pair of kids stripping an older car. After running the Vehicle Identification Number, they found it shared the number with a car in Oakland, which turned out to be Tarantino's car."

24 April 2022,GriffSwag,3,5,6,Boring (especially when compared with expectation),"This is a very boring movie. The way that the storyline is cut up into 4 different parts makes the movies feel all very disconnected. The film basically just showcases the lives of your average mobster type criminals. Many people say that the ""everyday life"" kind of feel of the movie is what makes it great; I say very plainly that this is what makes it dull. It certainly a well made movie, this is why I give it 6 and not less."

21 March 2020,Swatikamra,0,0,8,Interesting Movie,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."

He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy.

                        ","Great, great movie","This is one of the best movies ever, made by one of my favorite writer/directors ever, Quintin Tarantino. This movie has no plot. It is completely story telling, kind of like the movie Smoke, but with better stories. These stories just happen to involve the same people. They don't always go in chronological order, but that doesn't matter. You have to realize each story is not supposed to be connected. Also, this movie isn't about gangsters or gangs or the mafia. It offers no insight into that lifestyle and is not supposed to. It is very far from reality, no gangsters are this eloquent and interesting and quirky. The characters in the stories just happen to be criminals.Also, this movie is not violent at all. People may disagree because of the Marvin scene, but you DO NOT see him get shot, you only see what happened afterwards. I guess people think that is violence. There is a lot of humor in this movie, in words and in actions. For instance when Butch, (Bruce Willis) goes back to save Marsellus, he is choosing his weapon of destruction in the pawn shop. He picks up various items ranging in killing power, such as a bat, a chainsaw,etc. He finally decides on a Samuri sword. All in all, an excellent movie."
8 August 1999,Axel Fox,1,2,10,The Ultimate Movie,"To me this movie has it all, a great premise, a clever script, and a wonderful storyteller in Tarantino. The acting is superb, but truly it didn't even need to be all that great. With so many lines which will be repeated long after you see this movie, it is pretty much an instant classic.I've seen Pulp Fiction more times than I can count (Probably about 50) and it's the only film that I can still get joy out of after seeing it that many times. I was terribly confused as to what transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film isn't that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the ""Big brain on Brad"" scene until the ""Bad Mother F--ker"" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but since we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into one, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.Unfortunately this will probably be Tarantino's last great film judging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown."
25 October 2014,Pagrant-142-166059,1,1,10,"Four stories, one great film.","John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson at their best.Four stories, one great film.The small time robbers (Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer), The gangsters (John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson), The gangsters' wife (Uma Thurman), The boxer (Bruce Willis & Ving Rhames).In my opinion Quentin Tarantino's best film.You will need to watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate just how good it is. You will see something new each time you watch it.The dialogue is natural, convincing and witty. there are so many great characters in this film it difficult to pick any one. The main characters in all four stories give excellent performances but so do the supporting characters, such as the drug dealer and his girlfriend, The shop owner and police officer, Harvey Keitel as the Wolf, Christopher Walken as Captain Koons."

6 November 2014,ThinnerThanLizzy,1,1,10,A wonderful concoction of wacky misadventures,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" not only is a fantastic achievement in film making, it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream Hollywood film. A complex tale of murder, humor and odd characters, suffused with pop-culture references, sharp and witty dialog, fantastic acting, a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly. There are faults, as in every film, scattered here and there, but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts. There is very little else that can be said about this film, as everyone and their mothers has seen it, hopefully not together! ""Bring out the gimp."" I envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and I urge you to do so. Right now!"

                        ",crazy style,"Although I found this movie very confusing I still really enjoyed it and found it amusing. I could never get the story line straight...it didn't really follow in a chronological sequence, but the acting and writing i this film mad up for it. The dialogue in this film was very sharp and laugh out loud funny at times. Travolta and Jackson play two of the best hit men I have ever seen in a movie. I also think Uma Thurman played the part of the boss's wife perfectly. I think this film also showed a different side to Bruce Willis. He is usually typecast as an action hero, but in this movie he was shown as more than just that. I have never seen a Tarantino movie before, but after watching this I have decided that I will change that because I like his style. Usually I would be put off by the plot not being easy to follow, but I think it adds to the craziness and style of this film."
11 July 2013,s13ky,0,1,8,Tarantino cleverly mixed suspense and action with black humor at its best.,"Pulp Fiction is such a wonderful movie because everything is great in it. The narrative structure is perfect, it's puzzle-like and divided into chapters, in which all the details fit perfectly because of the painstaking work of Tarantino (there are so many details, that for many times you see the film you will always find something new). These chapters are not even exposed in a chronologically ordered, forcing the viewer to put the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe. We should also note the mind-blowing staging, the flashbacks, the endless film references to other cult films (including Reservoir Dogs), the players, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, making it a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that will be remembered. Pulp Fiction can also be seen as an icon because since its release in 1994, no films were able to deliver more than pay homage to films of similar style but much lower, of course. Quentin Tarantino showed the world that he possesses the powerful wit he visualizes within each minute of this 2,5 hour-film. The cast is also excellent, (who does not know John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman?) With some brilliant performances like above, everything is amazing in Pulp Fiction. Tarantino cleverly mixed suspense and action with black humor at its best. Furthermore, the idea of ​​combining three stories altering the thread of the narrative was risky but he made it. If the amount of times you see a film determines its value then it is clear that Pulp Fiction is definitely the movie of my life."
5 July 2014,LoganWeasel,0,1,8,Tarantino does it again,"I think pulp fiction is a strange movie but don't take that in a wrong way because its very well made and intriguing plot, i think Samuel.L.Jackson's acting is one of the many acting highlights of the film along with Bruce Willis's role this is an odd one out of the bunch without a doubt it has a longer running time than most films but the plot,acting,and productcion quality of the film make up for it,for anyone that's familiar with Tarantino knows how interesting the visuals are in the film they have a specific look to them and i like the different angled shots made in the film i think this is one of the greatest he's made so far,but in conclusion pulp fiction is a great Tarantino film that should be appreciated more than it is and definitely is a odd but wonderful film"

Not only does it exceed by far the up to then set cliches, but it also sets such itself! A must for everyone, who thinks he knows something 'bout movies & for everyone, who thinks he might make a good director, when he grows up. Notice, that Pulp Fiction DID restore the fading shine of actors like Travolta & Bruce Willis, and DID make Samuel L. Jackson famous. A fine lesson about how to NOT urge the audience leave their seats in the midst of everything as some modern ""cult"" directors do."

21 August 2013,BubbaButterfly,1,1,10,Pulp Fiction(1994),"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever.

But in the end where all of them are supposed to connect and somehow you get the meaning of the movie they just doesn't as expected!

15 May 2019,hotelholidayy,0,0,8,WOW,"I personally really enjoyed this film and enjoyed watching Samuel L Jackson kick some serious ass. It was one of those films where in a sense you're rooting for the bad guys and its totally ok. A line that that keeps resonating in my head is ""you know you're comfortable with someone when you can enjoy silence with them"" and I feel that"
31 May 2000,lozkko,1,2,10,"The ""film noir"" is alive and kicking. Thanks Quentin.","If you are sick and tired of the pathetic Holliwood crime movie- full of special effects but overall repetitive and with poor characterization and sense of humor-this is the movie you have got to watch. Quentin doesn't shoot this movie simply because he wants to provide us good entertainment, but also because he wants to pay a tribute to the great tradition of films noir. And he does this in an impeccable way. In Pulp Fiction the bad guys are nastier than ever before, and even the police are given to pure brutality ( cannot say more, watch it). The camera work is probably the best I have ever seen for a variety of reasons. First of all Tarantino uses a hyper-sensitive camera film which has the effect of making the colors brighter , so that the characters and the setting seem really to belong to a pulp book. Besides some scenes, such as the one of the injection, are very ingenuous and original, and I really appreciated such creativity especially vis-a-vis the repetitiveness of many modern crime movies. Finally, the non-linear plot of pulp fiction is simply amazing. WIth its numerous flash-backs and flash-forwards it contributes to keep your adrenaline high (especially in light of the fact that until two-third of the movie it is very hard to follow the plot), but at the end everything pieces together and you feel as content as when you solve a Rubrik's cube. As far as the acting is concerned, this is also of very high quality since all the actors seem very convincing (particularly John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis), and they manage to alternate ultra violent parts with very humorous lines ( Do I look like a bitch? Then why are you trying to f**k me like a bitch) Overall, I rate Pulp FIction as 9.5, 10 . Not only it is the best movie by Tarantino but probably one of the best film noir ever."
29 June 2000,mstino,1,2,10,Pulsating Energy Built on the Details,"When I first watched PULP FICTION I was completely controlled by its energy. Tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like Pepe-la-Peu was lead by the scent of perfume.I have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie.  The big picture (the basic stories, the characters, the situations that bring them together) is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient.  Yet, Tarantino threw in details that you wouldn't notice were placed on purpose.  For example, listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing.  Notice that the reason Mia OD'd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon.  Tarantino set that scene up subtley in Lance's bedroom almost an hour before the OD.Many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made.  In PULP FICTION, Tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the details."
19 April 2019,danwin-14834,0,0,8,A excellent classic,"So much has been already said about this film and its fantastic qualities, the dialogue is funny and scarily realistic, the performances and hilarious and tense; it truly holds up to this day and is a must see."
11 August 1999,umainer,0,0,10,A Modern Day Canterbury Tale,"Geoffrey Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" was a frame story:  there was one overall story/link that binded all the characters (they met at the inn on the road) which is at the beginning and end of the story but in between are mini-stories about each of the travellers.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is a modern version.  The frame in this case is the Diner which is where, like Chaucer's inn, the main characters meet.  In between we get mini-story's like Butch's tale (the Knight if you will), Vincent's tale (the Sailor) and Jules' tale (the Monk).  Each is interwoven with the other except that chronologically, they are out of synch (Butch wastes Vincent in his tale but Vincent is in the Diner frame part of the story).  The dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--Tarintino is notorious, like Stephen King, for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references.  Witness the scene outside Jack Rabbit Slims where Mia asks Vincent ""You're not a square Daddy-O are you?"" and proceeds to ""draw"" a square in the air ala Pebbles Flintstone.  This blurring of the film's reality with our reality lets you know Tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense of what ""Joe Bagofdonuts"" does--he watches TV too!  Kevin Williamson's re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to ""Pulp Fiction"" and it's acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days.  Rent it, buy it... the bonus cut footage alone is worth a look."
27 January 2015,jhcaldas,1,1,10,Love this movie!,"Well directed, well produced, love the photography, and the script is amazing. Quentin Tarantino is one of my preferred directors, and the Pulp Fiction was the first film from Tarantino that made me start looking different for this director's work. The arc of this script is super well created, once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie. The photography of this movie is also amazing, very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie. The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast. About Tarantino's direction, there nothing that I can tell ... in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax, at the right moment. One of the best movies I have ever seen."

10 April 2021,gkylek,3,10,4,Self-indulgent faux art,"This film that displays Tarantino's skills and excesses in equal measure, but it is clear that there's no purpose or raison d'etre behind it. It's just a film of scenes forced to work together to defend a kind of plot, but really it's just a series of McGuffins that don't provide interest or satisfaction.Tarantino makes films that a talented middle schooler could make, but as an adult, he should show more discernment. Several scenes are brilliant and engaging, but the film could be significantly improved by judicious editing. The film is at least 45 minutes too long, which makes me think the auteur has nobody telling him ought to say no to some of his ideas.I rewatched Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" the previous night, which plays like a tight-scripted Mamet screenplay compared to this wandering, pointless disaster.Note that most of the reviews of 9 or 10 don't actually supply any reasons for their review - they are just repeating the all-too-common trope that Tarantino is a genius. Maybe he is, but his films don't show us he has any discernment. Art is achieved NOT when there's nothing left to add, when there's nothing that can be taken away without damaging the whole."

20 December 2007,kylekool150,0,1,10,"With all simplicity, arguably the best film ever made.","I'll keep it short, but sweet.Pulp Fiction will always remain a classic to me, abiding the rest of my days. It is perpetually entertaining in every aspect. To both film fans and general and fans of the very admirable crime-drama genre. Fans of crime-dramas will love the intricate plot, which is executed with both a brilliant screenplay, and enjoyable performances by the film's actors.The direction and film-editing is very skillful throughout the film. As if the script, story and characters weren't absorbing enough, the film also has such exquisite production values as well. Which basically is the icing on the cake.Anybody under 18, I believe should see this film, regardless of the content. It is a very intelligent film, that can easily trance you into the crime genre. Without delivering to many plot details or spoilers to my fellow readers of this review. I will simply say, you must see the film and experience it's complex plot for yourself, and put the pieces together. It'll make for a much more enjoyable experience."
12 February 2003,STFU,0,1,10,"Great film, but not at the top","Some people love Pulp Fiction, and some people loathe it.  I feel that it is a well made movie that truly deserved an Oscar for best writing.  However, I don't feel that this movie is the blockbuster event to end all movies, and that Tarantino is a movie god for making it.  No.  It is funny, it is satirical, the actors make very good performances, but frankly, it is just a movie.  Now I do believe it belongs in IMDB's top 250, probably even the top 50, it's good, but no masterpiece.  Although if it weren't for people like Samuel L. Jackson or Christopher Walken acting in this movie, it probably would have been regarded as some wannabe ""new age"" style of movie.  However because Jackson delivered such a strong performance, and Walken's Cameo was so seriously hilarious, this movie does get to be in a genre of its own."

The dialogue is great, there are many famous actors that nail their performances, and Tarantino's techniques are great. Good story line with the right amount of action and storyline. Great film. One of the best things that helps this film succeed is in the way it is told. The scenes jump around as in Quentin Tarantino's other movies. The story is told from a couple different perspectives which is good. This movie also has an amazing soundtrack. The music alone is enough to see this film. Travolta and Jackson nail their performances so well, they are very believable. Go see Reservoir Dogs, by Quentin Tarantino, as well because you will like that if you liked this one (but this is definitely better)."

9 March 2015,OutlanderOmega,0,0,9,The Manic Beauty of the Wacky MacGuffin Conundrum,"When I was a kid, I had worlds and settings I'd come up with in my head. They were thrown together from different things in movies, music, and pictures. It was how I thought a sci-fi world should be. How I thought a forest of tribal people should look. These were all made of many different ideas, but there was one that wasn't fully formed. It was what I thought of when I saw the neon sign for a burger place by the old Hollywood video store. It had brightly colored jungle leaves and the light of the words. It wasn't a complete idea, but I knew it was electric, bright, lush, and most of all interesting. Pulp Fiction was the embodiment of this. It was an interesting story that was one of the single most entertaining movies I've ever seen.Though it's considered a sin, I haven't seen much Tarantino. In fact, the only other one I've seen is Inglorious Basterds. So, I'd like to compare it directly to that. Pulp Fiction hit the proverbial mark on every aspect of cinematography, visual style, production design, and interesting shots. The first scene in Inglorious Basterds with the Jews under the floor was supposed to be tense, but dragged on to where it wasn't suspenseful. However, the scene where Vincent and Mia go to Jack Rabbit Slim's was great. As well as how they had an interesting conversation, the camera wasn't left to hang out while the crew went for a smoke break. The shot composition was changed up enough to keep an already good interaction more fun to watch. This constant flow of change-ups doesn't confuse the audience either, but keeps it interesting through every scene (save maybe Butch's flashback).Thematically, this movie is great. There's a lot to do with the idea of honor, but what was interesting to me is how ethics played in. Living in Seattle, I don't hear lots of conversations in public that go beyond people saying they don't know if they believe in God, but just want to accept everybody for all the stuff they think and stuff, man. Pulp Fiction doesn't struggle with that kind debate. They talk about God right at the start to move into a deeper ethical issue. It's proof that a movie doesn't have to be confusing or psychologically challenging to make you contemplate huge concepts. The content of a movie is not necessarily being promoted by its makers. This movie about killers, thieves, rapists, and addicts had more to say about morals and redemption than the boring Eastern philosophy that suffocates discussions on belief. Those discussions rarely happen where I'm from and it's something all people are interested by.Sometimes when watching a movie I say, ""damn, that's why people love this."" A moment that makes the film worthy of its credit. I felt that was every single scene in Pulp Fiction. It had enough energy and information, both thematic and visual, to fill an insane asylum. There are few things I love more in a story than when they approach serious, dark situations with a who-cares attitude. Pulp Fiction did this amazingly, but without making the characters amoral or apathetic. This film had the entertainment drive of District 9 and the Graduate. After a long wait to see it, I was impressed."
12 May 2020,mariow2015,0,0,9,Iconic Film of Tarantino,"I personally loved this movie, as having never seen it before but heard plenty about it. I've heard of it a lot in pop culture as a controversial but very famous movie, I can see why after watching it. The photography and performances from the actors are exquisite, and the writing is very witty and well done. The overall plot of the movie is outstanding, but the overall rollaecoaster of this movie is what made it so good. One minute it's moody and dark, the next it's comedy, and the next it's bloody and gore-y. It's definitely for mature audiences with repeated use of drugs and nudity, but this is one of my overall favorites from the 90s. Great film!"
1 February 2008,Cera_co,1,4,10,Movie Of My Life... seriously,"Did anyone ever made a perfect movie? Probably not. But who did get closest to that? I think Quentin Tarantino. This movie is easily getting in my top 5 best movies ever made. It has everything. Great dialogs (monologs, hehe bible quote), very charismatic characters, interesting story, great soundtrack and it's full of anthology scenes. In fact, I think every scene can be taken as one of the best in film history. This is definitely Tarantino's top film he made. The acting crew is also perfect. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta had roles of their life here. There's no way you won't like them and you just gotta listen to their dialogs. They are just so damn cool. And I have to add... This movie has one of the best opening scenes. Restaurant robbery and misirlou music, oh boy... After watching this movie I was very impressed. Actually I can't find words to describe it. Till this day I don't know how many times I watched it and I'm sure I will watch it again and again and again and... Well, you got the point! haha... Maybe the best words to describe Pulp Fiction are... Quote: ""If I get chance to choose the last movie I will see in my life that would be PF""... Need to say anything else?"
17 October 2015,garym-98883,1,1,10,"Tales of Violence, Redemption and a Glowing Mystery","This is the kind of movie where the viewer becomes completely transfixed in what's happening on screen. Like the addictive Sopranos, we're also drawn into the lives of underworld hit men, drug dealers and zany characters.If you enjoy watching the Sopranos, you'll get a kick out of Pulp Fiction hoping to see Tony Soprano, as the plot unfolds. The storytelling skills of Quentin Tarantino shine throughout this film. It's rich in characters and metaphors throughout.By the end, if you've paid attention throughout, will you finally understand what the glowing object is or will it remain, forever, a mystery?"
10 March 2007,SpiderbiteStudios,0,2,10,It doesn't get any better.,"Movies like this come along only once in a while. This one came along and changed the face of cinema for this generation. With 'Grindhouse' on the horizon soon, Quentin will surely make another mark on the world of movies that will be pondered over for years.I love Tarantino and Rodriquez not just because they make bloody and violent movies. But because they make GOOD bloody and violent movies. They are moviegoers that like to make things that they would like to see themselves. I can just barely remember what movies were like before Pulp and Reservoir Dogs ... and it wasn't nearly as exciting as it is now.Pulp Fiction has been copied and retried so many times that it is almost comical to think back to a time when no one had seen it ... but once he wove this movie into the minds of every movie buff, the only way he could have gone was UP or DOWN ... luckily he went UP. So many directors crash and burn after their first really killer flick, but Quentin keeps 'em coming faster and harder than before, and it just doesn't get any better than when he makes it."
21 February 2017,niallmaggs,0,1,10,Masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantinos second feature film. And most definitely his best. Pulp fiction tells the non linear story of an unsuccessful boxer, a mob boss, 2 mob hit men, coffee shop robbers and a demanding wife as there lives interconnect in some way. The thing that makes pulp fiction stand out above the rest is the incredible and memorable quotes and dialogue protruding from the biggest variation of characters to ever be put on screen. It's one of the most rewatchable films and I have found myself revisiting pulp fiction regularly. If features incredible performances from Sam Jackson, john travolta, uma Thurman, ving Rhames, Eric stoltz, Maria de medeiros, Amanda Plummer, Harvey keitel, Bruce Willis and Christopher walkem.The relentless language and cursing makes for fun times and badass moments. Tarantino and Avery won Oscars for best original screenplay and for good reason, the dialogue is truly incredible and memorable. I highly suggest you watch this masterpiece if you haven't already."
13 December 2016,aubrimmer,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction,"How I have not watched this film before, I don't know. This was truly incredible. The director was able to weave the stories of different people together with such success. A little history lesson tells us that people are starting to like complicated plots and story lines in the 80's(I may be wrong but close to there at least). But ""Pulp Fiction"" takes it to an all new level. This film was a masterpiece in my opinion and reminds me of the ""Crash"" (2004), Paul Haggis.{""Crash"" lives in California seem to CRASH together and follow multiple angles that don't seem to connect but do. Defiantly watch, great film. I've seen it 4 times but am still noticing things that I didn't see before} But anyway, this movie had a great cast that I absolutely love and they gave incredible performances. This film was gritty and violent and even with a complicated story line it all worked together nice. I would not recommend this to everyone but to those who love Quentin Tarantino movies will love this. My favorite of his films is ""Kill Bill""(volumes one and two) but ""Pulp Fiction"" is now up there. His cinematography is always great and even though his movies are gore filled, they do have a humor that seeps out and can make me smile if not laugh. This movie had a great soundtrack, screen writing, and wonderful performances from Uma Thurman, Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis(not to say that the rest of the cast wasn't good but they definitely stood out plus are personal favorites). Definitely a must watch."

One reason for the success of this film is the amazing cinematography. Every camera movement and reflection in this film was precisely thought out. The cinematographer used many details suck as light reflecting in characters eyes to create a dramatic feel and over the shoulder shots with the distance blurred, which created suspense and interest. The camera also took lots of long shots, and still shots but the way they were taken, often up close and focused on a particular object made the movie different than others.

I think the funniest has to be when John Travolta says ""What's up buddy"" to Bruce Willis, and Willis says ""Your not my buddy"". There's such a dark humored tone to that scene. The famous ""royale with cheese"" and ""dog got personality"" are also funny. But there are other scenes, like Willis and his girlfriend in the hotel room, where I'm screaming mercy. They are dreadfully boring scenes. And I'm still not sure what the movie was about. So all in all, Pulp Fiction is a better than average movie. But it's not a ""great"" movie like some people rave. ""Jackie Brown"", Quientin Trantino's other hit, is just as good. And if your looking for a dark humored comedy, check out ""Fargo"" which is much better"

It really is and what helps this incredible story is Tarantino's non linear storytelling which has been copied several times from this revolutionary movie It simply revolutionized cinema from storytelling to the way of acting, directing, cinematography, etc.. And of course it benefits from Tarantino's Fantastic screenplay and coming off the huge success of the Oscar winning classic reservior dogs, people expected very much from this and it exceeded expectations in a way that people didn't think that was possible And of course 1994 can be called as cinema's best year and this is one of the greatest of all time Tarantino's fast and captivating dialogue made this 2 and half hours feel as if it was 2 and a half minutes The sky is the limit and Tarantino touched the sky and made it as good as it could get with this brilliant work The acting was top notch from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jakson and Uma Thurman in Oscar worthy performances and all were nominated but lost ultimatelyIncredibly well shot cinematography and outstanding directing from Tarantino made the classic that people still talk about 22 years onAnd the most brilliant part is Tarantino's screenplay which won the movie's only Oscar and that surprised me because it deserved so much more Samuel L. Jakson was robbed of an Oscar for best supporting actor and i still don't know how he didn't win it No words can describe what i just witnessed here and really this is a must watch and if you haven't watched it already then you miss so much and it really is one of the greatest everFor me i haven't seen something as brilliant as this since The Shawshank Redemption and The godfather so it is third on my own list"
15 January 2007,bladerunna1,1,3,10,Rejuvenation of many careers,"This is the one film that re-writes the book of film-making. Unfortunately Quentin could never and can never repeat such a masterpiece. There are elements of brilliance in his other films but none of them reach the brilliance of each everyday dialogue between the characters that makes it so riveting. So many actors were re-discovered with this movie. John Travolta found that be could be a serious actor outside a music score, Samuel L Jackson found the big break he was destined for, Tim Roth following on from Reservoir Dogs had to be taken seriously across the pond, Bruce Willis must have thanked his stars for featuring in this film without his A-list fee. Ving Rhames Mr big re-rejuvenated his career and this was the sling-shot that catapulted Uma Thurman to fame. nu ff saidEric Stolz played his part to perfection and Harvey Keital was on song."

The characters are developed, but not overly so. The dialogue is great to watch and the action is typical of this kind of move. The story is a good one, complex enough to keep interest but not too complicated like other films can be. From beginning to end, he has you interested.

As the Viet Nam War ended in April of 1975, and assuming that Butch is between six and ten years old, this means that Koons and Coolidge were in the prison camp together starting no later than 1970. The Clutch Cargo show on the television was produced in 1959 with a total of 52 episodes and it appeared in reruns for through the late sixties. U.S. combat forces were not deployed in Viet Nam until 1965. Assuming that Koon's visit was shortly after his release, which would have been in 1975, this would mean that the adult Butch is between 26 and 30 years old, which is young for a prize fighter whose abilities are in natural decline. At the time of filming, Bruce Willis was 39 years old."
20 January 2016,leondavid-83031,1,1,9,Brilliant,"Simply brilliant. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence , the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer direction less excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.)"

It is, as always with Tarantino, a bit odd, dark and complicated, but with just a tad of humor making it really cool and heavy, and adding that extra dimension to the movie!

The story belongs to a typical English movie which has the beginning repeated in last part of it regaining all of its connections to set it right and provides the understandability to its viewers. But the negative part of it is that Mr.Director could have utilized the excellent work of eminent actors like John Travolta and Samuel Jackson to convey some true message which the society is in need of.Unlike any other movies like Shaw shank Redemption or Black Swan, people who expects something strong message, will surely be disappointed. But Of course a set of viewers who shall expect only comedy shall get their target set reached."

                        ","If you like Quentin Tarantino, Sam L Jackson, John Travolta or Bruce Willis watch the film!","I first saw this film when i was fourteen and i am now fifteen and it still has the same impact as it did one year ago. The acting is spot on, the humor is hilarious, the dialoge is fantastic and music is great. The best scene in the whole film is when Jules and Vincent arrive in a apartment asking three men questions Jules tuens to one man and says ""Say what again i dare ya, i double dare ya mother******, say what one more god damn time!"" The way QT works is amazing. The ending is still breathtaking. Defiantly QTs finest hour. i could right about this film all day, but i wont. Lets hope Kill Bill is as great as this. 10/10 *****"
13 August 2005,mrhgibs,1,3,10,Best of '90s.,"Pulp Fiction is a 3 story movie about crime, betrayal, and karma. Directed by the famous and clever Quentin Tarrantino, the film contains memorable phrases and a well developed script, also written by Tarrantino. The movie has brilliant ideas, and is filled with symbolism. While most of the symbolism is subtle, there are a couple instances where it is discussed, even by the actors in the actual movie. The motion picture contains an all star cast, with a wide variety of acting styles. This is a film for any person, no matter what their movie preference is. What completes the movie, is the fact that any movie watcher will consider the film for days, years, it even could stick with them for the rest of their lives."
28 April 2022,etienne_remillard,3,10,1,"Truly ugly, mean and purposeless","I could only watch this for so long and had to stop.The purposeless, ugly violence for its own sake was making me sick to my stomach.Watching John Travolata and Samuel Jackson savagely torture and kill their victims , never stating why was truly pointless and unnecessary that said alot about the audiences taste , intelligence and morality of the writers and director.I suppose the viewers who gave this ugly trash must share the same sick frame of mind to have lauded this performance.I strongly suggest that if you have a taste for action, Fith Element would be a more tasteful alternative."
9 May 2016,betwixtvoid,1,1,10,My coming of age movie.,"I love this film so much. Way back then i'd only see Pulp Fiction memes and mimic figuratively portrayed. Poor being from a third world country, it's truly hard to participate festive on the industry of all kind, specifically film. So when i first saw this film, i really had no idea this is 'it'. This is perfect metaphor of Pandora box for mine. Got me so woke as hell.The aesthetic grain of Pulp Fiction fixated why i should differentiate what is really my liking and what is shoved into my throat. And watching it in 2016 where it's the era of minorities be winning, old racist joke is still kicking right. While i don't mind some spoilers here and there, this is the first time as long as i can remember, i'm watching without no expectation."
26 July 2006,NoRoadsLeft,0,2,10,Amazing... I can't believe how excellent this is,"Pulp Fiction has to be one of the oddest movies I have ever seen. I can not believe how all of this came together, and who could of thought up something so brilliant. I love the music, directing, and, well, basically everything this movie was to offer. But beware, it has extreme language, about 271 F words or something. The only thing about this movie that i am not sure about was the plot. I mean that i don't know what the plot is, and i still kind of don't, but that is what makes this such an interesting movie. With an all-star cast of hit stars such as John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and some other great luminaries of the acting career, Pulp Fiction has to be on the top of everyones list."
19 May 2016,kathleen-93979,1,1,10,Damn Fantastic - Brought Travolta Back,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Everything. Harvey Keitel was fantastic as the cleaner. Brain guts all over the car! Oh my - that was just the bomb! How stupid but how funny! Loved the basement scene with Bruce Willis - bad-ass stuff - and that stuff does happen! Samuel L. Jackson was smooth, suave, quiet and cool....as I would imagine he is in real life. Sorry John - what did you do to your face? But you rocked the movie! Killed it, rocked it! And, the dance baby, oh, that dance - just yummy! Watch me do the Pulp Fiction Twist on Katydid Enigma on YouTube Baby....I can do it all Quentin....eat your heart out.....But it's all good,every movie Quentin makes is a masterpiece."
21 February 2006,ZachGroom,0,2,10,This was divine intervention,"This is to put quite simply the best or at least top 3 of the past ten years of film. I can not stress enough the brilliance of this movie. Like a gift from god.Everything was perfect. From the casting to the plot, the acting, the music. But, by far the dialouge was what made the movie so magnificent. I mean come on, Uncomfrotible Silences. It's just so memorable. Or the hit men, who talk about meaningless topics, and switch in a second to killers.Another great feature of the film is that it challenges you to think about the things that don't often enter your mind, but are puzzling to contemplate. It's all so good.All in all, this script was truly divine intervention."
24 May 2016,vrimkevicius,1,1,10,Simply brilliant,"An entire rainbow of characters intertwined in a bubbly imaginative world of neo-noir. The film is great, it's edgy and daring. Composes of seven narrative sequences and three main story lines, titled as the best written film of all time by some renowned critics and it's hard to disagree.. Pulp fiction is set in the world of humour, violence and inflated realism. It's is reaking of popular culture references at most times in the context of the sub-culture and underground. Being highly stylized, direction both visual and emotional, makes this film truly memorable and unique. No wonder it was nominated for seven Oscars and was also awarded at 1994 Cannes.. Pulp fiction is composed of all the classic best. Great and lively performances by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis to name but a few; Great choice of music tracks by Maria McKee, Neil Diamond, Baker Knight, Al Green, Al Jackson an Jr., Willie Mitchell. Simply impossible not to like.."
15 March 2006,another-dreamer,0,2,10,Retrospective Classic,"If only we could be so wise to the pulp mastery of Tarantino and cast in 1994. This is almost a ""perfect"" movie with respect to pacing, ethos, and storytelling. Nothing has come close to match the wit of dialogue, or the cadence of merging timelines as this classic film. Think deeply about the stories, and ask yourself if you've ever seen this sort of thing cast in film? From the obscure dialogue replete with pop references, to the homage/clichéd scenes of underdog/redemption - no modern film can compete.The cast here was inspired - there wasn't a moment when the heavies could even breathe a sigh of reality under the thick direction of Quentin. Tim Roth was brilliant. Uma Thurman has never been more sauve and sexy. Travolta reinvented heroin chick. And what about Samuel L. Jackson? Expletives deleted would erode his strong prophetic/satanic performance as the collector of lost souls.Character rich... blatantly entertaining and abstruse... the first scenes of homosexual rape ever depicted... how does this not rank as IMDb's first rate film?"
24 May 2016,yasyrevd,1,1,10,Best movie ever,"I'm not into writing reviews, but IMDb asked me to do it. And considering the fact that tomorrow I have an exam and I don't want to start preparing for it, I would better write this shitty words instead of studying. So, I've watched this movie for the goddamn unknown time and it's still entertaining as a freaking Disneyland for adults. And, by the way, I must admit that minimum size of 10 lines is a really brutal torture for me, as I'm suffering from a lack of imagination as hell. And the film is still amazing, yeah, don't forget that this text is supposed to be about Pulp Fiction. In conclusion, I'd like to shout out to my mom, my sister, my cat Partisan and my beautiful girlfriend. Their support really helped me to write this review and to overcome this terrible challenge. This looks like the end. I hope nobody will really read this."
27 March 2006,shan81,3,9,5,Quentin Tarantino and racial slurs,"The movie is interesting at the very least. But quite frankly Quentin Tarantino's films go way over the line with the racial slurs. I can't stand it. I respect that film is art and that the racial slurs are used to build characters and set up scenarios. This is done in many movies and even though I hate and will never use those words my self, I understand there purpose when they are used in most films. In this movie, for the most part, It seemed pointless and unnecessary to the characters and the scenes. It ruined the movie and made Tarantino look like a bigot. This is not the only film I've seen him do this in. Maybe I'm over sensitive to this matter, but I just feel like that there still is far to big of a ""color line"" in this country to be throwing around words that represent so much hate and pain. Pulp Fiction would have received a higher rating from me if it had held back the blaten, unfounded constant use of the n-word."
10 August 1998,Judson-2,0,0,10,IT ROCKS!,"I absolutely love this movie!  The first time I saw it, I thought it was excellent, but I didn't really get a good taste of it until watching it two more times.  It's the type of movie you just have to see more than once, because of all the plot twists and turns.  Tarantino's dialogue is great, and the acting is downright amazing.  SAMUEL JACKSON IS UNBELIEVABLE.  I really like this movie."
21 September 1998,BIGMuzzy,0,0,10,Great! Just great!,"I didn't see anything so blood and cruel to laugh.Well, there are four stories in this film related by common characters. But what are these stories and these characters! They are unbeleivable and realistic in the same time! The film is not like ordinary action or ordinary comedy, there is something new that Tarantino brought to cinematograph.If you don't afraid of blood, brutality, drugs, homosexualists, hitters, ""frehcn"" words etc. (and if you are old enough to watch such films) - watch Pulp Fiction. You'll find how all of these can be fun. Then watch this picture again - and maybe you'll find something you missed."
6 April 2006,dibyajyotisarma,0,2,9,twists without tales,"On the surface, the film is a recipe you've never tasted before. Yet, Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' makes for stupendous movie diet. There is no such narrative in 'Pulp Fiction', only situations. The film is a collage of situations. It is the twists in the tales that Tarantino is concerned about, not the tales. And twists, there are too many. As if, Tarantino's playing music, and once the tune hits the crescendo, he shifts to another. The beauty of the film lies in the detailing of the scenes Tarantino creates, how he fuses breakneck action with slow, lazy scene sequence, how he combines different emotions within a single sequence, how he makes weird characters utterly believable, and how he makes them talk. Shocking and sensational, yes, but Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' is a riveting experience."
15 May 2001,jimmy-21,0,1,10,Perfection,"This film is perfect from the begining to the end, in my humble opioion this is one of thoes films which only come along every so often and totally amaze people(others being Usual suspects,Shawshank and The Godfather). I think the greatness of this film lies in the way it makes you think, the way it intertwines a few stories into one and also by the amazing cast! I don't want to bore you by going on for too long about this film(even though I could go on for some time) i'll simply advise you to watch this film, because once you have you'll never look back!!!10/10"

14 June 2022,GoingDank,1,2,10,Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece,"Out of all the movies Quentin Tarantino has made, Pulp Fiction takes the crown as his best. It's rewatchable, masterfully executed, and funny as hell."
13 May 2020,AugustK1ng,0,0,10,Your parents have definitely seen this.,"One of my personal favorite movies of all time, but that might be because I enjoy the ruthless swearing and violence. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted and there's not a moment that you feel the movie is holding back from the audience, not even 30yrs old and considered a classic because its a staple in cinematic development. From its irony to its witty entertainment, it may not be for everyone but its definitely a fantastic film and hey you'll finally understand your parents references if you give it a watch."
28 June 2022,husseinshaaban,1,1,10,ahead of time,"When pulp fiction came out it was w new form of order a new way of editing and visualizing the sequence of the story telling style
plenty of people from the cinema industry were against the film at once now they know how was Tarantino ahead of time.Similar feedback was against Victoria the German movie by Sebastian shipper
hoping that the industry will be more open to change of view."
29 June 2001,ReservoirDg2k,0,1,10,My favorite movie of all time!!!,This is hands down the best movie i have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino did such a good job. I don't see how Sam Jackson didn't win the best supporting actor award. The only thing this movie needs is Robert De Niro and they got it all. This is such a good movie.
13 September 2008,nirmal_vijay,0,1,9,"Do not analyze, enjoy","Tarantino's movies are the real pop-culture movies. Do not even try to interpret his movies to real life. Just watch the movie and forget about it, only to remember later that, how great the story telling and direction was.Pulp Fiction as the title goes is to be enjoyed, not to be analyzed, segregated or idealized. When you start thinking, What if these characters were real? Stop watching this movie, it will not be fun after that thought.The mix of elements that make up this movie is well balanced, thus originating a special genre of movies that need not be realistic or truthful to be enjoyed.When you listen to conversations like “Royale with cheese” the mind settles for a down-to-earth movie experience, but the characters in this movie are the pop-version of those in Shakespearian plays. Not real but true to the act.Just enjoy the Pulp Fiction, the movie experience alone."

15 June 2015,lamr,0,1,8,a classic already,"Its a new debut for an old/ new successful waveQuentin Tarantino, like Orson Welles (but possibly in a more extravagant, eccentric form and more in accordance with modern forms) is a manipulator and an adventurer. An original cinema creator through out his career. After a century of cinema would that developed in a linear form he came to play a new game that is going to be worth remembering and goes with the adventurous and diverse nature of early ""Illusions""One great thing about Pulp Fiction"" is, that it brought us back to a genre that was out of fashion in a stage of cinema development that totally abandoned the aesthetics of the gross and scandalous. In fact, it also broke the traditional film framework, moving back to a number of pioneering discoveries in the field of cinematic expression dating back to the late 50's early 60-ies."

                        ","trash, pure and not so simple!","Pulp Fiction is just another of Quentin Tarantino's trash attempts to entertain.  Because he is a rising director, I believe that many of the critics don't want to miss the mark, so they complemented this film far above what it was, Pulp Trash.  Many have said it was John Travolta's greatest film, they missed the mark there also.  Tarantino had a web site about the same time the movie was released to explain to the viewers the nuances of his film.  It was really about saving many people's souls, that is what was in the black briefcase.  I see films like this and all I can think is that the writer got wasted and wrote down his great ideas while he was wasted.  The only thing that this film can do is to serve as an example of how not to entertain."
23 August 2019,sidd275,0,1,10,Tarantino at his Iconic best!,"Not the movie you will digest in its first viewing. You blink, and you will surely miss it. Extremely high on memorable moments and repeat value, this movie follows a circular narrative by Tarantino, who seamlessly blends three narratives and viewpoints in one, roughly changing gears of timeline midway your ride high on adrenaline rush. The characters are walking in long tracking shots, talking crazy, dancing like mads to randomly end up in blood. One has to buy it all, for the conviction with which it all is depicted by Tarantino.Attaining the iconic status are also the objects here : the 'Bad MF' Wallet, the $5 Milkshake, Big Kahuna Burgers, Royale with Cheese, the Watch, the shining mysterious Briefcase - you too remember them all. The soundtrack is hard to get out of my mind, the dance sequence of Vincent and Mia is always fun, the Tarantino's cameo is his best one. Those charming eyes of Uma Thurman, the dialogues and wrongly told Ezkiel quote, the act by the primes John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis which still is their best one. These all strands make this movie a celebrated masterpiece, and it will continue to be. But what was in the briefcase? Forget it. What was the story? Don't even try deciphering it."
29 August 2004,Nuktubian,1,2,10,A true Classic !!!,"Watching Pulp Fiction for the first time I didn't know what to expect. After a couple of viewings though, I realized just how amazing this movie is. The dialogue between Jules and Vincent is some of the best in the history of film. Samuel Jackson was robbed at Oscar time(Martin Landau won it) for sure. Come to think of it so was John Travolta, by Forrest Gump of all people. The out of sync story telling was done in a very clever way. I know it owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick's "" The Killing"". But Quentin Tarantino still finds a way to make it his own. I could have done without the Gimp and Zed scene. Couldn't Quentin find a better way to have Marcellus Wallace take the hit off of Butch? I mean come on, they happen upon a place where they are going to sodomized, by a cop no less? Didn't seem to fit there at all. The Wolf scene was a bit weak as well. Other than that the actors all turned in stellar performances. I quote this movie more than any other. Helps when you have seen it a few dozen times. Often ripped off(or tried to be ripped off), since its 1994 release. But never even came close to being duplicated. 10/10 for a true film classic that will be loved for years."
3 May 2006,iamingozi,0,1,10,Just a point or two about the greatest trend setter ever,"Well, instead of going on and on about Pulp Fiction, I want to add just 3 small points that I found more intriguing and absent from any discussions I've seen as of yet. Oddly, they all have to do with the Mr. Wolfe episode... 1. Something that had caught my attention from the first time I saw the movie is that Mr. Wolfe is called early in the morning at a house (or hotel room) that seems to be in the midst of a black tie party! An all-niter I would presume. Not to mention that he takes the call not on a cell phone as most of the other characters do, but on a corded phone in the bedroom! Kinda odd. 2. I had submitted this as trivia, and I hope I am right. But when Jimmie is talking to Mr. Wolfe in his bedroom, Wolfe says to call him ""Winston"". But when Vince and Jules thank him outside of Monster Joe's, he tells them to ""call me Bruce"". If I am wrong in this, I've got issues I need to work out because that's what I've heard every time I see it. Anyway... 3. I don't know if it was meant as a joke of sorts, but when we are introduced to Monster Joe's ""daughter"" (?) Raquel, it seems like they had just turned around as we see some huge lurch of a guy walk in the opposite direction carrying either a crowbar or some other tool/murder weapon. I mean, that guy is huge and I've always assumed that was Monster Joe, seeing he was the size of a monster. I know that someone completely different was supposed to be Joe, but those scenes were deleted so I almost suspect that it was put in as a sort of implication, or another Quentin ""easter egg"". Check it out, you'll see what I mean.Please reply to this if anything I said was wrong....This is just one of those movies where you see something new every time it is shown."
21 March 2002,kaifoongkok,1,2,10,One of the greatest film ever,"Although this film has received very high critical acclaims worldwide, but it's still not as well-known as it deserved. Maybe it's too much of a film Noir follower, but even after i finished a short Noir course, I can't commit myself to agree that Noir is that big a deal. Pulp Fiction is so perfectly done on almost(I haven't found one yet today!) all perspectives in a film production. How can it not as well known as Stars War?...I must be silly. ""If you haven't watched 'A Clockwork Orange' yet, you are shame to say you'd watch a movie before...""--this was an advertisement title i seen to introduce this amazing movie, and today, I'll say: ""If you haven't watched 'Pulp Fiction' yet, you are shame to say you'd watched movies in the 90s""."
31 December 2006,talbmail,1,3,10,Simply Pulp Fiction,"What makes a movie unforgettable? A movie that will burn in your mind forever, and you'd always want to see it, again and again? I don't know, but most certainly Pulp Fiction has that secret formula. The wide range of (good!) actors is fascinating, and the gangster plot is more than thrilling at times.It's even hard to say what is this movie about... What's the purpose? Can't say. It looks, like its name, Pulp Fiction, but, when you look deeper into it, you find the plot to be unforgettable, along with classic moments such as ""How do they call half a pound of cheeseburger in Europe"".I think that's a proof to what a talented director and script writer can do with a couple of well done and furbished dialogs, a thrilling plot and an original, time-leaping plot timing.In short - No, it's not one of those 'So bad that it's good"" movies, it's simply a good one. Watch it, and I promise you you'll never forget it."

9 August 2002,grutto,1,2,9,Impressive,"Just recently, I watched this movie for the second time, the first occasion being in the theater.I find this movie one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen, if not the most impressive one.I love the neat dialogues between Vincent and Jules. What particularly amuses me about this is that it's unlikely that such harsh criminals would have the kind of conversations they have.There is also something that bothers me about movies like Pulp Fiction. Although not intended to do so, they glorify the underworld. I mean...is this Jules cool or what? Also I think humour and violence form a disturbing cocktail.O yeah... The real reason the French call their Quarter Pounder a ""Royale"" is that they are self-willed. They are so damn proud of their language that they use as less foreign language as possible. Almost all European countries use the metric system, but only in France a Quarter Pounder is called a ""Royale""."
23 December 2008,Marle_dreng,1,2,10,More than a movie,"Pulp Fiction is considered one of the true Tarantino classics, if not THE classic. It is a gangster movie that presents several incidents over a specific period of time, not necessarily chronologically, all in connection with each other in some way.PF is a different kind of film; it contains many genres such as action, drama, comedy, crime etc. and it also contains many different themes. It is hard to put this film in a specific category and consider this film to be a specific type of film; it is what it is - something unique, something original. Pulp Fiction is the perfect name for this creature of a film, because it is nothing and it is everything. It has no message or true story that it is about. This film is what ever you want it to be! This film has given me the precise description of what being cool is! The character Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the absolute coolest character of all time, if you ask me (I dare to claim that others will agree with me deeply). If you have not yet seen this magnificent piece of art, this you must do as soon as you get of work/school/whatever you're busy with right now. This film is filled with great speech lines, perfect violence scenes, the definition of coolness, perfectly selected background music, perfect actors and I could go on, I swear.Although this film does not tend to tell or show anything, it gives you a lot of good sequences and pleasures both your eyes and ears while doing so. Although I love this film as my all time favorite, I understand why some people don't understand the greatness of this film. Many people can't cope with the fact that it does not seem like your typical gangster/action film and therefore they find it peculiar, maybe even absurd.I sure hope that you will enjoy this film for what it is (as I did, do and will keep on doing); a perfect film experience in its own genre that contains everything you need on screen in a 154 min interval. Everything in its own unique and extremely simple way. This is more than a movie. Hope you'll enjoy! 10/10"

                        ",Very good,"Before I start, I'd like to get one thing off my mind.  I don't understand why the violence in this movie was so hyped up.  I think there were about 4 violent scenes in the movie (the opening scene, the accidental shooting, the S&M rednecks, and the confrontation between Bruce Willis and John Travolta). Although the scene with the S&M guys was pretty disgusting, it only lasts about 3 seconds, any R rated action movie that's come out in the last 10 years has more violence than Pulp Fiction did.  I really look at Pulp Fiction as a comedy, a satirical view of society.  The dialogue is consistently hilarious, and there are many darkly humorous moments in the film.  I thought that the scenes with Travolta and Jackson were the movie's strongest points, but the whole thing was good.  I still liked Reservoir Dogs better, though."
16 September 2006,rjm811,1,4,10,A film that combines all genres while creating it's own,"OK, I thought I'd write my review after seeing it for probably the 25th time, while straight, stoned and in between.First, I'm almost a Tarantino character in real life.Great for movies; sucks in real life.Spent 15 years in prison for property crimes from a life of drug use/abuse. I'm also an accomplished blues/jazz/funk/rock guitarist HTTP://www.myspace.com/randallcasters (mostly rock, check out pulp fiction inspired surf; ""conversation stopper""), and am also a maker of guitars and used to be a clandestine chemist who ""dreamed"" up ""ecstacy"" among other phenethylamine-type drugs. That's been over with for awhile now.That out of the way, let me begin first, by how much Q.T's personal story of working in video shops and how he wrote and acted to get to the point of PF moved me.I first saw the movie after getting out of the Joint in '98, after I'd heard about it, and it had been out on VHS for quite awhile.I was sick as a dog from some virus and watched while laying on the floor in a fever induced delirium.I didn't get it right then, or was able to appreciate the subtle and not so subtle greatness of the film.That began a series of viewings over the years during which all the facets of this masterpiece, in writing, direction, acting, showed themselves, and made me appreciate the genius of QT.From the start, it engrosses. Tim Roth's and Amanda Plummer's acting along with the dialog, just borders on the surreal. It's the concept of talking in a crowd while knowing your conversation is yadda yadda just like everyone else's, no matter your subject. All anyone has to do, is check the facial cues of those around you, to detect if anyone is actually listening.Look at Roth's use of his hands as he speaks. How he accents lines by the ways he blows out smoke from his cig. Genius. The way Honeybunny effusively says thank you when the waitress brings more coffee. These little points are the essence of PF.The film is full of them.So much has been said about the dialog between Jules and Vince in the car, that I can't add anything, but that it is genius...period.The scene in the apt., also, a perfect combination of well written dialog combined with perfect acting. The rub is that the imperfections, when they occur,actually ADD to the totality of the film.it's like QT had the film god with him throughout.Mistakes galore. My favorite scene is Chris waken's with the young Butch.The way Walken permutes to soldier/racist in his delivery after""this watch...."", and his inflections are just hilarious!""and..one place he knew he could hide it..""HIS ASS"" ""I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal..(up my ass), TWO YEARS>> No other film will approach this one in mt lifetime!!!!!!get WI me for talk Y'all!."
22 September 2002,riksmits,1,2,10,A true piece of art,"When a first saw pulp fiction I was overwhelmed that Hollywood could make such movies. A film that includes a cast like pulp fiction starring so many top actors, you couldn't expect nothing but a masterpiece. Well you couldn't be more right. Pulp Fiction includes every ingredient a good film should have, humor, action, a good script, good actors and good acting. In my top ten list it's number five. I really recomment this to people who like movies from this genre."

                        ",Untouchable,"With the seemingly endless stream of overrated non-events that have been coming down the pike this decade. (""L.A Confidential"", anyone??), this one is a real rarity: A film that genuinely lives up to its hype."
27 May 2017,Henneghien,2,3,9,Exceptional !,"Exceptional. Pulp Fiction can not be classified in any category, it goes beyond anything that has been done before and creates something that no one else can reproduce except Tarantino himself. The scenario is very particular, disconnected and mended with relevance in order to present the film to us in a new light. We are transported in the past, the future and we return to the present."
2 December 2008,samlikeschicken36,1,2,8,Brilliant Dialogue Drives Quirky Plot,"As an avid movie watcher, I had heard the many rave reviews of this particular film, Pulp Fiction. Also, seeing its astonishingly high ranking on the IMDb Top 250 prompted me to watch it as well. I am glad to say that it was not the mainstream violence fiesta I expected it to be, but an original, clever, and plot-twisting drama.The plot contains a few different stories, one of a boxer, hit-men, and some others, that intertwine throughout the film. Tarantino's style of visual narration is one of boldness, as he uses a frequently often mixed up timeline that really leaves the viewer guessing what's going to be revealed next. His directorial excellence in this element really made me appreciate the film and screenplay that much more. At times, some points in the story seemingly became meaningless, and may have possibly ended up being that way, but it was the brilliantly entertaining dialogue that effortlessly filled these gaps in my attention span and didn't let the odd tales cause a dismay in my opinion on the film. All of Tarantino's scripts ooze humor, intelligence and emotional suspense, and this film I believe to be his most orally inventive. No conversation goes without a laugh or a provoked thought. The dialogue in this movie was just plain amazingly real, as these could have likely been real conversations. It is for this reason, I hold Pulp Fiction in such high regard as a movie, and as a game changer in the industry as far as screenplays go.The acting, I'm sure to nobody's denial, was excellent. All the characters, Samuel L. Jackson's being my personal favorite, executed their lines with the power and connotations that their writer intended. Many fans of the actors in this film will see their favorite stars portray unlikely roles, as all of the interestingly weird people in the movie are abnormal, and great, if I might add. Without argument, the acting in Pulp Fiction propelled its story and settings to a whole new level in cinema. Though the awesomely smart, action-packed, and witty Pulp Fiction had some slow areas in its story and development, its excellent dialogue and quirky characters pushed it to cinematic glory. A wonderfully non-ubiquitous movie, I give Pulp Fiction 8/10."
4 August 1999,reelbuff,0,0,10,I dig it the most....,"The movie experience of the decade for me comes via PULP FICTION. When it opened on opening day to little fanfare or hype, I asked my friends if they'd want to go. None did. So, I went by myself and had the most spiritual film experience of my life thus far (I'm 24). Electric, Sharp, Masterfully crafted, and an incredible screenplay only tap the beginning as to how I feel about this masterpiece. PULP FICTION is Why God Created Film."

                        ",One of the best films ever,"Tarantino is a genius. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the best films ever. It is my second all time favorite (""Reservoir Dogs"" is my first, another Tarantino film). ""Pulp Fiction"" is the story of two hit men, their boss's sexy wife, a last-chance  prizefighter, and two thieves robbing a coffee shop. An outstanding cast which includes Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis,and Harvey Keitel. This movie gives a big dose of action and humor. 10/10. If you haven't seen this you shouldn't be reading this comment, you should be at the video store renting it!!"

                        ",pulp monster,"QT created a film which has been blown out of all proportion. I feel sorry for QT, he's become a modern day deity for some. If a person makes such a big thing about a film whose own name says everything about it - pulp fiction i.e. blo*dy meaningless cheap thrill c**p - then if I was QT I would be very afraid for what I'd done. Pulp fiction is an entertaining film, it's like a blend of cheesy American thrills and disco lights, all coated in a sweet seventies syrup. Any person thinking it more profound than that just hasn't grown up yet. I hope for QT sake they eventually do. Sadly, many hadn't by the time the far superior Jackie Brown came out, and I'm sure it won't be long before cries of betrayal of heard coming from the mushroom masses once again. Poor old QT."

If you don't believe me then watch it or I will do crimes on you. It's not as good as real violence but it helped me get through a difficult patch in my life when I killed someone (accidentally it was later proved) and for a while I thought I was Pulp Fiction. However, when I watched it again I realized that I am not because I was made before it. This is the best film ever made but it's not as good as the Tarantino contribution to Four Rooms which is the best film ever made."

24 July 2015,mamba-rod,1,2,10,Best Film Ever,"This is perfect storytelling, acting... An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time. Samuel Jackson plays Tarantino's screenplay like a music instrument, John Travolta seems to be back from the dead, Harvey Keitel is hilarious, Uma Thurman's part is so moving, Bruce Willis is so bad ass, Maria Medeiros so cute... Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie. With ""Wild at Heart"" by David Lynch, it's one of the greatest rock'n'roll Palme d'Or in movie history. If you haven't see it yet,how lucky you are !"
26 April 2001,TomAyles,0,1,10,"Fantastic story telling, amazing imagery, and a great cast.","The two best things about this film are the story-telling techniques and the imagery, both proving that Quentin Tarentino is the finest film maker of our time.  The story jumps around in both time and place, switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts.  And the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpin's wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home; the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban, middle class house; Bruce Willis walking down some stairs, carrying a sword, wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves.  You don't so much watch the movie as experience it."

                        ",Pulpilicious,"What a great movie. I have seen it for the first time this week. Nine years after its released I have finally got a chance to watch it. I probably watched it for the first time now because I probably wouldnt understand it when it first came out. Im 17 and i really liked this crime drama. Quentin Tarantino is brillaint! His imagination of a crime world is breathtaking. This film probably plots out the lifes of actual hitmen. Travolta and Jackson,  2 seemingly careless hitmen just doing their duty. Travoltas adventure with Thurman very exciting and breathtaking. For a hitman travoltas character was a pretty nice guy. Took a girl out for dinner, danced with her, and even saved her life from a drug overdose. Sadly, Travolta's character comes to a how do you say with out spoiling this...... a tragic moment. Willis's character, was sharp and smart. He plays a boxer who is on the run from a crime boss (Ving Rhames)for killing a boxer in a match. Willis stupid foreign wife forgets willis precious watch which was up his dad's rectum for 7 years and then given to his friend after he was killed and then gaven to his son. Willis then gets into a pretty disgusting and strange confrentation with a bunch of weirdos at a gun shop. Willis though does get himself out of trouble by helping that certain crime boss.... from a bit of a embarrising life memory. Willis does another great performance in another Great film. Now Jackson probably had the most noblelest role of the whole film. A hit man, partners with travolta's character who is only trying to do his job. Even a person who worships the lord himself. Jackson gets into a couple of frenzy in the films. One when his partner accidentally blows some kids brains out in the back of his car and must have the body taken care of and the car cleaned. And the other, is a robbery happening at a restaurant. TIm Roths character is amazingly changed and shut up'd by jacksons character. Though Jackson stoppeD tim roths character from being mr bad boy robber, to mr scared straight robber. Jackson does though let roth keep the money from all the victims. What a great guy huh????? This is film is indeed Pulpilicous. I give this film a 5 out of a possible 5."

                        ",Sex and Drugs and samurai swords,"Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films in history. It had its own genre, and no other film can compare. John Travolta proved he could dance when he did the Twist with Uma Thurman, who deserved her Best Supporting Actress nominations (especially after the cocaine scene). Samuel L Jackson was brilliantly cast as the philosophical Jules. Quentin Tarantino has created a brilliant film here, and an applause for all who contributed in this film."
20 June 2003,fireinside77,1,2,10,Amazing film,"Throughout movie history there have been a few films that come along and change the way you look at movies and this is one of them.  This movie is one of the best of all time.  This movie has you cheering for criminals.Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Pulp Fiction was amazing.  He made you truly believe that he was a hitman with morals and doubts.  The end scene at the coffe shop was truly stirring.  ""But I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying real hard to be the shepard.""Quentin Tarantino is one of the best writers ever.  His dialect makes this movie extremely enjoyable.  And though a great deal of the movie is talking it never seems slow."
9 April 2011,cmcafeeky,0,2,10,Tarantino's Modern Classic,"Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of its decade. It spawned tons of imitators in both style, character development, and structure. Its nonlinear timeline may or may not be a Tarantino homage to Citizen Kane, and can be seen in such modern classics as Memento and The Usual Suspects to name an elite few. There are no bad scenes in this movie. It starts strong, gets better, and then ends on a high note. While it concerns the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a crime boss's wife, a pair of petty thieves in a nonlinear tale of the intersecting story lines, its style and the characters make it about much more. Amazing opening scene kicks off the fun when Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) casually discuss their robbery strategies, profess their sugar sweet love for each other, and then sudden shift into full throated threats toward the patrons in the quiet dinner. The opening conversation between Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samual L. Jackson) is a classic in hyper stylized cool hipster conversation. There musings on a life in Amsterdam, a ""Royal with Cheese"" , and the appropriateness of as foot massage, and what may happen if someone gets too cozy with the big bosses woman is a definite high point in scatological dialogue from a crime movie. All of the acting here is top notch. Travolta makes an impressive return. He exudes charisma and is pitch perfect in every scene. Michael Madsen was originally offered the role, but due to scheduling difficulties was not able to participate. While Madsen was terrific in Tranatino's first directorial outing Reservoir Dogs, it's now hard to imagine anyone else in the role other than Travolta. The date at Jack Rabbit Slims is about as much fun as can be had in a restaurant. Travolta gets to reprise his dancing, which helped skyrocket him to fame in the 70's, while helping reestablish himself here after his career waned somewhat during the late 80s. Uma Thurman does well as the big crime bosses sexy wife Mia. The black bangs seem to be a nod to other bad girls, or maybe Bettie Page. The OD scene is harrowing. Samual L. Jackson also delights as a contemplative hit man Jules. Does a movie get any more intense then when Jules spouts his Ezekiel speech as he looks down his gun barrel at a man who tried to do Marcellus Wallace wrong?It would be hard to imagine these two veteran actors having a cooler more impressive role then they found here with Tarantino's dialogue. Does it get any better than when Jules has his gun on Honey Bunny and he muses on the meaning of his Ezekiel passage? Bruce Willis does great job as the boxer who is coerced to throw a fight. He is great here as the old Palooka nearing the end and looking for one last big payday. Great interplay with his love interest helps provide some character balance countered by him almost going ballistic when she forgets his most prized possession when they start on the lam. I absolutely love Christopher Walken's cameo speech to a young boy, and all that had transpired in order for him to present him with the family heirloom wrist watch. I loved Bruce Willis and Ving Rhame's collision, fight and the scenes eventually payoff. ""Bring in the Gimp"" is a fantastic set piece. All of the characters here are vivid, stylized originals un-paralleled elsewhere. Dialogue is at the heart of Quenton Tarantino film. It could be compared to Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard. It is fascinating and stylish and speaks volumes of the hip styling's of the characters and movies which were written by Tarantino. A self-professed movie junky, Trantino is able to supple his characters with a way of speaking about the mundane that both informs the viewer, as well as the other characters, that the conversation here is not only fun, but it is speaking volumes. About the only thing that may be more revered than the dialogue here is the movies violence. There is a ton of it in this movie. The movie never seems to use violence as the attraction, but it does revel in the titillation associated with its allure. There are so many lines and scenes here that are now classics. The characters here aren't always talking about what has transpired, or what is going to happen, they leave normal plot devices to immerse themselves, and the view are, in to highly stylized lingo that becomes even more interesting than the violence in which they participate. The violence takes a back seat to the dialogue, but still there is no escape from what implications are doled out by violence here. This is a modern day classic. . It is exhilarating from start to finish. It is one of the crime genres greatest movies, and deserves to be held in high esteem from the industries top critics. It ranks as IMDb's #5 ranked movie of all time. Roger Ebert gives it high praise, two thumbs way up, and 4 out of 4 stars, while including it as one of his re-reviewed entries in his book 'The Great Movies'. This is a pop culture at it apex. American Film Institute list saw Pulp Fiction ranked #95 in 1997, and was #94 ten years later in the revised 2007 list, while ranking as the #7 'Gangster' movie from an AFI list from 1998. Bottom Line: I would give this movie a 96. It would be more enjoyed by those who don't avoid violence in films, and should be avoided by those with conservative tastes."
3 August 2003,Movie_Buff_9,1,2,10,My favorite f*ckin' movie!,The best film of the 90's set the standard of Independent film making. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece will eventually be seen as one of the greatest of all time and one of the most ground-breaking films of modern times.  It was a slap in the face to all the boring movies that the 90's were spitting out.  Lost Academy Award to Forest Gump and it was sickening to my stomach to see such a lame scripted and lame acted (besides Hanks) movie win over such a great screenplay and stellar cast.  Not one actor\actress in Pulp Fiction gave a performance anywhere near as bad as the woman who played Jenny.  I get goose bumps every time Samuel L. Jackson recites Ezekiel 25:17 and John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's dance scene is one for the ages.  One the best acted and written films of all time keeps getting more and more appreciated over time.
15 March 2013,Amadeus_Smith,0,1,10,Instant Classic - The Best Movie of the '90s,"Quentin Tarantino's first masterpiece. The highly and critically acclaimed 1994 movie became a quick cult classic with its unconventional structure, immensely witty dialogue and great examples of excellent casting.While there is no absolute lead actor or main character, John Travolta became the real shining star of the film as he went from an almost forgotten celebrity to a surprise academy award nominee. Opinions of Travolta skyrocketed after his admirable performance in Pulp Fiction, made even more special with Quentin Tarantino by his side, with his script and his vision. Other actors who made Tarantino's casting ability reign significant were Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and a small Christopher Walken role.The brilliant casting went on to create brilliant characters. These characters were brought to life by their portrayals, witty dialogue, memorable moments and top notch chemistry; everybody remembers this movie for fantastic philosophical and psychological pieces of long dialogue that never get boring, mostly involving Travolta and Jackson, or to an even greater degree, Travolta and Thurman. It's hard to keep describing the characters, story and memorable scenes because there is just so much and too much to talk about, it's just much easier to say that everybody involved in the process did a great job.There is something in Pulp Fiction for everyone, for every die-hard movie fan, to every aspiring director or writer, to every casual cinema- goer. There is action, violence significant to the film's shape and style, quintessential Tarantino trademarks, some fine notable qualities on the visual and design side of things and an incredibly memorable soundtrack, the latter of all these qualities perhaps being the most enjoyable generally. I really can't think of a movie that portrays better utilisation of a non-original score than this, with every song used as a device to set the mood, to capture your attention or to fit in nicely with the cinematography in its own sense of aloofness. The soundtrack boasts a fine array of surf rock and funk/soul music.Of course, what will always be remembered, what will almost make Pulp Fiction innovative is the series of basic stories, made not-so-basic with an intriguing, non-chronological structure. The movie ends with a scene that takes place before the first main story that is presented, that being John Travolta's character Vincent Vega taking his boss's wife Mia Wallace (Thurman) out. But don't worry; you won't need a synopsis written out for you as you watch the movie, because in pure Tarantino style, it is complicated but at the same time consumable. And speaking of, the main accolade here is quite simply the remarkable job done by Quentin Tarantino in his second feature length directing effort. Made slightly frustrating by not being able to direct some of his earlier screenplays, the man knew that he was made to be a success in the movie industry, and after the release of Pulp Fiction, everybody knew it.Pulp Fiction taught us so many things, not just what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France, but also not to have such a conservative outlook on movies. With a legacy that will always live on, Pulp Fiction is simply put, my favourite movie. I envy anybody who still hasn't watched it, you are really in for a treat. It is one of the all-time greatest films, and if you disagree then I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger. *****"
25 May 2021,munnath,1,1,9,A genuine Masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Highly recommended."
15 March 2015,Wiizardii321,0,0,9,A movie that redefined the genre into it's own.,"There was Godfather, there was Goodfellas, there was Reservoir Dogs, and there was this little thing called Pulp Fiction.Wow, that is all I can say when it comes to Pulp Fiction. It is one of the most different put movies I have ever watched. Was it the non-linear story? Was it the colorful characters? Was it the brilliant acting? Or was it Jules Winnfield? I'll never know, but I certainly do know that this was the movie that made Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite movie directors of all time. The most interesting thing about Pulp Fiction was it's non- linear storyline, put. The first time I watched it, I was like ''oh damn, this will be pretty difficult.'' Pulp Fiction challenged the viewers in a way. The story is such a central focus and it is so good. Samuel L. Jackson gave in my opinion of the funniest performances of all time as Jules Winnfield. ''I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing!''"
12 November 2005,don-lockwood,0,1,7,"A modern classic, but not my cup of tea","Quentin Tarantino's bloody ode to Asian gangster movies is reverent, satirical, and engrossing - just not for the faint of heart. Interconnecting stories seem to say more about the heedless violence of crime than the doomed characters who are drawn down its path. John Travolta made a comeback with his role in this modern classic, but behold the power of Samuel L. Jackson in an essentially leading role and witness the dawn of sexy Uma Thurman, future star of Kill Bill (perhaps a more easily enjoyable film, given its tongue-in-cheek nature as a pure action flick). The best scene is Travolta's appropriately nostalgic dance with Thurman to ""You Never Can Tell."""

22 June 2004,mikey-potehunt,1,2,10,A Mordern Classic,"This film is amazing! Pulp Fiction is the kind of film which must be seen. You should either rent it or I suggest buy it so you can watch it. The story depicts a harsh L.A underworld practically ruled by a man named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and how he sends two hit men to carry out a hit. The story is told out of sequence which adds to the pure awe of this film. With an all star cast including: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi (a little bit), and even Quentin Tarantino himself, this film is pure enjoyment start to finish.

10 April 2007,lvgoold,0,1,10,Profound!,"I am a major fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. There is no film that he has starred in, written or directed that I have not enjoyed. He has a very unique talent within film.Pulp Fiction is about two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out, when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch is a boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. The lives of these unrelated people are linked together, comprising of a series of funny and bizarre incidents.Pulp Fiction is my favourite film, I have a massive DVD collection, which is still rapidly growing. Amongst all of them Pulp Fiction always has the no. 1 slot. It is a film that you could watch over and over again, but each time you watch it you see something that you missed before. I also have the Pulp Fiction soundtrack and a the replica of wallet that Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) has in the film.Each actor has achieved greater stardom from Pulp Fiction. I don't think anyone would have seen Uma Therman's potential if it wasn't for Tarantino. And because of Tarantino, John Travolta made a magnificent come back.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes a good action, humour and who enjoys Quentin Tarantino's work!!!!"

This is somewhat different, a well organised puzzle of a story, switching to different periods in time, that links and fits perfectly to create an epic movie brimming with stylish dialogue and interesting characters. The events That take place throughout the movie have it all, shocking scenes, tension, action, smart dialogue, well written stories, mesmerising conversation, romance and twists and turns. The whole package is topped off with a fantastic soundtrack full of great songs which compliment the picture perfectly. One of the unique things about tarantinos style is that the dialogue is so simple, about everyday things and occurrences, but you feel yourself so immersed in it, as the characters stylishly discuss things which bear no importance to the story, yet we find them so engrossing. This tactic has been used to build up tension, create an unpredictable atmosphere and create a real sense of sharp conversation. Pulp fiction is his best movie in my eyes, every scene and line of speech being near perfection."

                        ",Pulp Fiction is an incredibly revolutionary film.,"Pulp Fiction is a wonderfully hip and gritty film. Quentin Tarantino's screenplay is astonishingly witty, sharp, remarkable, and intelligent. The script expertly touches on many social, cultural, and religious aspects of the American society. Tarantino's direction is stylish and unique. The cast is among the best ever assembled. John Travolta turns in a wonderful performance as Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson delivers quite possibly his best performance as Jules Winnfield - the philosophical hit man. He speaks his lines with cold determination. Uma Thurman is impeccable as Mia Wallace. The soundtrack fits nicely with the context of the movie. Pulp's pacing slows down towards the middle of the film but it does not hinder the film's overall effect. If you don't mind objectionable language and material, I urge you to give Pulp Fiction a try.  10/10"
15 May 2004,jinmin45,1,2,10,My favorite movie flat out,"Come on, This is Pulp Fiction were talking about. What can I say about this film. it has a kick ass plot, the dialog is hilarious, the acting is superb,etc. There's lots of reasons why this is my favorite. This is in my opinion one of the best movies of the 90's. If anyone of you that haven't seen this movie. GO RENT IT, you'll never experience movies this one. Samuel Jackson gives up his best performance in this independent film. John Travolta makes a ultimate comeback in films and just the whole cast is great. This movie also has a great 2 disc DVD which I own and I love it. Out of all I give this film a thumbs up giving it a 10/10..........10's the maximum number, my real rate would be 20/10"

                        ",Film of the decade,"Stupendously good film, the casting, acting, storylines are all so good. Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta are so good together that is hard, despite their awesome talent, to watch them in anything else and not think of Pulp Fiction.  The dialogue is great, just silly little conversations like we all have in day to day life.  Without a doubt the film of the nineties and up in my top 3 of all time."

Any way, i didn't enjoy even that much too, but the good thing here is the acting, yes.. was great. the point is, i cant understand why the high rate?!, i was talking with a friend, telling me its wow. i was asking him why?.. he couldn't even answer. another good thing here.. the story line is great. the last like,,, i was asking my self: am i rated it as 6/10, because its over rated?.. would i rate it as 7 or even 8, if its not?.. ya i was wondering. any way, as always.. i will be waiting for the next Quentin Tarantino's movie :)"
16 January 2016,JesperIsaksen,1,2,10,Tarantino at his best!,"One of the best films EVER! And by far the BEST Tarantino movie EVER! Love this picture, especially the dialogs, they are truly awesome! This film made me wanna make my own films and become a movie director. I've always like movies that were gritty, bloody and raw combining a good screenplay and awesome performance's by actors and actresses. Tarantino is a master in funny, sarcastic, violent and gritty movies and dialogs. It's harder than people think to transform a screenplay into an awesome film and natural flowing dialogs for, but Tarantino nails it. You definitely need a GREAT cast and you really have to make the perfect setting surrounding the film crew and actors/actresses. You have to work with the actors and allow some improvisations along the way. I'm sure that happened to a certain degree in Pulp Fiction. However, it doesn't take anything away from the awesome screenplay and Tarantino's ability to direct some of the biggest stars in the world. Go see it, NOW!"

                        ","dark humor, masterful storytelling","Directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction, is told in the same discontinuous chronology as his first work Reservoir Dogs. Through four separate and seemingly unrelated stories Tarantino succeeds in telling an epic story of mobsters, a gold watch, and redemption. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are convincing as two mob hit men caught in a very interesting day, and their target Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis is a man of vicious tenacity who desires to know what it means `to kill a man.' While the subject matter is relatively heavy, Tarantino's witticism and dark humor help its delivery."

                        ",Greatest film in the history of the cinema,"Pulp Fiction is, without even the teeniest shadow of a doubt, the greatest film of all time. Why? Because it is something we have never seen before and will never see again. The film itself is a work of art, and I think all those involved knew it. Tarantino uses wide lenses, steady cams, and track shots to capture the films actors, locations, and the raw emotion surrounding them. Pulp isn't told in chronological order, which actually improves the telling of the three stories and how they interconnect. Each of the actors gives a stellar, out-of-this-world, easily the best performances of their careers. What makes Pulp Fiction so great is the dialogue. These people talk about things that anyone would talk about on an ordinary day. A perfect example of this is Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. They begin talking about differences between Europe and the US, then move right on to talk about how they should have guns to take out the people up in an apartment, then talk about TV. Bruce Willis gives easily the best performance of his career as Butch the Boxer. And who could forget Christopher Walken, who will forever be remembered for his speech about Butch's gold watch. Pulp will forever be quoted by people and kids in school yards for its memorable lines, such as: ""Aww man, I shot Marvin in the face"", ""Your dad had this watch up his ass for five years, and he died of dysentery"", ""Royale with cheese"", and ""The spider caught himself a couple of flies."" This film deserves a 100(no typo) out of 10."
31 January 2005,keesch83,1,3,10,More than meets the eye,"Most of the time when I see a movie that has been so completely hyped beyond disbelief the movie turns out to be a disappointment, For Pulp Fiction, this definitely wasn't the case. From the very beginning I was captivated with the dialog and felt that I couldn't turn my head away because I had to see what was going to happen next. John Travolta and Sam Jackson give their best performances ever; watching them together is a real treat. The greatest part of this movie though is seeing how the movie rewinds and shows something going on in a different perspective. Everything in this film is brilliant and shouldn't be missed. One movie that actually lives up to the hype. Even if you've seen it once and didn't like it, watch it once more just to make sure.10/10"
21 October 2012,sarahc1694,1,2,8,Brilliant,"I've always been a fan of the proclaimed 'cult classics', as a teen, i find enjoyment through immersing myself within the ream of older film, which have been nurtured with perpetual praise for their sheer brilliance. This Quintin tarentino film falls nothing short of this belief, it is smart, acutely enjoyable and fun. Despite some gruesome violent scenes and it's ability to drag out long dialog, these minor inefficiencies cannot weigh down the amazing entirety of the film. I found myself empathetic with the persona's (especially Bruce Willis) with their ability to magnify likability. This left me indulged and intrigued within the heavy tension of the intense action scenes, promoting my sustained attention as to what was going to happen next.The characters, plot, sometimes witty dialog (a common trait exerted by taranteno) and action scenes favorably complimented my amazement with this film. A nostalgic experience also elevates my praise for this movie, a great cinematic work of art. Therefore i give it 8 out of 10."

                        ",OVERRATED,"This movie is terrible. Completely terrible. I honestly don't know why it is so ""critically acclaimed"". Granted there are some cool lines from Samuel L. Jackson, and that's the only redeeming value of this movie. The story lines are so boring, I tried hard not to fall asleep during the segment with Bruce Willis. In the hands of another director, this would have been labeled garbage, but since this is Quentin Tarantino(the god of hype) it's praised. I just don't get it. I actually enjoyed Jackie Brown much more. Never once have I been so dissapointed by a critically praised movie in my life. It had everything that I like in a movie-guns, drugs, language, violence, and Samuel L. Jackson but failed...miserably. I hope this review goes on top, because every other person has been brainwashed into thinking this is a cinematic masterpiece. People listen: do not follow the hype and come out and say how terrible this movie actually is. Don't worry the film critics aren't going to attack you or anything, just speak your mind on how bad this movie really is. 1 out of 10 stars."

                        ",pulp fiction is one of the most entertaining films of all time,"1994's pulp fiction is by far my favorite movie of all time. Both John Travolta and Sam L. Jackson, put on an outstanding performance. Pulp Fiction also has the best dialog i have ever heard in a movie. Even though this movie comes out as a series film, the script is surprisingly funny.Another good characteristic of this movie is that it is shown out of order, this makes the movie a lot better because the stories begin to overlap each other, explaining things that arn't explained the first time it is shown. Their are also a lot of good cameos/co-starts in this movie such as Bruce Willice, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walkens, and Steve Buscemi although the movie is very violent and has a lot of profanity, it is a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again."

On top of that, and maybe in support of that, it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie.What more do people want? This is a masterpiece, in a totally different category than anything Tarrantino released before or after.And people who don't like excessive violence, more than 10.000 people are shot to death each year in the states. So really open your eyes, it is not like this comes from nothing. This movie is completely realistic in that aspect."

Tarantino is probably one of the most talented directors out there, with his trademark camera shots and interesting ways to look at stuff. Sure, some people may get sleepy when Uma Thurman and John Travolta's characters talk, but you have to admit it is still good nether the less. Oh yeah, the best part is when John Travolta blows off a person's head The stories all connect and put an interesting twist to the film. All the actors really do a great job and several really memorable lines. As the film ends you will think to yourself, ""what a great experience"". I would like to see a ""Pulp Fiction 2""."
7 March 2005,psycho_fluff,1,3,9,just a great film!,"I think Pulp Fiction is one of the best films out there! I loved Kill Bill 1 and 2, and Reservoir, but wasn't as keen on Jackie Brown. I love this infantile humour Tarantino has in his films, from the accidental killing of Marvin, to the bewildered Vince and Butch. I love how the film is produced. The way the narrative is constructed or in a way re-constructed (in classical terms) is brilliant, and clever. It keeps with the kind of audience Pulp Fiction was made for; this television slob, who sits there and watches this ""rebel with a pause"" television- these are the type of ""heroes"" Tarantino loves. I don't really care about the plagiarism used in the film, or any film (inless its Van Helsing), i mean we see it every day in every film we see! No contemporary director has stood there on the set and thought ah yeah, no ones EVER done that before, because they get ideas from what they have seen in other films, i mean no one complains when The Simpsons do ""homages"" towards films like Battleship Potemkin, or Psycho, i mean The Simpsons paid ""homage"" to Tarantino 25 times! Honestly! Just shows hes better!"

29 November 2003,inson29,0,1,10,Tarantino's Classic,"After Resivour Dogs, Tarantino brought us this classic that has all the elements can you can expect from a Quentin Tarantino movie. The violence is the main ingredient for this film but this film is hugely entertaining as well as enjoyable. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are simply superb in this film and none of the cast never ever lets you down with their stunning performances. With Kill Bil: Vol 1 in the theaters at the moment, I don't think that film could ever beat this classic here, but still no matter what Tarantino make he somehow never disappoints anyone in films like this one here. If only there were films that could follow the unique style that Tarantino has as a writer and director than we could only bask in the glory of those films."
2 February 2005,zgamer,0,1,8,Well........,"Let's start with a few details. I watched this movie on AMC, so I have not seen it uncut, nor wish to. It's not that the movie was bad, and it wasn't, you can be sure of that. The acting was superb, good story, and its themes are well told. But that's part of the problem. It is definitely a Tarantino movie, with its pervertedly dark messages and graphic violence. And above all else, it had WAY to much language and a majority of them are the F-word. This caused me to like the movie less.But with a strong cast led by John Travolta and the talented Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis, this movie means business, unfortunately Tarantino style."

2 February 2013,GoldenShadow5184,0,1,10,A movie that will stick with you for a very long time!,"Pulp Fiction is a movie which not only grabs the viewers attention throughout the course of the movie, but also makes you beg for more after it is done. Quentin Tarantino definitely knew what he was doing while making this movie. Some people may complain of the way that this movie is presented but with all honesty, it is fairly simple and isn't something like...let's say Inception (which is probably not even relevant to this genre but you know what I'm saying). The best thing about this movie would definitely either be its electric dialog, nonlinear storytelling (which i actually found very interesting in this movie) or its acting. Speaking of the acting, I thought that everyone was excellent, from John Travolta to Tim Roth to Ving Rhames to Harvey Keitel, and even Christopher Walken's single scene in this movie left a lasting impression. Overall, a very good movie with an incredible sense of humor, witty dialog, superb acting, great directing, and is a fun movie for anyone who is looking for a very well-made movie. 10/10"
24 March 2015,MovieLoversAnonymous,0,0,9,Royale with cheese.,"Quentin Tarantino is an absolute artist in the director's chair. Pulp Fiction is such a fun movie to watch. This movie can not be confined by any one genre, much like most of Tarantino's films. Pulp Fiction combines an excellent blend of drama, action, thriller, and a whole lot of comedy.Without giving anything away, there is a scene in this movie where a fatal accident happens to one of the characters on screen, and yet Tarantino manages to make it one of the funniest moments in the entire film. The less I tell you about this movie the better, because if you have not seen this film yet, you are only doing yourself a disservice. However, if you are someone who gets offended easily by foul language, drug use, or brutal violence: please don't watch this. Not for you.On the other hand, if you can take all of that with a grain of salt, you are in for one great ride. This movie includes some of the most unforgettable conversations I've ever seen in a film. How could you not want to watch a movie where John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talk about McDonald's burgers in the middle of a hit man job.You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll clap, and you'll laugh several more times after that. Watch this movie. Absolute brilliance. 9/10"

The direction, camera work is all near perfect and the acting in the movie is superb. It has an excellent beginning in the café robbery scene and the way the movie comes together for each characters own story is brilliantly done. I thought the talk in the car with Jules and Vincent was a brilliant piece of script writing on Tarantino's behalf. The way that so much tension was built up in some scenes was excellent, for example the scene in the guy's apartment at the start was brilliant as we new that they were going to kill him but because it went on for so long with Jules acting so calm gave it's audience an edgy feeling and the brilliant idea to give Jules something to say from the bible before he kills somebody was nothing short of a brilliant idea. Tarantino's work for this movie was brilliant and I have read the script of this movie 3 times and still cannot believe the brilliance of it."

It is without a doubt one of the most popular names in film of all time and for a good reason. Brilliant dialogue, a signature Tarantino non-linear story-line and a connecting ""universe"" with Reservoir Dogs and True Romance make this one of the 3 best Gangster/Crime films of all time. The scene doesn't even need to contain any action for this movie to be good. In the beginning, when the 2 bank robbers are talking at the restaurant, or when Jules and Vince are eating and discussing philosophy you get something that's fun to watch. When you want violence, there's plenty of that. This movie has a few gruesome scenes in particular that will make you turn your head.Add in a fabulous soundtrack, one of the best I may add, and you can easily count this film as one of the best ever made hands down.I strongly recommend you watch Reservoir Dogs and True Romance when you watch this to make it part of a 3 some whose stories all connect.Not as good as Reservoir Dogs but still amazing.10/10"

                        ",A Wild & Crazy Ride!,"PULP FICTION is indeed one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. It starts out in a diner where a man and a woman (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discuss armed robberies. The story is then broken off into three distinct strands: the date between a hit man (John Travolta) and his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), an over-the-hill boxer (Bruce Willis) on the run, and the clean-up of a hit man's mistake. The film returns to the diner scene for its ending sequence.If you saw Quentin Tarantino's first (and better) film, RESERVOIR DOGS, you should have no problem following the events of PULP FICTION, which are not told in chronological order.The performances in the film are outstanding, namely by John Travolta, who shines as tough guy hit man, Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant as Vince's partner, Jules Winfield, who reads a bible passage before he kills his next unsuspecting victim.Another strong point in the film was the good writing, which was also strong in RESERVOIR DOGS.Despite the fact that the film produces one of the grossest scenes I have ever witnessed in a film and a slow-moving middle, PULP FICTION still remains a damn good film, snubbed by the Academy when Oscar time rolled around in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson was well deserving of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film did win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, although. GRADE: A-"
6 September 1999,oscar-50,0,0,10,The path of the righteous man.....,"I don't have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about Pulp Fiction so I'll just give everybody my take on the film and its message. Pulp Fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely understand. Pulp Fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun. First of all I would like to explain the bible verse that Jules reads (Ezekeil 25:17) and how it applies to the story. Jules is ""the righteous man"", Vincent is ""the selfish"", and Marsellus represents ""the tyranny of evil men."" Jules is ""beset on all sides"" by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it. Jules, in the end finds redemption, where Vince and Marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins. This is just one layer of a great story. Perhaps that's the brilliance of Pulp Fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on. Pulp Fiction is the Citizen Kane of the 90's....It has changed filmaking like few others. The acting in Pulp Fiction makes it seem like the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie. Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson give a couple of the finest performances in screen history. The Social satire and Quentin's great direction only fuel the fire. It's just too bad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from Pulp Fiction, because those people are really restricting themselves. Pulp Fiction is my all-tie favorite film and I believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the greatest film ever made. 10 out of 10"

                        ","Winning mainstream acceptance for Tarantino, and rightfully so.","Since the style in which Pulp Fiction is shot amplifies the excellence of the film - all scenes are shown out of sequence - the movie's opening scene is its ending scene as well.We are quickly introduced to two lovers who double as small time thieves. Unfortunately for them, they decide to rob the coffee shop were our main characters are enjoying their coffee and breakfast, Vincent and Jules, who are themselves hit men for a powerful gangster, Marcellus Wallace.And so the story develops, bouncing from different times to different characters we see how each event affects everything else. Character development is a major part in the film. You feel empathy for the characters, whatever those feelings may be, you understand the motives behind their actions.Complete with a Christopher Walken monologue that he has become famous for and brilliant performances from Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis and John Travolta, comedic scenes that you'll be reiterating afterwards and graphic scenes that will keep you up afterwards, this movie is a must for everyone."
2 June 2000,mikhaigh,0,0,9,Brilliant!,"This film is in so many peoples top ten and for a very a hundred good reasons.There is not 1 story but 3, effortlessly intertwined like a woven fabric.The first involves Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber as rather amateur gangsters who have an unusual idea for a heist.The second and dialogue-wise, the best, has John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson as hit men who experiance a few unexpected problems.The third has Bruce Willis in his coolest role as a boxer whose payday has come.What is unusual is that these three story lines cross over each other at certain points and flick backwards and forwards in time, yet at no point (if you are really paying attention) are you confused.What makes this film a cut above all films of the 1990's is the dialogue.Above all it's a Black Comedy, a very black comedy and thats what makes it so cool. To be able to get a laugh out of an audience when you have just shown a needle plunging into someones chest takes some doing.This is the film that made Travolta for a second time, but for me the stars where Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel. Keitel as The Wolf is just magnificent, my favourite part of the film is ""The Connie Situation"" with Keitel as the fast talking fast thinking solver of ""Problems"".Uma Thurman is supercool as the gangsters mol who needs a ""Night out"".I could go on for another 1000 words praising this film so if you are one of the few unfortunates that haven't seen it I think you've by now got the message."
12 November 2005,YoniSade,0,2,10,Pure cinematic joy,"Pulp fiction is just a film you can watch every year and still feel like it's the first time. I don't have much in life, but with movies like this my life seems a little more worth living :) .Tarantino's a walking legend. He really know his work and how to give the viewer enjoyment to the max. From suspense to dark comedy and most important - a closure - one thing that many filmmakers aren't able to achieve.I really hope Tarantino will continue making movies in the current time-spacing he does now. Every project of his is like a child to him, and children aren't something one would make every year.This is just a filler line. I just don't have or need to add about this cool, slick and entertaining piece of cinema."

                        ",Why does everybody worship this movie?,"It is long. It has some great performances. Good dialogue does not a movie make. Good dialogue is for TV and theatre. Good action and story are what counts. Pulp has plenty of both. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Quentin can reinvent himself. I must say, the people who tried to copy him failed badly.One problem when you have carte blanche with the cut and the budget for a movie. There isn't anybody there saying, ""get rid of thirty minutes of mean looks and endless yapping and we'll distrubute it.""I fear the movie will not hold up over the generations because of its' ridiculous length.Travolta, Raymes, Willis and the babe et al were superb. Worth watching just for them."

I know what your thinking, ""Details"", but if you come to think about it, details is the most important. I really love this movie... And the cast! I mean John Travolta, Samuel L.

23 May 2005,sureshthiagarajan,1,2,9,Best of Tarantino's...Innovative to the core! (A must watch movie),"Pulp Fiction (PF)...truly confusing and chaotic in the right sense...is surely one of the all time great movies I have ever seen...Tarantino came up with this movie after a super hit like reservoir dogs, which would have put him under tremendous pressure...Usually if the first movie is a big hit...the second one to follow, though maybe good will not get the acclaim it deserves as it will be naturally compared with its predecessor! But when PF is juxtaposed with Reservoir dogs...it outclasses reservoir dogs with incredible ease! Tarantino is GOD...he is his own competitor! The crisp dialogues, acting to perfection (special mentions - Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and Travolta) hits the mind hard with an intriguing story...the movie is second to none in the decade!!!I feel the selection of actors for their respective roles is incontrovertibly apposite. Very few movies come close when it comes to comparing with the acting of these people in PF! The meticulous direction by Tarantino, supplemented with unsullied acting and commendable music score makes PF a must watch! For me its thumbs up for PF!"
16 July 2001,JulyHizon 18 male,0,1,10,A PART OF OUR AMERICAN CULTURE!!!!!!,"This movie is so famous, believable, and intriging that many rumors are circulated about it as if it were more than just a movie (which is basically all that it is). PULP FICTION is a perfect example of how effective a good film can be while becoming a part of American culture. It's one of those times when you want to seek the director and badger him with questions only to not recieve answers because shallowing a deep masterpiece would only take away the magic. PULP FICTION is not an exercize in creating thick plots but one in creating believable, charasmatic characters. All they do is talk simply because they're cool, funny, charming fictional people whom we love to see talking. The movie's primary way of entertaining us is by showing us how each person talks uniquely. And like every great film, it relies heavily on performance. It's one of my top ten and I give it a ***10****."
16 January 2011,TheSmurphinator,2,10,4,This is not entertainment,"What the heck happened in this film? Yes, we have lovely violence and foul language and one-liners and all those entertaining vices, except where's the plot?! There is none! Whatsoever! Oh wait, let me get out my microscope...We have a few different stories all being played out, except they have next to nothing to do with the next. Basically it's a a few gangsters running around killing people, some couple holding up a restaurant, and a prize fighter having a weird day. While each is entertaining in its own respect, the movie as a whole could not possibly have been more disorganized and poorly thought out. If you finish this movie and are left asking ""And your point is...?"" then you are not alone.Why? Why would you make a movie like this? I think this is one of those hit or miss, love it or hate type of movies. This is not a movie that you just sit down and get entertained by. It's one of those pieces of ""art,"" if you know what I mean.And no this is not a masterpiece of film or in anyway genius. It has a rock star cast which makes things kind of interesting, but this movie is not nearly as good as all of these film sheep shouting ""10/10, amazing, redefined cinema,"" would lead you to believe."
20 June 2001,torturedsoul,0,1,10,A movie that will leave you breathless,"I love Pulp Fiction. There are no two ways about it. From Samuel L. Jackson's hip, but stuck in the 70's gangster to Ving Vhames' big and mean head gangster, this movie provides no shortages of great acting. This movie goes into several parts all kind of coming together in some way or another. John Travola plays, in my opinion, the role of his career as Vincent Vega. He takes out out the head gangster's wife on an almost-fatal date. She snorts herion, and I'll leave it to that. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer. I thought this was a great role for him. He and the head ganster get in a massive fight and the gun-store owner and the sheriff do some repulsive things to the two of them. Christopher Walken has a humorous cameo as the young boxer's father's army buddy. When they kill a man inside their car, Jackson and Travolta go to Quinton Tarantino, who obviously feels a need for acting in his own movies, who in turn calls a ""lets get to business"" type in Harvey Keitel. Keitel does a good job in this role as he does in every role he ever does. The ending is very good, also.
I give it an A+"
11 June 2002,raoul1179,3,13,5,overrated,"Ok, there are some hilarious scenes and good performances in this movie, especially the vignette with Samuel Jackson and John Travolta; their scenes for me were the saving grace for this film.  But I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I thought a lot of the movie dragged and was boring, even with gratuitous violence peppered throughout.   A lot has been made of the non-chronological nature of the plot and the intertwining of the stories but this really didn't add much to the film (as opposed to the unusual chronological layout of Memento which was what made that film so interesting.)  Pulp Fiction seems like a movie that's trying real hard to be cool -- hence lots of violence drugs sex language and more violence -- but ultimately ends up shallow and muddled.  It's a bold and unique movie to be sure... but that in itself doesn't make it a great one.Rating: 5 out of 10."
30 May 2005,ellyattc,1,2,10,Woooooow !!!,"Pulp Fiction: Pulp; poor quality (often sensational) writing orig. printed on rough paper. Fiction; literature,esp. novels, describing imaginary events and people. Well, this film is so good it's hard to believe that it really is fiction! It blew me away. You'll want to see this one again and again.This film has a brilliant cast: John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman etc. It is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest works and in many ways is similar to the new film, Kill Bill(also starring Uma Thurman).You can't miss it!"
1 August 2021,prixilla-12236,0,1,9,It's a classic.,"This is certainly my favourite movie of all time. It's so well done. The plot, the characters, the environment are all singular and perfect. The vibes of this movie are amazing, nothing ever felt like it.You should definitely watch this for 2 reasons:
One: It's a classic, you cannot lose it.Two: It's a singular experience, you will not forget it easily.Go grab popcorns and experience Quentin Tarantino's touch."
28 February 2022,jsnakecarr,0,2,10,Offensive to everyone,"This movie succeeds in offending every group in the entire world. Since then not many movies have pushed to what this movie has done. The whole movie is confusing but you feel rewarded putting together the plotline. The conversations sound real, in other movies conversations are scripted and seem fake, but in Pulp Fiction the conversations between the main character sound like something me and my buddies would talk about. Overall this movie pushed boundaries and changed movies forever."
1 June 2022,enochckchan,0,1,10,The most weirdly weird movie,"It's the best and the most weirdly weird movie I have ever seen. This film doesn't have a straight storyline. It goes around 4 different stories and the plot still seem completed. It's about nothing, but it was able to express something. These kinds of structures usually gets very awkward or gets you very confused, but no, Tarantino exacuted it well. It was very smooth, and indeed very entertaining. The lines were well written, as they don't have many meanings. They seem very useless but they really can bring out the ridiculousness and the absolute funny weirdness of the film. And that's why it was very enjoyable, like the Le Big Mac and the Royal with Cheese. And the characters were so good at playing their roles. John Travolta as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia...They were just perfect. I don't know what to say about this movie anymore. It's a magnificent piece of art. It's about nothing, it's so weird, and you will definitely enjoy it."

Uma Thurman, Travolta Willis, all give great performances and should be commended for their acting. Truly a great film with two performances that stand up in my opinion...Even though not much time in the movie I thought Ving Rhames did a good job as Marcellus (Spelling?) but my real favorite performances is Harvey Keital as The Wolf. Gosh I wish I could act so cool and calm as he did. Then there's Samuel L. Jackson as Jules.... great performance, and his best scene is in the diner talking to Tim Roth's character... really memorableQuentin Tarantino did a great job with this film, I saw this film after I saw resevoir dogs (Which is also good) and I can see his skills had improved.... although Jackie Brown was not all that great... I hope he picks back up with Kill Bill. Good Job Mr. Tarantino"

Showing with realistic scenes and dialog the underworld life in LA, Pulp Fiction shows what true brilliance is. The music is fantastic, the cast are fantastic, particularly from Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, and Willis in his best role.I have watched Pulp Fiction many times, and it still makes me flinch when Jules holds up the gun at Brett (I think that's his name, he was played by Frank Whaley), while reciting the Bible passage, it still makes me sick when Mia Wallace does that thing (I won't say because the nice people at IMDb might consider it a spoiler, but its nothing sexual), and it still makes me laugh with the conversations between Jules and Vincent (aka: the foot massage thing, eating bacon)."
28 October 2003,flipboy923,0,1,10,...great movie...,"...John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and many other great actors fill in the roles of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  A great story told out of sequence, Tarantino brings his unique wit and sense of humor and lays it out on screen with the story of two hitmen, their boss and wife, a boxer, two criminals, and a mysterious suitcase.  It's difficult to explain how this movie is, but it certainly is unforgettable, the dialogue alone is so unique and fresh that you'll be repeating it to others for days.  For those of you that want something different from usual Hollywood productions, Pulp Fiction is definitely something to watch..."
9 May 2006,ciuca,0,1,10,One of the most creative and entertaining films I've ever seen.,"Pulp Fiction is a movie starring Oscar nominee John Travolta (from Saturday Night Fever) and Samuel L. Jackson (from True Romance). It is directed by Quentin Tarantino, who previously directed Reservoir Dogs. This has got to be one of the best films I have ever seen. The whole thing is geniusly put together, amazingly acted, and creatively directed.The dialogue in this movie is the cleverest dialogue I have ever seen in a film. It's the type of conversations that you would have every day with your best friend. Even if it is random, who cares? Tarantino is a great director. He uses some amazing camera angles, which at some point reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. And the film being out of order keeps you interested throughout the whole film.I think this is a must-see because it's so entertaining and, plus, it's a classic that everyone has to see at some point in their lives. And, plus, it answers all those questions you have burning inside you. ""You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?"""
26 May 2018,sesquicentennial,1,3,7,Artistically sound but doesn't age well,"Certainly a monumental film, with some great character developments and a uniquely woven storyline; however, after watching this film a few years later, I can't help but think that Tarantino was just coming up with excuses to pepper the film with derogatory racial terminology."
11 August 2005,InpraiseofFolly,0,1,7,Great Dialogue,"This movie probably has the best dialogue I've ever seen in a movie. It's just so very funny movie. It has a very subtle sense of the ridiculous which I find works more than crude punchlines or slapstick. Everything about is so ""cool"" and ""hip"" that although it's about 2 hours long and doesn't really contain that much action , there is a fluidity about it that doesn't make it seem as long. I did enjoy the interwoven scenes and the lack of chronology but I would have really liked a less anti-climatic ending. I found myself waiting after the credits just to be sure there wasn't an added scene at the end that would pull everything together. I do think it's a tiny bit overrated , but it's still an interesting film to watch. 7/10"
3 October 2005,elvato87,0,2,10,The best film in history,"Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly the best film that I have ever seen. The movie will have you reciting quotes from the movies for a long time. The film is cleverly broken into 4 interlocked tales, and the time line is broken apart, and re-arranged. The chemistry between the cast members is obvious, and the film profits from that. Tarantino invents stories that only he could have thought up. The film does not center around one character, but rather, around the events of the movie. It presents a lot of dark comedy, and uses symbolism to add to the dramatic effect of the film. Finally, the dialog is fantastic. The characters debate semantics throughout the film, and you will be laughing long after each debate, and you'll be memorizing the dialog before long. Bottomline, A+++++++; 11/10; 1,000 stars. It is the best film in history."
24 November 2008,markors13,2,11,4,At least it beats reservoir dogs,"If you've read my reservoir dogs review, you'll know that I hate that retarded down-syndrome, Quentin Tarantino. NO Talent!!.This is slightly better, with more 3d characters and better action, but still too structured and i don't get the significance of the rape scene...1 star for Tim Roth 1 star for Harvey Keitel 1 star for the way the time is shifted and 1 star g=cos i'm grateful it didn't get an Oscar :) (to be honest, forest gump is crap as well).The music was decent, but Tarantino's just lucky that he's whipped up a cult of brain-dead moron's who find his films amusing rather than just sick and perverse.Watch it if u want, but i think its crap."

24 February 2006,gobbles_the_penguin,0,2,10,brilliant,"Allow me to start by saying this is my second favourite movie, which is a fine compliment in itself, (if i do say so myself!) Quintin Tarantino is the master of the dialogue perpetuated movie. In saying that, pulp fiction doesn't shy away from the bloodier confrontations either, but it conducts itself with good humour and plenty of deep story lines where at the end of each short story, the characters are always questioning...""well....what now?"" Tarantino's style in his writing is very original, as i said, a crime movie with more clever dialogue pieces than bullets is an impressive feat.Tarantino's directing carries plenty of traces of 70's crime flicks which he openly admits that he was a massive fan of. John Travolta is the king of the screen, but it is Samuel L Jackson's character that i get closest too, and i have the utmost respect for Tim Roth as an actor, especially after his role in another brilliant Tarantino film 'Reservoir Dogs'.Pulp Fiction is one of those films that you must see, you haven't watched true brilliance until you see Tarantino doing his finest work, (but personally, i think he should leave the acting to the pro's!) must see, 10/10!"

                        ",Fantastic Film--Serves as excellent social critique...,Pulp Fiction serves as an excellent social critique of the seeming glamorous drug and crime world. Jackson and Travolta were excellent. I will always think twice about pawn shops--seeing as how some may have the Gimp tied up in the basement. My only question is what was the glowing content(s) in that all important briefcase Jules carried around? It is never shown directly--but appears to give off some form of hypnotic light as noted when it is displayed for the would-be diner robber at the end of the movie.
25 November 2005,chhubbydumpling,1,2,9,I was 11,"When I first saw this movie I was 11. Had no idea what I was in for. The scene with Bruce and the Katana(Sp?) just made me love film. This film and Shawshank are the best films I've ever seen. Tarantino knows exactly the right order to put the stories in. THe ending of one story just leads right into the beginning of the next and at the end you just find yourself attempting to put them all together. Uma Thurman does a great job as does John Travolta. The pairs of actors in this film are wonderful. When Samuel gives his memorized verse, you just want to hide behind something because you feel that he's yelling at YOU. The violent scenes are believable, just as in ""Reservoir Dogs."" Overall I would say that EVERYONE should see this movie. It was so awesome the first time I saw it and every time it plays on Bravo, I watch it. If you have seen Die Hard, Reservoir Dogs, or any of the Kill Bill movies and liked them, then you will love this film."
18 April 2007,hollywoodhorrorchick,0,2,10,classic !,"Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies of all time. I honestly don't know what I can write that hasn't already been said about it hundreds of times, but I feel inclined to add myself to the list of those who feel it is one of those rare pieces of art that just works perfectly on all levels. Jules and Vincent, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, Marsellus Wallace, Mia, and Butch are the most colorful group of characters ever to share the screen. Thirteen years later, this is still the endlessly intriguing cinematic powerhouse it has always been. Tarantino is a genius, and this is his first masterpiece. The concept, script, and style are completely unlike anything before and anything since."

16 July 2001,kylerkl,0,1,8,A True Gem,"Pulp Fiction is not another alternative film or a cult classic, but an experience in detecting what truth can be gleaned from each situation in our lives and dispelling all that is not real. It is a quest to find what each of us wants, needs, and desires. Character development is covered in multiple layers and each character evolves within the film, making it difficult to capture all of the subtle nuances in one viewing. The defining mark of this film is the use of extremely real characters surrounded by absurd life situations. This is in high contrast to the majority of filmmaking in Hollywood, which seeks to place hollow shells in very spectacular or realistic environs. Each person met seems like someone you know. Their manner, speech, or thoughts never betray them as empty husks contrived to fill space in a film. The use of vignettes is masterful and adds to the importance of each scene and to the scope of each characters life and their interdependence with one another. The film does contain severe violence, copious explicatives, heavy drug themes and an explicit rape scene. A good film to watch with a group of people, leading to discussion afterward. What was in the briefcase?"

I don't know how many times I have seen this film, but I now see it's so much more.  It's a rich intertextual film going experience. It's a gangstar movie. For lack of a stronger term, it's a black comedy. It's a renegade boxer story.  It's 'Easy Rider', 'Deliverance' and 'Shaft'. It's a film noir, it's a melodrama. It's romance and action.  Its narrative flow is not just novel, but near genious. If Tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career, this would definitely be the one."
6 January 2022,bonnieclyde-39896,0,0,9,Definitely one of my all time favorites,"Personally this is my favorite Tarrentino film. The cast makes this movie, without any of them not having well developed characters, this project wouldn't have gotten off the ground. Well written screenplay and great directing. I still believe it should have won the Oscar for Best Movie in 1995, however, like any industry, people play politics and favorites."
19 April 2002,boris82,0,1,8,The perfect film,"Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is pure perfection. Not only is it highly original, humorous it also has no plot holes. And that's amazing considering it's warped time line.It's quite rare to have a film so free of holes. The only thing I can think of is that the adrenaline needle scene is pure imagination. Mia would have not awaken from that because the needle would never pierce her chest bone.Everything else though is terrific. This film is much better than the rancid Reservoir Dogs that featured colorful but unnecessary dialogue.Pulp's dialogue had a clever way of foreshadowing future events in the film. Example:1)The foot message scene including the discussion of the diabolical fate suffered by Tony Rocky Horror was a prelude to Mia's overdose. If Tony got nearly killed for touching Mia's feet, what would happen to Vincent after Mia O.D's?Another trick that QT has bestowed on us through his dialogue is softening our expectations for carnage and violence by having his characters discuss Royal With Cheeses and TV Pilots right before Vince and Jules quickly kill 4 guys in an apartment.Great picture. Long live QT and renegade cinema."

And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis."
19 January 2022,ohrimen,0,0,9,What in the box,"Every year, n-th number of films are released on the screen. The public craves novelty, directors - big box office, actors - fame. 1994 is the year of the ""rich harvest"" in cinema, which gave the films: ""Forrest Gump"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Crow"", ""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Leon"", ""Mask"", ""Maverick"", etc. Same ""Pulp Fiction"" - not sewn with a bast. It's about him now.Once, a long time ago, Miramax Films, then the middle peasant in the film industry, suddenly became one of the recognized Hollywood leaders. Magic? No, it's far from magic, everything is easy and simple here. A good idea ... A plan created by Mr. Extraordinary himself ... And his name is Quentin Tarantino.I. Quentin Tarantino is a psychopath and a genius. Or why you should watch this movie. Part I1991:Tarantino? Which one is Tarantino?1992:Tarantino? Is this the same psycho who filmed the bloody mess called ""Reservoir Dogs""? You know, I think he can make movies!1994:Tarantino? Yes, I know who it is and I hope that you will never ask me about it again, because I will forever remember who Quentin Tarantino is and his name will forever go down in the history of cinema as the name of the most extraordinary director who gave the world ""Pulp Fiction"" "".Our days:Tarantino? Yes, I still remember him.Someone considers Quentin Tarantino a psycho, obsessed with cruelty, blood, drugs and booze. Someone thinks that Quentin Tarantino is a genius who knows how to make unique films that produce the effect of an exploding bomb. For me, Tarantino has always been and will remain a psycho genius. If he weren't a genius, he wouldn't have written the screenplay for Pulp Fiction with Roger Avery and wouldn't have won an Oscar for it, because academics aren't stupid. Academics can be disliked for some things, but if they decide to give such an honorary award to America's most famous psycho ... then this is the first reason to watch Pulp Fiction. Although, the presence of any Oscar for a film is not always an indicator, but the honorary statuette awarded to Tarantino, in my opinion, is absolutely deserved. Probably, the question arises: ""Why not a word about Tarantino as a psycho""? Yes, because only such a psycho as Tarantino could write a script for this film ... Many people ask the question: ""Why didn't they give an Oscar for directing?"" Yes, because then the most talented director Robert Zemeckis shot the most beautiful film ""Forrest Gump"" ..."

                        ",Brilliant masterpiece of gang film proportions!,"Very few films today bring a true feeling of realism to the silver screen. Most modern-day efforts are made up of scattered plot points and cheesy popular culture, which leaves viewers with a hollow, bored feeling.(This applies only to serious movie-goers) But every once in a while, a film comes along that has characters that work so effectively that it literally consumes your thoughts and emotions. One such film, is Pulp Fiction. The plot of this film will totally envelope your interests and eventually bring you to a point of understanding why the characters do what they do.The cast of this film is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen. Everyone(down to the smallest player)in this film is a recognizible Hollywood actor/actress. And each of the personas are remarkably believable. What I mean by this is that when you see Vincent Vega on screen,(mobster; Travolta's character) you don't see John Travolta performing as the character Vincent Vega, you see Vincent Vega. The same goes for the rest of the cast.The soundtrack is another high-note for this film. The music for this film sets the mood perfectly for every scene of this masterpiece. From the Spanish sounding, Tango inspired ""Miserloo"" beginning to the soulful sounds of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" permeating in the barroom scene, this film's soundtrack soars high over any big orchestra crescendo.The story takes place in L.A., one of the most crime-ridden cities known to man. The story surrounds two hitmen, two disgruntled bank robbers, a crime boss and his wife, and a burned out boxer at the end of his career.I would love to blabber on about what happens in this brilliant indie film, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone who has yet to see it. All I can do as a faithful servant of the cinema is to highly recommend this film to all film-goers. It is quite a long film that is broken into chapters, so if you find it hard to follow the movie ""Memento"" (which I also highly suggest)you should just watch this movie several more times and pay closer attention!!! Please, do yourself the favor of a lifetime and see this movie!"

                        ",Over Rated!,"This movie shouldn't be in the top 250 movies. Maybe the top 1000. This movie was 2 1/2 hours to long, the editing was just ugly. The acting was good, but the direction of the movie was lost. The only reason this movie is in the top 250 is because of all the violence! Nothing more! This movie should have won a Razzie Award, for worst movie."
4 January 2009,traveleralex,0,1,9,Gotta love it,"Pulp Fiction is not only Quentin Tarantino's finest movie, it surely can be considered one of the best ever, specifically in the gangster genre. This movie shows clearly that even gangsters are human, they wonder about hamburgers, and know just when to say something witty and unexpected.It is difficult to really classify this movie as it is both quite funny but deals with generally serious matter and contains quite a lot of violence. However, it is safe to say that it doesn't really matter what kind of movie this is or what it means (if it means anything). All that matters is that the acting, story, and great dialogs are played out to perfection.I'd say Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies of all time, but why that is I still have yet to figure out. I guess it's just that good."
13 August 2003,Basketcase247,0,1,10,Quentin shows his genious side,"Quentin Tarrantino has become famous for making funny, film-noir type films. Tarrantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was also a great critically aclaimed film.But Pulp Fiction truly blows you away. At 154 min., this movie can truly be called an epic. With its intertwining twist of a plot, to it's constant changing in the timelines, Pulp Fiction is a movie that you watch over and over again, finding something new to treasure every time. Tarrantino won an oscar for his offbeat, yet very attractive screenplay. As in Reservoir Dogs, it shows that gangsters are able to talk about things like pop culture, or McDonalds and the metric system. Pulp also introduced Tarrantino to box office success, making one hundred million dollars in theaters.All the characters, including two hitmen(John Travolta and Smauel L. Jackson), their boss(Ving Rhames), their boss's wife(Uma Thurman), a down-on-his-luck boxer(Bruce Willis), two diner robbing thugs(Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), and a ""special"" clean up man named Wolfe(Harvey Keitel). Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman all were nominated for oscars, but all fell short. Travolta understandably lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, but Jackson's academy award was stolen away by old-timer Martin Landau for Ed Wood.Tarrantino was also nominated for his directing, and Pulp Fiction got the Best Picture nomination. Both of these, lost to the other great film of '94, Forrest GumpPulp Fiction has become one of the biggest cult movies off all time. Most thought Tarrantino could do no better than Reservoir Dogs, but he truly proved them wrong, and blew them away in the process. If you ever rent Pulp Fiction, you'll find yourself watching it, atleast five times. Whether it's trying to find out what's in the briefcase, or just mezmerized with the film itself, you will watch it again.9 and fourth/10 stars"
16 April 2003,OppressedWriter,0,1,10,"A superb amalgamation of virtuoso film-making, and audacious bravado.","What can one say that hasn't been said about ""Pulp Fiction"": the dialogue is fresh, the narrative is brilliant, the acting is superlative, etc.  All these praises are merely opinions, but one has to be completely ignorant to deny the influential aspects of ""Pulp Fiction.""  A film that was the catalyst for the independent film generation.  It is the film that defied Hollywood's preconceived notion--that all films needed to be molded from an archetype.  ""Pulp Fiction"" single handedly reinvigorated a genre inept, and bereft of creativity.  Simply put, ""Pulp Fiction"" is the best film of the 90's;  much like ""Citizen Kane"" is regarded as the best film of all time. Both films cinematic aspects can be argued, but one would be hard pressed to deny the level of their influence."

I've never watched a film that brought so many elements in, and put them together in such a amazing, and successful way.The acting is good, the dialog is the best i've seen, and the boundary pushing is almost unseen of in other films. They didn't bush barriers, they stomped them down, and raped them.It's the darkest comedy you'll ever see, and it's obviously not for everyone. If you enjoy movies like Bruce Almighty, Click, Toy Story, and Home Alone, but hate movies like Zach and Miri make a Porno, Shortbus, and A Clockwork Orange than do NOT watch this.

I like Tarantino's films because there is always something extra involved in the film that you might not notice until you see it a fourth of fifth time. I enjoyed ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" very much. I am still yet to see ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" What i like about ""Reservoir Dogs"" and especially in ""Pulp Fiction"" is that the beginning of the movie is the end of the movie.

4 October 2004,car-nune,0,1,10,Extraordinary array of creative genius,"Tarantino has a personal style which is no doubt unique. This film, in particular, is most impressive in its use of dialogue and scenery. As is much noted in certain works on Tarantino, the script in his films extraordinary, because it implies deep conversations in topics that are not entirely related with the plot. It is like a window that pours fresh air inside the structure of the story. The dialogue between Vincent Vega and Jules concerning hamburgers (""Royale with Cheese"") is a classic. Also, the music is very well picked for the scenes and the mood. Tarantino is definitively the most recent revelation in the American panorama, and his movies will be deeply studied in future times. God bless Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction."

27 October 2007,Artistic_Differences,0,1,10,Beautiful.,"It's a classic. I think it's a classic. One that was not made to be one, that's not pretentious, that doesn't follow some secret formula to be fun, intelligently-written and intense. I've read a lot of theories on the ongoing themes: but I don't believe it was made to overanalyze, to have one thousand cryptic messages, but yes to spot something new to love every time you watch it.I love it, I think it deserves every ounce of fame it ever got, but I don't think it is undoubtedly Tarantino's masterpiece  I happen to think his filmography *is* the masterpiece itself, that how we should see his work is as a whole. But Pulp Fiction is definitely a high point.It *is* the movie that defined the director's style the most. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's chat about robbing banks as if they were talking about the weather; a cheap-looking, greasy John Travolta discusses Big Macs and foot massages with Samuel L. Jackson on their way to a mass murder; every character is human in the most fictitious way possible, in a movie that never pretends to about real life, just created to be an extremely fun ride.The stories are top-notch.The second story, starring Bruce Willis, was my favourite. From all the scenes that make it memorable, I'm just going to mention the introduction: about two minutes of Christopher Walken, as one certain Captain Koons, eloquently delivering one of Tarantino's famous riffs, fairly more intense than the man himself ranting about Like a Virgin in Reservoir Dogs, better even that Dennis Hopper's astounding performance in True Romance. Only Christopher Walken could make something involving ""watch up one's arse"" all transcendental and unforgettable.It's this thing Tarantino has that made, makes him different from every other screenwriter and director. He takes advantage of the personalities he's gifted to write, to the last drop: fills dialogue with unique essence which only pertains to the character who's talking, makes them human in their own little ways.Uma Thurman is particularly worthy of mention as Mia Wallace the criminal boss' wife, who Travolta gets to take out for a rather intense night. In an interview, Q mentions how, discussing personal aspects of Mia's character with another, unspecified actress who would most probably be earning the role, he felt like he was cheating on Thurman: how could he be discussing her with someone else, if Uma *was* Mia? And honestly, head to toe, she was the perfect choice. Nobody else could have nailed that character, her dry sharpness, the silent chemistry between her and Travolta's Vincent.Some have regarded this movie as a step back from Quentin's first. I think it may have aged a little *too* well, in that hardly anybody acknowledges what that movie meant back in 1995. It may look like it doesn't have that edge of freshness, of ""somebody just *wanted* to make this so much it's maniacal"" that Reservoir Dogs had: but it isn't pretentious, it's a movie to lay back and watch without over-analyzing. And for that, I think I deserves to be Top #5 and more."
26 July 2006,athleticz20022000,0,2,10,Best film of the 90's,"Following several interlocked tales of criminals, ""Pulp Fiction"" is about as well-written, well-acted, and well-directed as any film out there. The first storyline centers around Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta), who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). The second story line focuses on Vincent taking Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) to dinner, and the final storyline is about Wallace bribing a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) to take the fall is a boxing match. Of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order, but going through everything that happens would take a while. Tarantino won a Best Screenplay Oscar, but the movie should have won many more awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), and Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman). In most years, I would say that John Travolta should have won the Best Actor Oscar, but I give the nod to Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"". The acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere. Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvy Keitel and Eric Stoltz are all terrific. The only sub par performance is that of Tarantino himself. The style of direction that Tarantino uses is one of those ""love it or hate it"" kinds. If you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character, than you will like Tarantino's style of direction. In conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is the best movie made in the 90's, barely edging out ""The Silence of the Lambs"" for the crown. I was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time, but after sitting through it, there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out. This is a film that once you see, you will want to watch over and over again. That is the true sign of a masterpiece."
10 June 2006,pixiepetal-1,1,3,10,Tarantino's Best,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was in college--at the time it was one of the few movies I had seen more than once in the theatre. Since then, it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time. The script, editing, directing, and cinematography are all top notch, and the acting reaches heights of excellence. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis--all of these individuals are excellent actors at any time, but this movie truly highlights their talents. I especially enjoy Jackson in this movie--more so than in any other. The people who are hung up on the violence and profanity in this movie simply miss the point--this movie is meant for those with an open mind, a great sense of humor, and a true appreciation of cinematic excellence. Clearly, this movie's detractors should stay home and watch ""Seventh Heaven""."
12 September 2017,nickykelly-65134,0,0,10,Brilliant Piece of Crime Cinema,"In my opinion, this is the best thing to come from Quentin Tarantino's mind, and one of the most unique film ever made, although ironically borrowing a lot from other films.The strongest part of the film's story telling isn't that it has a particularly emotional or epic plot, but rather the way in which the film's stories are told. Tarantino decides to take the film's story and present it out of chronological order, and although things like this have been done before, no film as done it quite as perfectly as Pulp Fiction. This non linear structure allows for Tarantino to make the film uber-rewatachable and incredibly unpredictable to first time viewers, making the film much more compelling to watch. If Tarantino didn't use this structure, the film may have still had great dialogue and great scenes, but it wouldn't be half the film it is now.Another great strength of this film is it's script, which has to go down as one of the best film scripts ever written. The dialogue is perhaps the most entertaining part of the enter movie, as the two leads (John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson) carry their scenes excellently with their back and forth dialogue. Tarantino also manages to use this quick and witty dialogue in some of the film's most intense scenes such as when Jules and Vincent take their boss's briefcase back from Brett, and the film's climax scene in the coffee shop.Overall, this is masterpiece of non-linear storytelling, dialogue and originality, and this film deserves all the fame and awards that it did receive, and perhaps more."

How hard is it to show someone getting their brains blown out of their butts 50 times per second and write dialogue based solely on one word four letters long beginning with the letter F. That combined with repeated use of the ""n"" word?  Come on, you people should be outraged at such a racist film.  That alone should be enough.Now, I've only seen the clippings, and not the entire film from start to finish, I'll admit.  And I know that a lot of you are saying, ""Emperor, how do you know that you hate this movie if you haven't seen the whole thing?""  Well, I've never been drawn and quartered, either.  You see, I thought clippings were supposed to make you WANT to see a movie.  And the ones I saw for this movie turned me off to it.Mr. Tarantino, you don't NEED to find new and creative ways to kill someone, or use the ""f"" word every three seconds to make a great film.  In fact, the ones that keep that stuff to a minimum are usually the ones that do the best at the box office.  No, I'm not saying that you should make everything all happy and perfect and ""Leave it to Beaver-""esque, because things should be believable on film.  However, what is real is NOT always a depressing drag.  Why don't you just TRY this idea and see if I'm not right?Also, if you're in doubt as to what will work for a particular scene, project, etc., just check your W.W.E.D.

27 January 1999,Smartass-Dumbass,0,0,9,A perfect- simple to understand enigma of a film,"I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same."

                        ","no, it's trash","The cool guy attitudes and casual violence appeal to people who had an arrested adolescence.  Tarantino is the king of geeks, which is probably why Roger Ebert kisses up to him so gratuitously.  This is an awful flashy purely superficial movie that's made for jerks with attention deficit disorder."
31 May 1999,DCAndy,0,0,10,watch it twice!,"Pulp Fiction turns a lot of people off at first with its violence and its nonlinear plot, but on subsequent viewings the movie improves by leaps and bounds. Every time you watch it you will catch more nuances, you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. I'm not even talking about Tarantino (even though I feel this is his best.) Watch how many details the actors put into their roles, the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman are obvious standouts, and Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel are also quite good. Christopher Walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. So even if you didn't care for it the first time, give it another try. And if you liked it the first time, buy a copy and watch it until it wears out (like mine just did!)"

11 August 1999,Clariztbel,0,0,10,Wonderful Movie!,"I just have to say Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is funny, creative, satirical and intelligent; and though I like Reservoir Dogs more, Pulp Fiction is not too far away of being as great as that.

Tarantino did a great job! I liked the great dialog the most, especially from Rhames (character Marsellus Wallace) and Jackson (character Jules Winnfield). But the best performance is from John Travolta, who plays the gangster Vincent Vega. The whole attitude of this character is very real and interesting. The whole movie is about 145 minutes long, but I stayed entertained all the way! One of the greatest movies ever!!"

18 March 2000,three19,1,2,10,Best Movie Ever Made.,"I remember movies BP(Before Pulp), they were boring, dull, and lame retreads of one another. Then a movie about two hit men, a boxer, a mob boss and his wife, a gold watch and a suitcase came along and restored my faith in film. There are only two flaws in Pulp. The scenes w/Butch and Fabion drag a little and the movie ends. One complaint that I often hear is that people don't understand what the movie was about. The movie is about Redemption plain and simple. Some people don't see it but it is there. I still remember the first time I saw it and I kept trying to figure out where the movie was going. I was wrong everytime I guessed. Another great thing about it is that each story can work independently of each other. I've watched the three stories separately and still enjoy each one of them. My favourite story is ""The Bonnie Situation"". Much needed comic relief after ""The Gold Watch"". Great stories, great script, great cast, great music and simply the best movie ever made."

In my opinion none of his movies are worth watching, with the exception of maybe Reservoir Dogs, but even that's a stretch of the imagination.So many say that it's the greatest movie of all time, however it is one of 2 movies that have ever actually put me to sleep because it was THAT boring! FYI the other was Two Hands. For what it's worth, I have tried twice to re-watch Pulp Fiction, and the second time I did watch it fully, but I still conclude that it's the biggest waste of time one could possibly inflict on another person! Watching paint dry is far more entertaining!"

Speaking of which it is very upsetting that they killed of Vincent the way they did but oh well what am i going to do it was entertaining most of the time and the story wasn't bad at all
5 April 2020,leohsanchez,0,6,4,One big snob dream,"Just that. A pointless movie: no message, no real story, nothing deep or even interesing. I have to admit, the dinamic between the main characters is somehow catchy, but no more than that. This is a film for snob people, just that. If you love Tarantino no matter what, you gotta love it. This is not even the best Tarantino movie."
27 May 2001,austin6174,0,1,10,My All-Time Favorite Movie,"Pulp Fiction has everything that you can want from a movie: A great story with great characters, great actors, a great director & 2 hours and 40 minutes of film that keeps you glued to the screen.  Quentin Tarantino brilliantly weaves together 3 stories to make a film that is a true masterpiece.  The dialogue is truly excellent and the acting from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and many others is outstanding.  I highly recommend this film and give it 10/10 stars."
14 September 2006,thetruecell,1,3,10,It means a lot to me.,"I first saw this movie when I was 14, and I still remember it as being the movie that made me realize just how much I loved movies. It also started a love affair with Quentin Tarantino that lasts to this day. The movie was well paced, and even though it was presented out of sequence, it wasn't too hard to follow along. The characters were interesting and compelling, and you cared about them despite the fact that most of them weren't very nice people. But more that anything, this movie proved to me that with the right characters, the right script, and the right director a movie can be so powerful and compelling that it can leave us in love with it after the very first viewing. I may be biased. I have seen this movie well over 90 times. (Once a month, like clockwork.) I can often say the lines in the movie in time with the characters, and I am known to quote Sam Jackson's scene from the apartment word for word. But just because I may be a little obsessed doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth every second I've spent with it. If you haven't seen it, run and buy it! Don't just rent it, buy it! If you are a fan of film noir, buy it! If you like movies with a realistic feel, buy it! It will more than likely be a purchase you won't regret."
14 July 2001,Stevestg,0,1,9,Gets better every time...,I just watched it again and I enjoyed it as much if not more than the first! The humor amongst the violence is done in such a way it causes such mixed emotion that I feel like I've been on a great roller coaster by the end! Tarantino pulled something off that is rarely done well in film.  I think this is one of the most enjoyable and creative movies ever made!
1 February 2021,wumble-33320,0,0,9,amazing but one thing tips me off,"The film is amazing the characters the scenery, how the story is broken up into parts but is somehow connected, but the one thing that cuts me off is Vincent Vega death, not only does it not make sense why Marsellus Wallace would send him only to kill gimp but it totally unnecessary to have him killed since nothing exciting or important transitions in that scene and how it plays off afterwards"
13 December 2000,f_dediu,1,2,10,Short impression,PULP FICTION must be the most representative combination between an well directed gangster movie and a smooth black comedy. The originality of the script as well as the directing manner makes this film obligatory seen by those who can appreciate a good 7-art work!
27 September 2021,HuntersFilmReviews,0,0,10,Tarantino's Masterpiece,"I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time back in February (7 months ago) and ever since then about every month I want to rewatch it. I haven't fulfilled this need every month but I have seen the movie a total of 4 times now, and I gotta say, it gets more fun each time. After 3 times watching it I kind of felt like a pro and on my fourth time watching it I found myself quoting nearly every line and laughing my ass off. The first time watching Pulp Fiction you feel many different emotions. As you watch it more those emotions get stronger and stronger and the film gets more enjoyable. Quentin Tarantino truly crafted one of the most unique and re-watchable films of all time. I love and adore Pulp Fiction so much. Please, watch it now."
27 March 2005,phoenix-ks,1,4,10,The Best Movie Ever!,This is the best movie of all time. Simply put it is perfect. Between having the best script ever perfect performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson) and the best directing ever this movie becomes a flawless cinematic masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino revolutionizes film-making with this masterpiece. And has one of the greatest collection of characters ever who feel almost as real as if you knew them thanks to the fantastic dialogue. One example of this is the 2 hit-man Vincent and Jules they don't feel like to coldblooded killers they feel like real people talking about such things as foot massages and McDonald's in Europe. Pulp Fiction has spawned a million ripoffs but none can even come close to the greatness and magnificence of Pulp Fiction. This is the best movie ever and my favorite and i don't think any movie will change that. If you haven't seen this movie you need to stop whatever your doing and go buy and watch this movie.

19 January 2022,bogatchnick,0,1,10,Immortal classics,"Pulp Fiction"" has partly gone down in history as the movie that revived John Travolta's career, but it's more than that. A look into the lives of several criminals, it's likely to shake up almost anyone. The first time that I ever saw the movie, my dad (who'd already seen it) sent me out of the room for the scene where Bruce Willis...well, I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).All in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy."

But it's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, it just has something that makes it special, it makes you laugh, it makes you feel worried, it makes you feel mad and glad. It has everything. Definitely a must."
9 May 2002,kostas papageorgiou,0,2,6,Too cool - literally,"I have my problems with this movie and the enormous hype it created. First of all, let´s clarify some things: Yes, it has excellent acting and directing; the dialogues are superbly written and often hilarious; the music is... well, you know, especially if you were in college in the late nineties; it has many clever and (relatively) original storylines.Still, my biggest problem is exactly what´s supposed to be the movie´s greatest asset: the atmosphere it creates. So many critics mention the violence, and the argument of the fans is always: there´s not so much violence in there, other movies have way more and way harder violence. Well, it´s neither the quantity nor the viciousness that bother me. It´s the fact that violence is really, really cool in this movie. Pulp Fiction made violence and murder to mainstream coolness. Many great films have cynically shown bare violence and thus made their points about society, relationships, human nature etc. In this case, there´s no point to be made - and please, I don´t just mean a moral point. The PF characters are neither good nor bad, neither tragic nor pitiful, they´re barely human. All they are is cool. Cool caricatures. And that´s just not enough for me in order to be really moved by a movie.PF had a perfect timing, as mentioned in another recent review. However, I sincerely hope it won´t be viewed upon as the ultimate nineties icon in the future - the nineties weren´t just about senseless violence and cool comments; there was much more, and it was way better."

                        ",A classic...,"Incredibly original and entertaining movie. Director Q.T. really pulled off what Kevin Smith failed to do in Clerks -- Combine great actors with a very intelligent script (& plenty of witty dialogue). Although the script gets just a tad pretentious at times (do real hitmen speak this way and about these subjects? Probably not), the movie's certainly worth the watching. Rent/buy it!"
14 December 2006,raiyanm,1,3,10,Amazing...,"Amazing.I watched every second of this movie and was not bored at all. It had fabulous acting performances from Travolta and Jackson, good supporting cast like Thurman and Willis, the slick dialogues, natural realistic suspense, groovy soundtracks and a series of long camera shots. This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made. Standout performance was Samuel L.Jackson with his cool gangster charm and quick wit. This movie deserved the Oscar for best picture and never got it. Very sad. Jackson also deserved an Oscar. But again didn't get it. It was amazing that how entertaining the dialogue was. Even when there was no words, natural silence was just as addictiveA very much deserved 10/10."

1 January 2009,clauslykkebo,0,1,10,Damn good movie! Watch it!,"I seriously love that movie! One of the best films i've ever seen. The way story is split up in parts mixed in what first seems to be disordered but by the way the ends is tied together. It make you realize the connections in a way so you aren't conscious. Suddenly a connection is made and in the end it all ends up in a perfectly shaped nontrivial (cf. mathematical term in knot theory) knot with two free ends. The beginning and the end. It really gets you. And it's filled with points. Maybe some of them is bit affected, some would say, others is very clear. E.g. Jules ends up quiting and Vincent continues and who ends up dead: Vincent, which I by the way think is a bit sad, but go Bruce ;). But back to the point Jules is the kind of guy you should be, rough but also right. Not saying Vincent is a bad character he's just not that rational as Jules (but that's just my opinion)! I won't talk about all the technical stuff we all know that and can watch it for ourselves. I just want to say I love this movie! So if you haven't seen it yet then do it now! :D"
24 August 2006,lodi_70005,1,4,9,What do people expect?,"Few films have the ability to cover the whole ""grade"" spectrum, however, leave it to Tarantino to pull it off. I have read many comments on this film and if I didn't know any better I would have to use the term controversial to describe Quentin Tarantino. What other word could better describe a film that receives icon status with the obligatory perfect 10 rating from a reviewer only to be followed by a ""bomb"" 1 or 2 rating. Well, I gave the movie a 9 and if someone would start a drum roll I will tell you why.Normally, I would have given this movie a perfect ten due to the fact that I never tire of watching it. If I need a laugh, throw Pulp Fiction into the DVD player because it never fails to deliver. However, I had to go way back to 1994 to remember why I have to give it a nine. Pulp Fiction almost lost me when I watched it the first time. I described the movie in 1994 as ""very slow in the beginning, but stick with it and it all pays off"". I use the term ""lost me"" because it best describes the art form that I most love and even perform on a regular basis.I am a stand up comedian. You may be saying so what? Well when you watch this movie from my point of view, then you might appreciate it for what it is(which I will get to in a moment if I don't lose you). Stand-up comedy if not for the faint of heart. Unless you are a well known commodity(Chris Rock, George Carlin), audiences will not give you time of day. If you don't grab their attention in the first thirty seconds, then you have probably lost them for good. It doesn't matter if the rest of your act would make the warden from ""Shawshank Redemption"" roll over in his chair barely able to breathe from laughter, its a lost cause. Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction, the film was about ten seconds from losing me in the first 45 minutes. Now that I have developed an appreciation for the movie, it never comes close to losing me as I am watching a masterpiece unfold. The problem with people who give this movie a 1 is that they take ""filmwatching"" too seriously. Pulp Fiction is not Citizen Kane. Surprise!! Pulp Fiction did not want to be Citizen Kane. Not every movie is made with the intention of making you look deep into your own soul to discover the meaning of life. There is nothing wrong with movies that have a profound positive impact on people. ""Shawshank Redemption"" is my favorite movie of all time and I admit that it always brings a tear to my eye. There is nothing wrong with movies that teach you something about people of a different era or race. I love ""The Color Purple"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"".I would give all three of the above mentioned films a 10(Shawshank, Color Purple, Driving Miss Daisy). I know some of the people who have coined Pulp Fiction with terms like ""i worry about the world I live in when I see people rating this trash a ten"" are probably thinking that I must be bi-polar.However, when you look at these four films as a whole, there are many recurring themes. Rape occurs in most of the above mentioned films and all the films have racial overtones. So if these classics have so much in common, then why such a disparity in the way these films are graded? Pulp Fiction isn't trying to say that rape is cool. Tarantino is simply taking a very dramatic experience and finding a way to derive some humor from it. Often, the best laughs come unexpectedly and for a comedian like me not to see the punchline coming from a mile away is very much appreciated. You must admit that Tarantino has some filming courage. I can only imagine the crew on the set of Pulp Fiction during the car scene. To have blood and human brains splattered across the car while listening to Tarantino asking Samuel Jackson and Travolta to be funny with the dialog must have been hilarious. Only a very skilled filmmaker could make the following quote funny. ""What now? Let me tell you what now. I'ma call a coupla hard, pipe-hittin' n-word, who'll go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. You hear me talking', hillbilly boy? I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'ma get medieval on your ass. Very few people could read that dialogue and make it funny. I'll close with this. . Just loosen up a bit and watch the movie with lowered expectations. Criminals do have everyday conversations. They don't just talk about killing people all day. In fact they probably don't discuss it much at all. Didn't you learn anything from The Godfather or Goodfellas? Its always ""take care of that thing with that short guy from the south"". That is the point that Tarantino is trying to establish in the opening scenes with the whole ""Royal with cheese"" dialogue that people whine about so much. Once you loosen up and realize that this isn't one of those groundbreaking films that teaches us values blah blah blah....then you might see that Pulp Fiction isn't that different than some of your favorites. Most of the classic films tackle issues like rape, racism, and violence. The difference between Pulp Fiction and the other classics is that sensitive issues are dealt with in comedic fashion rather than the standard dramatic flair that most of us are use to. Psychologist always recommend humor to ""break the ice"" prior to dealing with sensitive issues. So think about that before you throw a one out of ten grade to a film that obviously deserves better."
16 December 2019,icemajorr,1,2,10,A masterpiece!,"I am no film geek, I don't know much about films and haven't got that scheme of noticing the values of movies... yet I can say that this masterpiece is a 10/10 material.
Oh man!
I consider the atmosphere in movie as probably the most important thing (although, there are exceptions), if I can't feel the movie I know it's not going to be superb. But with Pulp Fiction I felt ripped off the world we live in and put as an observer in it. I enjoyed every single second of it... and boy was the soundtrack great (Urge Overkill - Girl You'll Be a Woman Soon <3).
Open up Netflix on Saturday night, turn off the lights, lay down comfortably in bed and enjoy!"
16 February 2003,ass_head,0,1,10,The worst review I have ever written,"I have seen this movie many times and I still haven't figured it all out because it is a very complex movie.  I could go on and on about hidden plot meanings that I interpreted, but that would take up too much space so I am just going to write about the bigger things.I think the greatest thing about this movie is that in the end it made me feel like I was watching more than one movie.  This film is almost 3 hours long and I wasn't bored for one minute, and it didn't even feel like 3 hours to me.  I also have to reward Quentin for his writing because he doesn't hide anything from his audience, he places them in the character's shoes and has them follow their every step.This is the worst review of a movie I have ever written because there is not much I can say about this movie.  It is freakin' awesome because it is such a long, enthralling, and enjoyable ride.  Other than empty comments on this movie there is not much more I can say other than it is very entertaining, although it is not for everyone.  Quentin Tarantino's movies are very selective with the audience it draws in so if you don't  like this movie then you might as well give up on this man because his movies will never be normal.  I, for one, love Quentin's films because he is great at writing realistic, funny, and cool dialogue.  So, of course I recommend this movie to everyone because I think it is great and we should support good filmmakers such as Quentin and boost the demand for more ""different"" movies. By the way, the whole non-linear thing works because it is related to the style of the movie:  The past meets the present.  As for the references to the past we have Jules's 70s style afro, the film's older music soundtrack, the Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant, the outdated audio equipment at Mia Wallace's house, and various other things.  As for the present references we have The Wolf's modern style Camero, Jules and Vincent's cell phones, the style of Honey-Bunny and Pumpkin's clothes, the drug dealer's girlfriend and friend's style in the beginning, and various other things.  The film looks like it takes place in the past but we can clearly see that it takes place during the present, so it looks like the characters are caught in a time warp.  Since the film is non-linear then the audience too finds themselves in a time warp.  In that way I think that the storytelling has relevance for those who do not believe so.     P.S. I have read many reviews on this movie about people commenting on the excessive violence and explicit language in the movie, which are not things to be singled out about this movie.  A lot of you know-it-alls out there don't like these kinds of movies because you think that the movie wouldn't sell if the bad language and violence were taken out, which is not true. There are a lot of stupid and unimportant movies out there that a lot of people like because they are traditional and do not make the audience think. Just because a director like Quentin decides to tell a story in a different way does not automatically make it stupid.  Different is not stupid.  This movie needs violence and the like because that is what gangsters do, and the style of the violence makes the movie interesting and unpredictable.  Action movies are the ones that strive for violence because that IS the plot, and there are many of you who would die without your car jumping off a 10 story building and staying in one piece.  I am just sick of people hating movies because they are different because that just means less good movies for me to watch."
14 October 2003,Roly_Savage,0,2,10,Without doubt the best of the best,"Tarrantino is a legend in film making even after only only really making three movies (forget about 4 rooms).  Pulp Fiction is the best of his films, and in many peoples minds the greatest film of all time.  It is one of those films you can watch over and over again and never become bored of.
The script, the cast, the acting, the dialogue, the scenery.  Everything about this movie is outstanding.An extroidinary achievement.BEST ACTOR:  Without doubt SAM JACKSON.  His Ezikiel rant will go donw as the best monlologue in the history of cinema. BEST ACTRESS: Um...UMA THURMAN.  Not a hard one that. BEST SCENE: In Jimmys house.  Although Tarantino can't act, this was a great piece of comedy. BEST QUOTE: ""And i will strike down uopn thee with great vengence and furious anger...""OVERALL: 10/10"
5 November 2003,The_Wicker_Man,0,3,10,Simply the greatest film ever...,"This movie has it all.  The plot it twistingly brilliant and yet when you break it down so simple (kinda like Midsummer Night's Dream in one respect). The performances are gritty (Ving Rhames, Bruce Wilis), entertaining (Uma thurman, Eric Stoltz, Harvey Kietel) and in sme cases career defining (John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson).The whole movie is shot fantastically well, in occassional scenes (Vincent Vega & Mrs Wallacel; The Taxi Cab) almost too well so that you are captivated enough by the visual effects that the plotlines are occassionally overlooked!  The most remarkable thing about this movie is how familiar it feels.  You're sitting wathing it and its comfortable and this only adds to the enjoyment.  The only possible drawback to this epic is its length but for me this adds enjoyment as by the time its ended you want to watch it all overagain so you can truly appreciate how clever it is!The musical score is fantastic, as it is with all of Tarentino's films and is almost enough entertainment tht you can ignore the film - but i wouldnt recommend that to anyone.  This is truly a modern day classic, with so many talking points that'll keep the buffs amongst you at it for hours..."
30 November 2003,Memento_10,0,2,10,Truly Gods Work!,Before I saw Pulp Fiction I hadn't seen any of Quentin Tarintino's movies. Hearing that it would be like a comic book having all the stories mixed up made me think this would be just another person trying to be artistic. But when I saw this movie WOW! After watching it I watched it two more times in the same day. Yes that's how good it is. You need to see it more than once if you don't understand parts of it because everything does has a meaning in this movie. It's my second favorite movie so plz see this movie it is truly gods work!
28 January 2004,moonwio,0,2,10,"Seen many films, this is the best.","I have to say that Pulp Fiction is the best film I've ever seen. Quentin Tarantino's greatest talent as a filmmaker is his ability to pull career-best performances out of actors, particularly his first two films(this and Reservoir Dogs).Samuel L. Jackson is as good as advertised. His bible quote has gone down in history next to Robert Duvall's napalm speech in Apocalypse Now and Marlon Brando's contender speech in On the Waterfront as one of the most memorable monologues in film history. Travolta, Willis, and Thurman were all also good, but the film's other great performance comes from Harvey Keitel. The Wolf is so cool that even Jules is left in awe.Tarantino and Roger Avary's script is composed of elements of other famous films yet remains original in its conception. The dialogue is profane, but hilarious and sometimes even profound. Even with this excellent script, the acting is what makes this film great.Other great movies include Scarface, the first two Godfathers, the original Star Wars movies(but not the new ones), The Usual Suspects, Taxi Driver, and the aforementioned Apocalypse Now and Reservoir Dogs."
31 March 2004,chasingdogma54,0,2,10,best movie ever,"this is my favorite movie of all time. the way that quentin tarantino weeves together all these original and interesting stories is extradinary. he also comes up with the best and most original characters ever put on the big screen. the comedy is hilarious also.  one more thing worth noting is the dialogue that QT writes. from describing cheeseburgers to uncomfortable silences, some of the most entertaining and most intelligent dialogue can be found in this movie. My favorite part is the bonnie situation. its so great and so memorbable. the way harvey keitel plays the part is unbelievable. the acting, plot, and overall movie is unexplainably great. if you havent seen it, then go rent it before you miss out on the best movie ever seen by human eyes. i wish this movie had won more awards. god knows it deserved all of 'em"

                        ",What is this movie about?,"Well I personally think this movie is about the simplicity of violence and the ever-lasting circle of it. There's really not much to say about this movie, except the fact that it's awesome, or is there...? Superb casting and nice, good direction from Tarantino is a real pleasure to watch. John Travolta's and Samuel L. Jackson's characters, hit men Vince and Jules, are funny yes, but they also make you think. The speech of Jules in the end of the movie is in my opinion at least a speech against violence. ""And I am the tyranny of evil men"" he says a gun in his hand pointing it at ""the weak"".The real pleasure of Pulp Fiction is that you are watching a movie that really comes. A movie that is in no way extraordinary really, but is left in your mind basically through the time you stay alive. And of course it set the course of good crime movies. Tarantino's screenplay also is amazing. It's nice to see characters talking as they really would once..."

Offbeat, witty, and loaded with a memorable, character- driven narrative, it's clearly his greatest work.Pros: witty dialogue; memorable quotes, especially from Jules; a lot of food talk; deep, lively characters; a fair bit of dark comedyCons: lots of violence, especially of the gunfire typeIn-betweens: non-linear storytelling; lots of cursing; blurring lines of morality; Tarantino himself showing up to remind the audience that in the end, it's just a movieBottom Line: Whatever gives this film such staying power to this day? I'm sure you could figure it out just by watching the movie yourself."
30 June 2019,StaffayKayser,1,2,10,One of the greatest movies of all time,"This movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino, and it might be - or IS the best movie that made him famous in the 1990's. The plot is fresh still today, and is far from cliche's and tools of the trade like car crashes and nonsense dialogs. Violence plays a big part, as in many of Tarantinos films, but its never out-of-place or there for its own right. On the contrary, this is no movie for children or people that takes offence in violent scenes.The main characters in the movie are played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman, the former two are hitmen and Thurman plays the wife of a mafia boss. It also marks the come-back of Travolta, who's reputation as a disco star from ""Grease"" and ""Saturday Night Fever"" prevented him from getting major roles until ""Pulp Fiction"". Here he really shows off what a good actor he is, and the dance scene with Uma Thurman is just pure magic.I rarely see movies more than once - in fact it's less than ten movies that has been that good. I use to watch this movie every five year or so, and still it leaves me breathless. It's really the beginning of a new era in the art of film making, and both the camera, soundtrack and directing is absolutely magnificent. By purpose I didn't point out any details, since You must really explore them by Yourself in the right context. Be prepared to watch a shocking story with a nerve rarely seen!"
3 January 2006,sillyputty235,0,1,10,Absolutely Genius!!,"If I were to make a Top 20 list of movies to keep, Pulp Fiction would be up in the top 3. This movie was absolutely terrific. This was the 2nd Tarantino movie I had seen (the first was Kill Bill, also terrific) and it officially turned me onto his movies forever. This movie has many strong points, but the unique part of this movie is that its success does not rest on its plot. Put frankly, the plot is not even that interesting, not much happens. However, what makes this film superior is that Tarantino did this intentionally, and the real excellence of this film lies in the brilliant cast, dialogue, acting, and non-chronological portrayal of the story as a whole. I would easily give this film a 10 out of 10, and if you have seen this film and are looking for others like it, I would recommend Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Jackie Brown, True Romance, Snatch, Sin City, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."
14 February 2001,cb05677,1,2,10,fantastic,"This is the most fantastic movie with the perfect lines so far ever been made. Time for Tarantino to show he can ever do better (is that ever possible??????) Also watch 'from dusk till dawn' and 'reservoir dogs' Different, but also magnificent."

                        ","bloodiest, seediest, sweariest film of 1994.","Pulp fiction is one of the most influential films of 1990s.It is directed by Quentin Tarantino,the finest in the industry. Pulp Fiction connects the intersecting story lines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase.Tarantino's twist on the pulp genre is also damn near a work of art. His passion is for storytelling that allows the most outrageous characters to reveal their feelings in long takes and torrents of words, poetic and profane.One suggestion,don't just watch the movie,listen to it to see the beauty of it.Pulp Fiction was always a film that asked more questions that it answered. Until now.Every one of us is different with our different values,cultures and choices and at times we tend to watch a movie which we like and which can suit us.For instance,you may love romcoms but not a crime drama like pulp fiction.So ever felt that you want to know the list of best romcoms in different years.Then www.flickstree.com is the best platform for you.Now stop searching for the movies in different sites and blogs.Simply log in to find out interesting movies to watch!Highly recommended!"

The performances by John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis were superb; Samuel L Jackson's portrayal of Jules Winnifield was especially spectacular. The film produces an absolutely unique twist of dark comedy and violence,topped off with great pop culture references.Perhaps greatest of all,is the phenomenal dialogue; the witty dialogue and subtext will never be able to replicated in any other film.
This is Tarantinos masterpiece , a magnificent work of cinematic art that deserves to be heralded as one of the most iconic films of modern cinema. Pulp Fiction revolutionised cinema making for years to come, and rightly cements Quentin Tarantino's status as an exceptional director."

I totally expected all the negative comments I saw; this film isn't for everyone.  But it's a lot of fun to watch, and this is because of Tarrentiono's cool ideas.

                        ",Pure Genuis,"Everyone blames Quentin Tarantino for having too much violence in his movies. People say Pulp Fiction has the most violence.  I can't disagree more.  Pulp Fiction has very little violence and people should look at the movie as a brilliant piece of art and not as a violent movie.  Tarantino did an outstanding job at bringing a not that complex story and everyday dialogue to the screen in one of the most enjoyable films ever.  On top of the brilliant story and writing, there are the performances.  To start, Samuel L. Jackson gives the best performance I have ever seen on screen as Jules The Hitman.  His performance is memorible and some of the things he says and does is unforgettable.  Harvey Keitel is just as impressive as The Wolf.  The scene with Keitel, Jackson, Travolita and Tarantino in Jimmy's house is classic.  Pulp Fiction ranks among the best movies ever made and for good reason cause it is an absolute great movie and should be cherished for years to come and I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this movie.  The dialogue is great and the way Tarantino split a basic story into 3 different parts is amazing.  **** out of 4 stars for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction"

                        ",one of the most important films of all time,"I just recently finished watching pulp fiction for what seems like the millionth time and I thought that I'd share some of my thoughts and feelings about this timeless piece of film. This is my favorite film of all time. It ranks right up on my top ten. Every time i sit down and watch this movie, I lose track of time and I'm sucked into this fictional world. There are a million things that I love about this film. First there's the story structure. Tarantino loves to turn his movies upside down and inside out. He follows a non linear story telling structure. Some people dont like this form of storytelling. For me I think it's a good idea that I usually dont see that often in movies. The dialogue in pulp gets fresher and fresher after each viewing. The reason why i think it does this is because most movies i see have the same type of dialogue. So when i see a movie like this it still seems new to me. A conversation about fast food before the hitmen go to kill off some guys usually doesnt occur in movies. Tarantino knew this when he wrote it and is very original. Another thing I love is the camera. It seems like it is a character in and of itself. I also like the actors in this film. I just wish i could step into their shoes and experience the world through their eyes. My favorite of all of them is Sam ""the man"" Jackson. His character is very well developed. The dialogue that he is given becomes somewhat of an entity. Upon many viewings I caught different things I had not noticed from before. One example of this is in the opening sequence. When I saw it for the first time on dvd I caught john travoltas charcter walking to the bathroom while pumpkin and honey bunny are talking. That and many other scenes just get better and better each time i see it. By the end of the year I'll probably have had watched it for the trillionth time. When I have kids of my own I will show them this masterpiece. And by the time im old decrepped and in a retirement home I will have seen it to an eternity. Pulp Fiction is by far one of my favorite films and it should be seen by anyone who likes film."

                        ","Same, yet different.","Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies ever made. Why? It's because it's different from these other straight storyboard movies. You know, those types that you know the conflict 30 minutes into the movie and it's all problems in solving the conflict (Just take a look at Armageddon. It was good, but the solution to the problem was simple, but totally avoidable problems is what made the movie 3 hours long.)It's like Terrantino made the movie, chopped it up, then just tossed the scenes down in no particular order. You HAD to watch this movie twice to get the full effect. ALL the actors were good with their roles (Including the one who was ripped. You know who I'm talking about!) and the overall layout was next to perfect. A must see movie!!"
1 August 1999,mrironle,0,0,10,Best flick of the decade,"This is the best. The dialog between actors was great. Absence of a single staring role was very appreciated, all the character parts were diversify unique and all were developed appropriately. Every seen had an unexpected twist, yet never leaving you confused or trying to lead the audience astray.  I was completely absorbed never finding a dull moment, or having time to try and figure out what was coming next. This is unequivocally the best movie of the decade. I saw it twice."

                        ",A good but really weird movie,"When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I said to my self, ""This is the most stupid movie I had ever seen."" But then after watching it four or five times, it was actually pretty good. I bought it because it was said to be one of the best films ever made, and it had great actors in it like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken. But when I watched it was very disappointed. I thought it was really stupid, and there was no plot to it. But then I watched it a couple more times, and I could see why a lot of people liked it. The main plot to it is the story of two hit-men (Travolta and Jackson). In the movie there are four different stories about these hit-men and there amazing adventures. This movie won the an Academy Award for The Best Oringinal Screenplay. So if you want to see a fairly entertaining movie watch Pulp Fiction. If you would like to see a better film by Quentin Tarantino (Director of Pulp Fiction), see Jackie Brown. I would say it is much more entertaining."
13 July 1999,JediLazy,0,0,9,Great Movie by Quentin Tarantino,"I can tell you right now not everyone will like this movie. Especially critics, but I personally thought it was brilliant directing.  It was a great idea to put the movie in different order.  This then makes you pay more attention than most movies. Also what I loved and always love about Quentin Tarantino movies is the dialog.  The way a character talks helps me understand the character more which makes the movie easier to understand. Last but not least, its the little things that get me to like a movie. Like the code for the briefcase which is 666, and the bandaid on the back of Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames) neck. Now how did that happen.  Overall I gave this movie an 8.  I always thought Quentin Tarantino would make great movies."

He finally said to ""Little Pumpkin"" that you are the weak and I am an evil person, but I am trying very hard to make myself a shepherd to protect you from the threat of this evil world. Because Jules is not going to kill the ""little pumpkin"", such a shot appears to be less nervous and stimulating.

This is a true great and a pioneering movie in the way it was directed and put together. I love the way that tarrentino has chopped the stories into smaller pieces that all inter-link with one another and its not till the very end that you think back and understand how the individual sections interlinked. The characters were great and very well acted out, the story line kept you interested right till the end and the film was pure brilliance!

30 January 2010,reesu_daddy,0,4,8,Most overrated movie of All Time.,"OK, yes, this movie is pretty much entertaining. The acting of Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis in the movie was good to enjoy. If anyone sees this movie for any entertainment purpose, he/she will not be disappointed.But I just don't get the idea that why this movie is IMDb No.5 of top 250 in the list??? If you see the first 4 of the IMDb top 250 and then come to see this movie, then you are truly going to be disappointed. People are calling it a ""masterpiece"", ""one of the best of all time"", ""best movie I had ever seen"", etc, and I am truly surprised with those reviews !!!!! I haven't found anything to call it a great movie, or a masterpiece. The movie is good, but very much overrated by the common people. The story is fine, cinematography is fine, acting is fine, but nothing great. I am very much disappointed by the opinion of so many people who call it a masterpiece or great movie.If anyone who haven't seen this movie yet and planning to watch it in near future, do not sit to watch with great expectations."

27 May 2011,KolbeinnMoon,0,1,10,Epic Masterpiece,"Quentin Tarantino is no doubt one of the greatest directors of all time.His second feature,Pulp Fiction,won an Oscar for best screenplay and gave the entire cast a career boost in the progress.Let's begin the technical aspects.The cinematography is excellent,the sound effects are very realistic and the music is just about perfect.The lightning is very pleasant to watch.Now let's turn to the scripted aspects.The dialogue is unforgettable,the storyline is excellent(some would say mindblowing).Almost everything I love about the movies can be found in Pulp Fiction.Pulp Fiction is an unpredictable funny surprise.The actors are all excellent.The best thing about Pulp Fiction(although some say it is the worst)is that it references almost every single film made.If you do not see Pulp Fiction,well then you should be ashamed of yourself.There are few things some complain about however when they see the movie: -Too much dialogue(I say too little) -Too much violence(Phantom Menace has a higher death rate) -Complicated Storyline(storyline is NOT complicated,it is just unique) -Unoriginality(Arrival of train is the only original film ever made,all other films are just ripoffs) Very basement scene(I agree) A lot of swearing(Does not bother me much)SEE THIS MOVIE!I DARE YOU,I DOUBLE DARE YOU MOTHERFU$$ER,SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! what?

26 June 2013,sephev,0,0,10,Two hours and thirty-four minutes of pure enjoyment,"Until recently, I was one of the few people on earth who had not seen this film. However, a couple of days ago, I finally ordered the Tarantino box-set and sat down to watch Pulp Fiction. The phrase ""blown away"" is thrown around a lot regarding a variety of things, but I can honestly say that I am not exaggerating in the slightest. There are so many fantastic things about this film, but I think one of the film's best assets is Tarantino's magnificently woven screenplay. Halfway through the film, I was wondering how Tarantino could possibly link all of the stories together to make some sort of sense, and then he managed to spectacularly. The characters and moments he has created in this film will be remembered for years to come. He simply breathes life into all of his characters, giving them their own personalities and showing a three dimensional side to every single person in the film, even the more minor characters like Zed and Fabienne. Vincent's slightly dorky, disorganised gangster was brilliant to watch, especially when he is looking after Mia; Keitel's ""Wolf"" was seedy and yet classy at the same time; Butch's sentimental motives were humorous given that he had just killed a man for his own selfish gain; Christopher Walken's short scene as Captain Kooks made me laugh out loud. Even character like The Gimp were interesting enough to leave you thinking about them for time afterwards. Credit must, of course, be given to the performances of every single actor and actress in the film. There was not a single performance that was slightly out of place or off key to the world around them. Every line was delivered with perfect timing, and it made Tarantino's already great screenplay even better. My personal favourite was Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Jules, although I don't think that's a very original choice on my part. The cinematography in this film is equally memorable, too. There was not a single shot, just like the performances of the actors & actresses, that was out of place or drew away from the experience of the film. The long, uninterrupted shot of Jules and Vincent walking along the corridor talking about Mia's foot massage before the infamous burger sequence was one of my favourites. To top it all off, the soundtrack is pure genius – I can't help but feel like a bad-ass whenever I hear Misirlou by Dick Dale or Surf Rider by The Lively Ones after watching this film. Handpicked by Tarantino himself, I hear. An interesting point about this film is the fact that it has no clear moral story or message. This, I think, is one of the reasons that I, and many people, enjoyed it so much, because it is not trying to be something that it is not. It is pure enjoyment, and the text at the very beginning makes it clear that the phrase ""Pulp Fiction"" means, essentially, ""Trash Story"". The mystery surrounding the briefcase is most likely Tarantino's way of letting the viewer decide what is in the case themselves, making for some very interesting speculation. Despite being very funny and very enjoyable, Pulp Fiction still has its dark, less enjoyable moments, one of the most memorable involving Marsellus, Zed and a basement (need I say any more?). However, Tarantino still manages to make these dark moments funny and enjoyable, and certainly manages to make them memorable. For a very controversial film about the criminal underworld in Los Angeles, this film is surprisingly timeless. I can genuinely imagine people still watching it for many, many years to come, and for them to enjoy it as much as the original audiences did, and as much as I did. Pulp Fiction is fully deserving of all the awards and popularity surrounding it, and manages to make the same impact on new audiences nowadays as it did to the original audiences nearly 20 years ago. Quentin Tarantino has truly made something special – a classic, you might say. It will go down in my opinion, and many others I am sure, of one of the best films of all time. One of the only flaws about it is that I doubt whether Tarantino will ever be able to top it..."
31 December 2003,aatif_nawaz,0,1,10,Incredible!!!,"WoW!!!Its hard to talk about a movie like pulp fiction. What am I suppossed to comment on. The strength of the performances? The originality of the plot? The manner in which is engages its audience?Well though the movie would get glowing reviews based on the aforementioned criteria, it still wouldn;t do a movie like this justice.Simply put, you just have to watch it. When you do, you'll know what I mean."
5 April 2004,rmphw9,0,2,8,Not a bad flick...,"I was intitially a little apprehensive at viewing this film.  The reason being that I had previously viewed a Quentin Tarantino film, From Dusk Till Dawn, and was very disappointed.  However, this film was very good.  The writing was almost perfect (Tarantino deservedly received an Oscar for his screenplay).  His direction was also very good and aided in the story line. However, I think the greatest asset to this film was Samuel L. Jackson's performance as a religious gangster  Not only does he perfectly portray the stereotypical angry black gangster but he infuses dark comic undertones unseemlingly.  John Travolta also gives a great performance as Jackson's moronic sidekick.  With other good performances by Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames, this movie is definately a must see."
3 July 2013,Theodor-turner,0,9,4,Not deserving of the IMDb top 250,"Pulp Fiction is, overall, a poorly written and poorly directed movie. What shines though is the acting, which carries the entire film.The plot is confused and riddled with continuity errors. Events do not occur in chronological order, but in 'chapters,' and the story is too far-fetched and too violent for the experience to be enjoyable. With the exception of Joules (Samuel L Jackson), every character is completely one-dimensional. Coupled with the fact that there is zero character development, this film gets very repetitive. Pulp Fiction starts off abysmally, an levels to at best mediocre by the end.The good in the movie is Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis in their roles (though Tarantino's cameo appearance is laughable as always). Luckily, unlike all other Tarantino movies, no one suddenly does something completely out of character. This allows the film to just about carry itself, but it certainly does not justify the 9 and 10-star reviews Pulp Fiction has received. As usual, Tarantino's 'visionary' work is nothing more than a crass, overly violent flop."
1 July 2005,ClaudeSpeed1-1,0,1,10,Absolutely Brilliant Film,"Pulp Fiction is one of those films that sticks in your mind even months after you've seen it. It is also a film that you can watch more than once. Tarantino fills this will brilliant dialogue, witty pop culture references, action, drama, suspense, and a little bit of love. The cinematography is beautiful and artistic in a sense, and the the unconventional non-linear way he filmed this is absolutely outstanding. This film makes some stars shine without a doubt, especially in Travolta, Jackson, Willis, Rhames, and Thurman. I won't spoil anything for you, but if you are a fan of excellent movies then this is your bag. I give it a 10 out of 10 for its sheer brilliance."
31 July 2015,rithiksharma,0,1,10,best black comedy ever made,"My oh my. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie. It is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5."
12 February 2005,ssjknux,1,3,9,Simply Amazing,"I absolutely loved this movie. Quentin Tarantino's direction is amazing, as is his writing. Roger Avary deserves his writing props as well. John Travolta shows his talent in this film, proves once again that he is not just a savvy sorta heartthrob guy but also a talented actor. Vincet Vega remains one of my favorite theatrical characters of all time. Samuel L. Jackson is the actor who shines the most, spouting Bible verses and having revelations. Bruce Willis is also another who goes against what he has been categorized as (a brainless guy with a nice body) to what we all love him as in this movie (a witty guy with a nice body). Uma Thurman is not the prettiest in this movie, but her acting is great and she delivers the lines so well you can't tell she didn't write the movie. I love the plot and everything. Watch this if you haven't."
5 March 2022,Eleatic67,0,2,8,More Porn,Tarantino is not a serious filmmaker. His sole interest is in sex and violence that will shock and hypnotize the audience. There are no real human beings in his films dealing with actual life experiences. His main objective is to make a dollar and promote his giant ego. I am quite certain that he cares little about the world in which he lives or the challenges that people face. David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson are far more interesting.

From the soundtrack, to the actors that star in the movie to the plot and to everything else that brings the film together; makes it all great. Incomparable to any other movie simply because this movie got every single scene perfectly and was one of the only movies where the actors completely mastered their roles and brang out their character as much as possible. Which is why i think it was able to stand out as much as it did because literally everything in the movie stood out."

If you want to read a review to make a decision wheather to watch the movie of not, please do not read any further, just go watch the movie. It will be totally worth your time. You may end up watching it more than once. And then come back and read the following.No one has seen movies like Reservoir Dogs before Quentin Tarantino became a director. Just like no one saw any E.T.s before Steven Spielberg became a film maker. Yes, Quentin Tarantino has got class when making movies. Pulp fiction is a great movie, a movie every film and media professor would recommend his or her students to watch and write a review for. But have you ever felt this movie has clichés? When we see Pulp fiction, we feel impressed that QT has cast a black man as the mob ""big"" boss. We feel impressed when white people are shown as his henchmen which we never get to see in many Hollywood movies. But think... wasn't the mob ""big"" boss black because he had to get raped. Penetrated from the rear by a white man. Would the movie's reviews or QT's reputation have changed if it was the other way round. A white mob boss being raped by a black cop? Isn't Tarantino submitting to what the majority audience want to see than maybe presenting his own point of view? Or does he really feel what he showed?"
29 May 2020,yobreezy-45179,0,0,10,And the oscar went to a movie based on a book.,"Pulp fiction was the example of biggest oscar snub in history. They undermined the perfection of originality over an adaptation. Not that Forrest Gump was a bad movie, I recommend that too but this was the true deserving movie. But not be concerned, oscars don't define a movie. 1994 was a tough call. This is the pure art of originality. It won't give you any message except of that bible verse which is the single most badass line ever spoken on a movie. This is a true classic that will be talked about for decades of cinematic years.

8 October 2013,wjez,1,3,10,A Classic Masterpiece,"This is the film that redefined movies in general. With a great script, actors and actresses that really gives their best performance, and a masterful director to finish, Pulp Fiction is a classic masterpiece that I dare say beats any other movie masterpieces the world known. Pulp Fiction is a crime movie that is in love with dialogue. And the dialogue ranges from a simple random chat to an argument about miracles. Quentin Tarantino seems to just put in everything he can think of while writing this script, and I have to say, it worked. You will find yourself repeating the lines that are said in this movie long after the end credits rolled. Although this isn't a comedy movie, Pulp Fiction always delivers scenes after scenes that are absurd, ridiculous, and at times roaringly hilarious. A scene in the car near the end of the movie had me rolling on the floor because it was so damned funny. There are some other scenes that had me rolling on the floor too but I'll let you watch the movie yourself to see which ones are they. Yes, this is one of those movies that you can just watch over and over again and never get bored of watching. Loads of reasons why, not to mention the great script, great acting, great music, and the fantastic effort from the now well-known Quentin Tarantino. I must've watched it over a 100 times and I have never been bored of watching it. So, why don't you go do yourself a favour and go watch this movie if you haven't already. And believe me, you will want to watch it again. More than twice."

3 June 1999,devonreed,0,0,10,The most important film of our generation,"I was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the Pulp debate.  Someone stated that they had just seen the movie (in 1999, five years after its release) and could not understand the hype. Well, therein lies the greatest problem facing a film like Pulp Fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years ago has been utterly ransacked by the Hollywood mainstream.  Anyone who saw a film like Bonnie & Clyde 30 years ago will say what an impact the film made on them, when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film.  Pulp Fiction already seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film.  Sure some of what Tarantino did had been done before.  We'd seen rampant drug use in Drugstore Cowboy, and gangster black comedy in Goodfellas, but Tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties, and thusly created the film, and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. Pulp Fiction trampled the Hollywood blockbuster industry (remember this was the year of Forrest Gump) and sent studios running to Sundance to find the next big thing.  People who look at Pulp Fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have after listening to, say, Nirvana's Nevermind:  ""It's good, but I don't get the fuss.""  Of course you don't.  You have to be there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on EVERYTHING we see and hear today.  People who call Pulp Fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films.  Pulp Fiction is not the greatest film ever made.  It is however, the most important film of our generation."
9 February 2021,s-01528,1,2,10,One of the greatest stories told through a movie,"Quentin Tarantino is a cinema genius. He knows how to make a movie engaging, and ""Pulp Fiction"" is such an engaging watch. The dialogue is witty and charming. It makes you come to love everyone of the characters. This is a solid cast with some of the most quotable and iconic scenes in cinema history. However, one of the most engaging things about ""Pulp Fiction"" is its story. The way this movie delivers its story was ground breaking for the time. The story is told out of order with different parts of the story focusing on different characters. It is up to audience to piece together how the different stories connect. The film is always delivering subtle details. This also works in conjunction with the cast. They all deliver very expressive yet subtle performances that really give the audience a view into what each character is thinking. This movie is also packed to the brim with adult humor which just works. The question of the day though is what is the point of this movie and I say to that, there is not point. Everyone will get something different from this movie, and what the audience gets from this movie will vary from person to person. However, there is no denying that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is the Vanilla of Tarantino and a must watch for anyone who likes movies and stories in general."
19 March 2005,Kit_Carruthers,1,3,10,QT's best and most creative.,"Pulp Fiction when viewed for what it is, is a great movie. But the man at the helm is not a great director. His ability to take every movie he's ever seen and amalgamate them into his own is magnificent. But ask yourself: Where is the real creativity? What has Quentin Tarantino contributed to cinema? Anyway, back to the movie: What makes Pulp Fiction (and Reservoir Dogs) such a great movie is a) the dialogue and b) the music and c) how it's all presented to us. Listening to someone talk about why they don't like bacon should not be interesting, but it is. This is QT's talent, the ability to make the mundane - cool. The movie references are refreshing to film buffs and the music is superb: another of QT's talents - knowing what song to play and when. Overall, Pulp Fiction IS a classic, I just don't like the director as a man."

                        ","Although it had some competition, ""Pulp Fiction"" is my choice for best film of the 90's!","Although it had some competition ""Pulp Fiction"" is my choice for best film of the 90's! ""Forrest Gump"", ""GoodFellas"", and ""Fargo"", all came close, but none measure up to this Tarantino classic. Everything in this movie is as good as it gets. The screenplay is amazing, winning ""Pulp"" it's ONLY acadamy award of 1994. Most all of the awards it should have won were stolen away by one of my earlier mentioned, honorable mentions for best 90's film ""Forrest Gump"" which truly is a classic, but isn't on the level of ""Pulp"". Overall, the script is marvoulsly written and put together by Tarantino and Avary.The acting spawned numerous acadamy award nominations, but suprisingly didn't win any. Samuel L. Jackson definetly gives a worthy performance as the bible quoting, ""N"" word saying hit man Jules that changes his thoughts about his career after what he calls a divine intervention. John Travalto proves he truly is the comeback kid  also earning a nomination for his Elvis-Man,Vicent, type hitman who gets blown away in the bathroom, but still appears in the end of the film, because of how the script is written. (For some reason Tarantino makes all of his characters in all of his movies wind up in the bathroom to create interesting situations. Roth and Bushemi in ""Dogs"". Jackson, Thurman, and Travolta in ""Pulp"", and, well, I don't remember one in ""Jackie Brown"". Oh Well, No Matter.) Bruce Willis is particularly fun and powerful as Butch in the seen where he stumbles into the wrong store at the wrong time. Along side him is Ving Rhames in an equally powerful performance as Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman plays Mia, Mea, however you spell it, the wife of Marcellas, who, when unable to handle a hit,is ran around all over every where, leading up to a highly intense adrenaline shot seen. Christopher Walken makes a funny cameo, Harvey Kietel does, too. Even Tarantino himself makes a cameo as Jimmy. All in all, all the suprising twists and turns, and breathtaking action/violence make ""Pulp Fiction an instant classic!"

                        ",One of the VERY best,"This film is violent and i can see how people can find it shocking, or whatever... But, I've been raised on TV/film violence (I'm 19) and don't care much.So, anyway, this film is one of the best films I have seen, easily. Firstly, Tarantino wrote and directed.  You can see that he has talent in abundance! Second, the cast is great.  Even though these people are not the sort you are likely to favour in the real-world, there is only one character (Butch's wife) that i don't like. John Travolta shows that he is a good actor (contrary to some of the s**t he's done, and is literally ideal as Vincent.  Samuel L. Jackson is particularly cool, the afro's a dream too! Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitell also stand out as the best of a very fine bunch. Christopher Walken is amazing.  You only see him tell a five minute story, but in that time he earns himself 10 oscars worth! I can go on forever about the characters and cast, but i won't. The dialogue is the most entertaining i've ever heard in a film, a sheer pleaure to the ears.  But the quality of the people will complement the words big-time. The soundtrack is also, yes, you guessed it... very, very good.  It makes me like songs I would most probably never listen to.  Jungle Boogie's my favourite. The other MAJOR asset of this movie is the non-linear story telling.  Ontop of everything else, it makes this movie stand out as quite possibly the best movie of the 90s. It is everything about this film makes it so incredibly good, not to mention strikingly individual.  The cast is a stellar gathering, the story is seriously entertaining, not to mention highly funny throughout the bulk. And the way in which it is told is intelligently captivating, the soundtrack is also a BIG bonus, complementing what you see magnificently. If a fairly seasoned film-watcher of my age does not like this film, he (or she) must have a more innocent, less demented mind than I!  But I like films such as this, my other favourite is a real oddball- Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I can't sing it's praises enough."

But don't worry, even if it's told in a special way it isn't avant-garde to the point where it's impossible to understand it.I just hope that Tarantino can come up with the magic again. I was disappointed with Jackie Brown, I cannot blame him. Not every movie could be masterpiece."

Quentin Tarantino has outdone all previous efforts with his exceptioal tale of two hitmen, a boxer, a suitcase, and the wife of a mob leader. All in all, a terrific film that everyone should OWN, and watch multiple times. I tell ya, there is so much to miss on the first viewing, multiple viewings are mandatory!"

                        ",The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction is a story of three intertwining crime stories told in a non-linear plotline.  Tarantino weaves his stories together in a brilliant fashion.  The film has sometimes been criticized for being to violent even though most of the violence is done offscreen, with elements of humour. It is a twisted entertaining thrill ride that will keep you (sorry for the cliche) on the edge of your seat for the entire 2 1/2 hours.  There's never a dull moment.  The dialogue is witty and clever, the humor is twisted and it is the best film I have ever seen.  Trantino is a natural born filmmaker with vast knowledge of pop culture an will be remebered as one of the great storytellers of our time, and Pulp Fiction will be remebered as one of the greatest films ever made."

                        ",worst movie of Quentin Tarantino,"I think that Quentin Tarantino is one the best directors in hollywood. But he let me down with this movie. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre after 10 minutes. Than so many people said that it was great movie, I went again and saw the whole movie. And I still think it's bad movie.In thru out the movie Travolta ,the most overrated actor alive, is sweating ten litres of sweat an hour and that for a ""cool"" guy. John's acting can't even be compensated by the always great Mr. Jackson and Uma Thurman. When Travolta is saying the f-word, it has the same impact as when your grandmother of 89 years old is saying the f-word. Iam not a fan of Bruce Willis, but in this movie he is really good. The camera action is, as always with Tarantino, excellent.But with the script Iam really disappointed. It lacks that extra thing that Taratino can give. The script feels like it consists of leftover stories, and I don't mean the three main stories(Travolta&Jackson, Willis and Roth$Plummer). Making the story a house of cards."

The story revolves around a number of different characters,including Vincent(John Travolta),Jules(Samuel L Jackson),Butch(Bruce Willis)and Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhymes).The whole cast is in top form,giving some of the best performances of their careers in my opinion. This film is crammed with some of the best dialogue i've ever heard,In no other film will you hear ""bring out the gimp"".Hurrrayyyy,Life is good."

Samuel L Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Stolz, Willis, Walken, Roth and Tarantino all fighting for top place, and they all win in their own roles. I hate the Oscars for giving the Best Picture to Forest Gump- typical oscar bullsh*t. Pulp Fiction is, in a word, Brilliant. In fact, i'm going to go and watch it again."

                        ",My favorite of the 90's,"You've heard them before. The conversational bits in Quentin Tarantino's epic ""Pulp Fiction"" are among the best ever filmed and have not only filled up movie quote books, but have become a part of pop culture. The genius writer/director behind the indie hit ""Reservoir Dogs"" decided to present the film out of chronological order, and the result is the audience actually <i> concentrating <i>, and attempting to understand the order in which the events are placed. The performances are really great as well (remember, most of the movie is dialogue-driven, so the actors really had a chance to show off with these awesome lines).Now you may be wondering why I consider this the best film of the 90's. Here's why. ""Pulp Fiction"" was innovative, intelligent, and inspired a whole new generation of films (as bad as some of them were): the ""cool"" movie. Loads and loads of movies attempted to copycat ""Pulp Fiction""'s very unique style and perfectly written dialogue, yet none of them did. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of a kind.Yes, the movie deserves it's ""R"" rating, but if you're watching it to find something to complain about, then don't watch it at all. ""Pulp Fiction"" is for an audience that doesn't mind to be challenged. If you absolutely can't stand REALLY bad content, then don't watch it. For the rest of us, this is the coolest movie ever.

In no way do I incourage it, but hey, it's a movie, and in a movie, you can do whatever you like.  Anyone who thinks that this is too violent or they swear too much or it's just a piece of filth have obviously overlooked the purpose of film.  Fair enough if you thought that this wasn't entertaining, but don't give lousy excuses such as 'is was too violent' as to why you didn't like it.I found Pulp Fiction thoroughly enjoyable.  OK, so I, to this day have no clue what it was about, but that doesn't bother me because of the unbelievably sharp dialogue.  Frankly, I don't care what this was about, or what type of in depth insight people have on this film, because I see this as something to be watched and laughed at, and for the dialogue to be recited at moments when you're alone...perhaps that's just me then."

                        ",A look into the mind of gangsters,"When I first heard the beginning conversation of this movie, I knew this movie would have truth to it. Now, I'm not a gangster, but I'm pretty sure that killers don't just talk about killing and crime. They probably have normal conversations, like they do in the other amazing Quinten Tarantino movie, Reservoir Dogs. Unlike movies like The Godfather, they make mobsters look like all they know is ""the family"", and all they can talk about is ""the family"".But what also came through in this movie is Samuel L. Jackson's role when speaks about a Eziekel 25 verse 17. Cold blooded killers are not so cold blooded. People might not think that these kind of people read the bible. Characters in movies like Joe Peschi in ""Casino"" distort the ideas people get about gangsters. Even if the line Jackson recites in a violent one, he would have to read the bible to discover it."
9 October 2021,Im_Stuff,0,4,6,"An entertaining movie, although far from being great","For once, a spoiler free review, because I'll be real with you, I don't understand much about this movie. Blame that on my zoomer brain struggling to comprehend this piece. Or maybe my general distaste of entertainment for the sake of it.What I like about any medium is a well crafted story with a proper set up that brings it to its logical conclusion, or blows everyone's mind with a nasty climax. Pulp Fiction is neither. As I stated, it's entertainment for the sake of it. This movie is about several fates who happen to cross on a specific day. It's something that could have happened to everyone. The reason it's even a positive experience rather than something utterly boring is the strong characters, represented by several A-grade actors (although, I come from anime so it matters very little to me over their performance in itself).Overall, a very solid piece, with some truly great moments in its 2:30 hours of runtime."
16 May 2007,compactDiSc,0,2,10,Best of the 90's (SPOILERS),"Director/Screenwriter Quebtin Tarantino remasters the gangster genre with this modern epic set in Los Angeles. This movie is a non-linear story, the tagline says it, 3 stories about 1. The three stories are titled ""Mia and Vincent"", "" The Gold Watch"", and ""The Bonnie Situation"". This film is my favorite movie of all time. The reasons are the dialog which is pure perfection all the way. The directing is great. I don't mean Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese great, but its really good. The main thing is the acting which its incredible. Before this movie came out nobody ever heard or talked about Samuel L. Jackson or Uma Thurman. Bruce Willis established himself as an actor in this movie. this movie has written perfection all the way. People call this a black comedy, I have to agree with this statement. Some examples are Jules' cussing and Marvin's death which is pretty hilarious.This film deserves a 4/4 this movie is just all that and a bag of chips."
10 December 2001,coollibo,0,1,9,A movie which could stand the test of time.,"It's a great movie full of genius and has something affect directly viewer's thought. It is a 'pure' movie which includes elements only belongs to movie art itself. I was moved by it's amazing structure and screenplay. Sometimes the real artist does not come from college but from life. Because knowledge and rules of art always restrict artist's  inspiration and perception, not on the contrary. Quentin Tarantino is a good example.The Pulp Fiction contributes a lot to modern movie art.It can stand the test of years although it's not so prestigious like The Godfather."

24 October 2007,tk5450,0,1,8,Great acting in a great story..,"I was at first a little skeptic about this title, because it seemed kinda weird. I had, however been told that it was pure genius, and now i see why.It is a very special movie, not the typical action flick from the 90ties, and that makes it pretty special. There is something old school and ""this is how its meant to be"" feel over it, even if its the first time you see it . The crew and acting is simply fantastic.. the actors is merging into their rules incredibly good. I have not seen any another movie which actually make it around so many themes in the runtime, while still keeping the original theme of gangsters and action put, this is obviously due to a great director who knows what he wants and how he should do it. The ending scene with Samuel L Jackson is pretty damn nice, i really like it.. GO watch this movie, there is loads of good material in it, great acting and a good story. Might not seem like the average actionmovie but the difference is in this case for the better!"
27 December 2007,quentintarantinojr,0,2,9,My Personal Favorite,"I defy those who call this a bad movie (though I know that's a minority). It isn't trying to send a message. It's just three entertaining stories. Tarantino's speciality is outrageous realistic fiction, with pointlessly hilarious conversations in between these events. The opening, where it tells what ""pulp"" content is tells us what the film will be. It's supposed to be violent, with profanity, and drugs. Tarantino though a weirdo with a big ego and a huge chin who works on a lot of crap, is my favorite director. I even liked ""Death Proof"" and his part in ""Four Rooms."" He isn't really aiming to please everyone. Pulp Fiction was a fictional story with pulp material. If your not into that, it's not for you. Tarantino's choice of dialogue is justified, at least in my opinion, by one thing. His characters are complete losers and jerks! Travolta's, and apparently Jackson's characters are on heroine. Stoltz is a dealer, Willis is frustrated boxer, etc. I don't recommend that word choice, though. ""Pulp"" isn't everyones type, but it is what it's supposed to be. In my opinion, very entertaining, hilarious for odd reasons, an overall classic. It's number 5 spot on the top 250 is well deserved."

Plot, well..is borderline ok and I found the whole ""point"" of the movie dull. After seeing it multiple times and after discussing it with a few friends, still plain ok.By no means a BAD flick, worth watching just see to see what people seem to praise. However I'd stick to something more interesting, with a better plot and a better message. See it, and try not to weep it. Sit down, have something GOOD to eat, the movie wont surpass the fabulous snacks. I surely wont go out to buy this into my movie collection unless it comes extremely cheap.** out of ****"

However, once I got older, and more into this kind of film... I viewed again and realized what I missed before.  This film is a modern classic in every way, shape and form.  The dialogue is untouchable... so many memorable lines, Tarantino actually makes profanity sound like poetry.  I'm sure everybody knows the plot of the film by now, so I won't get into that.  It's just one of those genuine, unique original pieces of cinema that will never be forgotten.  I just have to say, if you haven't seen ""Pulp Fiction"", go and see it, now!  You won't regret it.  There is lots of profanity, but come on people... it's just words, and it sounds beautiful.  The violence isn't quite as bad as its sometimes made out to be.

15 June 2015,devonw13,0,1,10,"Brilliant Dialogue, Phenomenal Acting And An Immaculate Storyline","Pulp Fiction is iconic for its mature content, which include brutal violence and rape, strong language and graphic drug use. As well-known this movie is for that, it is even more iconic due to its mind blowing dialogue, breath taking performances and the fact that plot is near flawless. This film shows the individual stories of colourful and rather vile characters that intertwine in redemption and of course violence. Directing and writing a style such as this is hard to do without making a couple mistakes, but when you put such an immense genius like Quentin Tarantino behind the camera, a masterpiece is inevitable. Samuel Jackson portrays Jules Winnfield, an unforgettable character that is given lines that are impossible to disremember, as well as his on screen partner, Vincent Vega. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer demonstrate two diner bandits, whom at the beginning of the movie, stage a piece of dialogue that will never be overlooked. Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman issue roles as a violent gangster and an unpredictable wife who with John Travolta produce the most famous ""dance"" scene in cinema history. Bruce Willis presents the character Butch Coolidge, who is famed for his quotes and background story. Pulp Fiction will blow your mind."

I sat through at the time what was a jaw dropping, eye popping, dark comedy with a bit of action and characters that you wished you could say you knew in your own life. Little did I know that I was watching the film that would be imitated and flat-out copied more than any other movie of the 90's.

Tarantino is a magnificent director who is not afraid to do what he wants in a movie(obvious for this one), and he is not afraid to act, which he is good at, and he has the perfect role in it. I particularly love the Tarantino does his films long and with different and wild stories(bring out the Gimp). He also always has an all star cast. What other director could do what he did that shortly in his career. Like me Tarantino is a big movie buff and he knows what hes doing and this movie catches Evered's attention. It's a great film."

Entertainment being the most crucial ingredient in this film, it is both funny, sad, gripping and thought provoking. The characters, even the minor ones, are rounded and believable and the directing is just, well it's pure Tarantino :) Amazingly written, acting and produced. For me, the greatest of them all."

18 February 2012,aero2558,1,2,9,More of a question than a review........,"9 of 10 'nough said from my point of view. Comparables would be Band of Brothers, No Country for Old Men, Good Fellas and the entire Sopranos Series - for reference.The question is - I'm looking for a poster, I have some awesome ones, I'm not a collector and they are in a portion of my house where they are rarely seen - they just gotta be good - make me smile. At any rate - I've seen a cartoony one with Jules and Vincent that is pretty great, but I've seen one by Tarantino w/ all characters in cartoon(not sure what the appropriate term would be) that is AWESOME. Is that out there for sale or is it some Holy Grail that I will never ever find? Anyone know?"
22 February 2008,thrilleriza15,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction really is a classic,"Pulp Fiction has really gotten me into Tarantino's works, and this is the perfect movie to showcase his talents. This is a small-time gangster story, set in LA, but pretty much subverts the traditional Goodfellas-esquire manner we are used to.For starters, the characters are developed in a way which makes us care about their fates, with conversations over things like what a big-mac is called in Europe early on. John Travolta and SLJ have a wonderful rapport on screen, delivering lines wittily, and sharply. A good thing, as the film is driven by a clever and disarming script, so none of the 148 minutes run-time feels wasted.The non-chronological narrative certainly helps to keep things fresh, and coupled with Tarantino's stylish use of cinematography, and trademark framing shots, making this film something very different to anything else on offer.Overall, this film is Definitely worth your time and money, (and a second viewing to appreciate all the nuances that make it so special), and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Fantastic work."
26 March 2005,kjoo6,1,4,10,The Greatest Movie of All Time.,"Quite a bold statement: ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"" isn't it? AFI and IMDb might disagree with me on this one statement. People will watch many movies throughout their life and will pick certain ones to be their ""favorites"". Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie. It is the quint- essential crime/adventure movie. There has never been a movie that has entertained me more than Pulp Fiction. The only other movies that I never wanted to end were A Clockwork Orange, Boogie Nights, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Based on these statements, I might be labeled as a dumb teen who glorifies violence and sex. This isn't true; I enjoy movies that take me on a ride that I won't forget. Pulp Fiction is an adventure I won't soon forget.Pulp Fiction is directed by Quentin Tarantino. He is an eccentric, a madman, a genius. He created this film which combines all of the essential elements that make a movie great. The movie has an all-star cast, unforgettable dialogue, and fantastical intertwining stories. To enlighten you of the details of the movie wouldn't be fair, as it would fall short of the actual experience. It must be experienced. The movie is of (cliche alert): epic proportions. The movie is also not for everyone. Many people are uncomfortable with profanity, violence, and rape. But for those who can easily handle such elements will agree with me in saying that Pulp Fiction is the most well-made and most entertaining movie of all time. So let me say this, Pulp Fiction is ""The Greatest Movie of All Time""... to people like me.The cast includes: Samuel L. Jackson. John Travolta. Harvery Keitel. Ving Rhames. Uma Thurman. Amanda Plummer. Tim Roth. Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarantino.The movie was written by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary.The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino.It is pure gold."
13 June 2018,ffggqqpewpew,0,0,10,One of the coolest movies ever made,"As a huge Tarantino fan I believe this is his best movie. Pulp Fiction has it all; a cool style (with the soundtrack, the scenes, the cuts, the intertitles), iconic characters that have become classics (restarting a few careers in the meanwhile), it lightheartedly tells and connects multiple interesting stories with a fast pace, you get the classic Tarantino blood&violence that is just the right amount for this movie (unless you want to watch a full-blown action movie) and the classic Tarantino dialogue that you can't not love unless you are a bore.It is easy to argue that anyone who likes watching movies can enjoy Pulp Fiction as it is one of the most FUN movies ever to watch, it is never too serious, has great music, great dialogue (realistic, easy to follow), great (at times funny) violent action scenes. That is not to say this is a simple lowest common denominator movie, Tarantino is just too honest to create a pretentious, hard-to-watch work."

It perfectly describes the stories of several separate characters and how their lives connect in some way. I loved this movie since I was 8 years old(despite the fact that I did not understand all of it). Kudos to all of the acting as well. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson have so much chemistry as two gangsters who have different perspectives on their line of work. The other members of the cast are hilarious as well. ...And then theirs the writing(directing, and acting) that Quentin Tarantino brings to the table. He brings us such odd and familiar points of discussion in this movie.I'm sorry I have wasted your time because you could have been watching this movie instead."

The script is pure gold and is so ingeniously clever, funny, compelling and cool.People say how films like, Casablanca, The Godfather, Chinatown and Brief encounter have really good scripts,(don't get me wrong the Godfather and Chinatown are both really good.) but they don't have the wit and dazzling performances to up to match Pulp fiction.It also has some of the greatest quotes ever - Ezekiel 25:17, you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris, foot massage and I'm about to get medieval on your ass.What other film has the balls to kill one of the main characters half way through the film? Tarantino also single handedly brought John Travolta's career back to life in the role of Vince.The music is amazing in this movie, the beginning credits with Misirlou running over them is such a rush, the film is also hilarious to such an extent you can almost hear Tarantino cracking up behind the camera.This film is a masterpiece and I cannot praise it enough. If you are into films and haven't seen this film yet, i highly recommend."

The only thing this movie is missing is a theme, which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. You don't have to think too much about it, it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. The first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was WHATTTT??? The second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. I really can't explain why i like the movie so much, it just sort of stuck with me. John Travolta and Sam Jackson are incredible, they show what hit men talk about when they aren't killing people. Uma Thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit men's boss's wife. Simply put this movie is incredible, but it may take you two viewings. Ten stars from me."
3 December 2018,samuallemano,0,1,10,Tarantino's script is just perfect.,"Few films can capture that glorious aesthetic that accompanied 90s cinema, but with every other line being used in millions of conversations since its release, it's more than apparent Tarantino knew exactly what he was working with and shot for the moon ."

I haven't seen anything to highlight his embellishment of Ezekiel.  If you care, the verse goes like this:""I shall perform frightful acts of vengeance & inflict furious punishments on them; & they will know that I am Yahweh, when I exact my vengeance on them.""Nice and simple. Nothing about the paths of righteous man beset by the inequities of good men."

8 November 2012,mantaker,1,2,10,Great Movie from Quentin Tarantino. Love it.,"A masterpiece of nonlinear story telling. Precursor for a lot of Tamil movies like Aaytha Ezhuthu, Virumandi.,Pulp Fiction is structured around three distinct but interrelated story lines. One of the best pictures ever. Though profanity is abundant, it is needed and thus a R rating. Uma Thurman, Travolta & Samuel Jackson did their part very well.Abundant user of profanity, violence, and pop culture references etc., Since it is a Quentin Tarantino movie, not much of explanation is really needed. Its great as is.A cult classic, everybody must watch at least twice."

                        ",What can I say? It's brilliant.,"I've been wanting to see Pulp Fiction for a long time, and I finally got to see it the other night.  Is it the best film of the 90's?  Not quite.  I'd put Saving Private Ryan above it, but that's the only film that I can of at the moment (admittedly, I haven't seen Schindler's List).  In fact, Private Ryan is the only movie that I can think of AT ALL that is better.  It's easily one best fims of all time.  Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely brilliant, the best written that I've heard in a movie so far.  The acting is incredible, as is the direction.  Well, you get the idea.  It's awesome. If you haven't seen it, get off of your computer and go to Blockbuster of whererver and rent it!  You won't regret it.My score: 9.5 out of 10NOTE: While it's an awesome movie, I should note that it's also filled with objectional stuff.  The F-word is used well over 200 times, as are many other profanities.  The violence is graphic and brutal.  There's also a brief, almost totally off-screen homosexual rape scene.  Yeah, it's not for kids.  But still, if you can stomach all of that stuff (as can I), you'll love Pulp Fiction."
25 November 1998,Killgore.,0,2,6,Vulgar and debased.,"Pulp Fiction is about a cast of vulgar, disgusting characters and their debased lives. This film centers around four different stories; two hit men accidentally shoot preteen informant in the back of their car, a boxer that refuses to throw a fight, and a doped upped hit man takes his drug dealing pimp daddy's coke head wife on a date and a hit man is `saved'. The stories are separate but come together like a bad episode of Seinfeld. Just to be cool and `avant-guard' Tarantino picked up his script and shuffled the pages together, added a thick smattering of pop culture riddled dialogue, and plagiarized every movie ever made.There is not one redeeming character or idea in this movie. Most hail it as deep, but  but that is only because they are shallow. I have questioned many of the film's devotees as to why they like it, but they can scarcely say more than `its cool' or they comment on it being glamourous-$500 cocaine baggies of heroin and $5 milkshakes. On its own terms, the movie is poorly crafted. Its much appraised non-linear story line is nothing new. Orson Wells challenged that institution 50 years ago with Citizen Kane. This doesn't enhance the story at all, except blunting Vincent Vega's (Travolta) pointless demise. He is alive when the credits roll, so he essentially avoids the repercussions of his actions. And finally,  Jules' (Jackson) misquoting scriptures and misapplication of the text was highly annoying. Besides, because he `found God', he is absent when his partner needed him the most. So by Tarantino's definition, God is as debased as the characters portrayed in this horrible movie. The only thing that is redeeming in this movie is the soundtrack. Maybe Tarantino should have been a DJ."
30 May 2009,jonsnowboarder1,1,2,10,The best movie ever made,"I have probably watched Pulp Fiction over 50 times. It is always so much fun to quote with friends and showing the movie to someone who has never seen it before is like giving them the gift of loving movies, which is what happened to me when I first saw it. The first reason for it's greatness is Quentin Tarintino, the director, who combines various techniques from multiple genres, mostly spaghetti westerns and french new wave, and puts his own unique twist on it. This makes for a completely original movie that includes all the great things from other classic movies. Another reason for the greatness of this movie is the acting. John Travolta gives a brilliant performance that many believe is the reason for jump-starting his career. also, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis. there are many other numerous things that make this movie great, including the music, small roles from Tim Roth and Christopher Walken, and 3 amazing stories that intertwine to create ultimate entertainment. I recommend this movie to everyone and hope that this helps you decide to pick it up and watch it."

I just thought that ""three hours of talking, who cares""? But when I saw the movie second time...I was completely blown away. Bruce Willis, as bad as he wants to be, gives everything he got while playing the role of Butch. He is frustrated, angry, scared and out of is mind at the same time. Well, who wouldn't be if he had a mob like Ving Rhames tryin' to catch him... John Travolta and Samuel Jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen. Travolta, a gentleman hoodlum, tries to talk sense to Jackson, who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment. Uma Thurman plays her role like it's in her blood. She plays Mia Wallace, a drug addict and mob's wife. She kinda reminds me of Courtney Love... It is amazing, how Quentin Tarantino can make a conversation about European fast food restaurants sound interesting. Tarantino is genius, I tell you, genius. A three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring, but this is anything but that. Damn, I shouldn't have written this. Now I want to watch it again..."

I saw it on the first night it opened in Sioux City, Iowa.  I think a lot of people had 'heard' about it, but I knew the audience I was seeing it with just wasn't getting it.

I know this is only early in his career but  the dialogue content of the film ranks it certainly as the best of the 90's and up there with anything else. The characters are believable in every sense, motion, speech, action and consequences of their action. The non linear plot makes its content work regardless of the dialogue. Also contains the revival of John Travolta as a Hollywood force and Samuel L Jackson best ever perfomance. An outstanding social commentary and altogether fantastic film. You must see this."

                        ",Wonderfully scripted.,"Vincent and Jules [Travolta and Jackson] are a sheer delight to watch as two erins men who work for gangster boss Wallace.[Rhames].
Willis is good as usual , subsequently with one or two mundane scenes , but this is barely recognized as the films clever interweaving of three crime stories presents colourful characters along with dialogue of immense interest.Watch out for Keitel's commanding role as Winston Wolf and Tarrantino's thought felt 'dead nigger storage' speech - exquisite acting.
The film re-established Travolta as a major Hollywood star and Tarrantino's Academy Award for his original screenplay was richly deserved .

15 December 1999,suredeath,0,0,10,"Brilliant, in one word","Pulp Fiction definitely is a knockout film. Apart from the intelligent, original and refreshing chronological intertwine of different storylines, the brilliant script is a gem. It succeeds in making the mix of absurdly gross and directly shot violence and all day chit-chat more than believable. Where else have you seen a guy commenting on the quality of his victim-to-be's Kahunaburger and asking him a sip of his beverage to wash it down seconds before pumping everyone in the room full-o-lead  ? When did you last see a scene in which one of the 2 bad guys accidently ""erase"" their captive's brains during a car ride and then discuss the mess it creates, the bump in the road that caused this and who's supposed to clean up, without worrying even the slightest about the man's death ? Not to speak of Walken in a small role handing Willis the watch that, according to his monologue, sat years in someone's there-where-the-sun-don't-shine before being handed on, without being completely unbelievable ? All this completed with a cool worth-wile soundtrack (very retro-sixties/seventies), a great well-picked cast and the magic Tarantino touch, this movie ROCKS."

                        ",Bruce Willis and one tiny piece of Tarantino trivia.,"Bruce Willis is an unsung hero of Pulp Fiction.  Time after time, you can see flickers of his character's conflicting and complicated thoughts on Willis' face, and then see it snuffed by Butch's hard attitude.  Also, Tarantino fans might get a kick out of the fact that Travolta's character (Vincent Vega) has the same last name as ""Mr.Blond"" (as played by Michael Madson in Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992)).  Vincent and Vic Vega. Brothers?  Do any other viewers know about implied family connections between Tarantino's films?  If you haven't seen this film yet, keep in mind that it can be a little sarcastic about ""hard reality"" and intentionally goes over the top."

                        ",The question is: what lies beneath the surface.,"Pulp Fiction fascinates in many ways. Under it´s delusive external surface you can find great irony. Tarantino shows us every possible kinds of repulsive characters and ugly situations. Satire certainly isn´t an easy genre: neither for creators nor for audience. Everything you see in this marvellous film is opposite of the purpose. Where Tarantino aims to, is to make fun of the vanity of violent action films. The movie treats current problems in film-making: superficiality and distorted values. We are entitled to get a good laugh in Pulp Fiction many times, but why? Enjoying the endless cruelties? No. Because of the discriminating critic against immorality? Yes."

The more I think about it the more I become convinced that Pulp Fiction will be seen as a milestone in American filmmaking.For one, it is simply an incredible film in it's own right.  Wonderfully drawn characters, an incredibly compelling non-linear storyline, and dialogue that shaped popular culture. From a historical perspective, however, it also represents a lot.  It represents the emergence of independent films.  Before Pulp Fiction independent films were a rarity for the Academy Awards, and now at least one best picture slot is guaranteed for them.  It also virtually created the careers of John Travolta, now one of the top box office draws, Sam Jackson, and Quentin Tarantino.But most importantly it raised the bar in so many ways.  The way it told the story, that gags it used to get laughs and thrills at the same time, and every other element of the film are now the standard that every other movie should be held to.   An incredible film, and an incredibly important one as well."

Martin and Lewis was a vanilla Milkshake, and Amos and Andy, a chocolate. Later i found out that Martin and Lewis were a white comedy twosome, and Amos and Andy, and black comedy twosome. Then there is always debate with this film. In the movie, there is a brief case that has the code ""666"" well that is the sign of the devil. And some think that in the brief case is a characters soul (Marsellus Wallace) But thats a bunch of bull. Then there is the Band- Aid on the back of Marsellus's neck, some think that is the incision the Devil used to rip out his soul. That is definitely not true because the Only reason the Band-Aid was there was because the make up artist could not hide a scar in the back of Ving Rhames (Marsellus Wallace) neck. So the Band-Aid was applied. And the way the movie is shot is brilliant. At times there are scenes where you expect to be RIGHT IN on the action. The whole point of some films is to make you believe you are in the action. But Quentin Tarantino keeps the camera away at times. Like when Butch (Bruce Willis) is talking to his girlfriend Fabienne about going to Mexico after Tennesse. Normally the camera would be positioned right in the action going from person to person. But Tarantino makes you think you are eaves dropping on the conversation by keeping the camera back out of the bathroom and distance away looking in. There are also many tributes to Quentin's favorite movies (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Curdled, Urban Cowboy...and many more) My final decision is to run, walk, steal, and kill to see this movie. It wont be that hard to find, some suggestions are Best Buy, Circuit City or Blockbuster. Pulp Fiction is THE RIDE OF A LIFETIME and deserves to be seen by everyone that loves movies. For this will become your favorite movie of all time i promise...WILL"
26 April 2006,gmendy_393,0,1,10,Tarantino at his finest!!!!!,"This movie is a brilliantly intricate story of Vincent and everyone connected to him within a two day time line. No doubt Tarantino's best work next to Reservoir Dogs and some of the best music. Samuel L. Jackson should'voe gotten an Oscar for his performance. I may be Jewish but I have still memorized Jackson's Bible quote. It's on my top ten list and won't ever come off! A definite masterpiece for all time and I have a bad feeling it will be remade in 10 years or so with no success. No one can live up to this timeless masterpiece. They can sure try if they want to, but they can't replace it. Ladies and gentlemen, Pulp Fiction!"

27 November 2010,turchinjjake,1,2,10,my all time favorite movie,"their are a lot of films now a days that are just so bland and uninteresting. but this film comes to none of that, every second of this movie is just so fascinating from the dialoge that some characters share, or just the insanity of the situations that occurs. in my opinion this film is just about how crazy life can get, and quentin tarintino takes it as far as possible. the acting is great in this movie, but even if this movie had terrabel acting it wouldent matter, because this dialog is jut so realistic that any one can pull it off. but overall this movie just fascinates me, every time i see this movie, there's something new i notice about it. ill see the camera do something i've never seen before, or ill learn something new about the characters i did'nt know before. its a wild ride from start to finish. i adore this movie to death"

                        ",classical? why not?,"before having the pulp fiction dvd, i had heard people say it so brilliant again and again. in the top 250 movies list, it ranks 19. and i knew it had won the best film award in 1994 Canne. naturally, i should be longing for this movie for years, just as for memento, usual suspects or mulholland drive. yes, i found it at last in the dvd shop. i would not wast a second to play it in my laptop. roughly 3 hours' glance imprinted another classical in my mind. Queutin, the director, is a genius. the theme of love and redemption was presented in such a moving way.  the 3(or 4) seem to be independent, while they are inter-related. the chronical order of narration was broken apart and replaced by a confused disarrangement. in the second scene, jules shot a man down for his boss and then the movie turned to the fourth secene when jules and vincent were already in their boss' place. only at the end of moive, the skipped part of jules' redemption, the main theme of the film, was presented on the screen. why this?? the period of the rougly 3hours of the film is simply indicating the whole long process of jules' salvation. the magic bullets inspired jules of god's love that persuaded him to put the pistol aside in the restaurant and quit the gangs life(he did do so, for in the latter part he didn't show again); however. in contrary, vincent didn't realize this and stayed in, thus he was killed by potch just like a tomato that failed to catch up getting smashed up and becoming ketchup! this movie deserves such a reputation and is worth reviewing hundreds of times. thankx, Queutin!"

The dialogue is so inventive and intriguing, the plot is difficult (yes, it may be over some of you simpletons heads) and forces yo to think.  It is funny, entertaining and warrants stimulating discussion.  The cast is phenomenal and most of these actors were probably honored to appear in it.  Not too mention, this film revived travolta's career, and he BEGGED Tarantino for his part.""A lot of actors made a wise decision when the appeared in the Film Pulp Fiction"" - Inside the actors studio.I hate to sound judgemental and pompous, but if you do not like this film, you are slow minded, dull, and ignorant."
13 November 2010,tiziano-gennari,1,2,10,An amazing film!,"This movie, despite the fact that I have now seen it more than 20 times, never gets old and certainly never fails to impress. The actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of. The scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it, but I assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you. This movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be.Many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyone's mind.This is my opinion on the film, it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend it."

It simply unfolds in front of you, as if it doesn't really notice you're there. A lot of movies seem to follow guidelines, and simple plots. This movie is far from that type, it was chaotic and exciting throughout. The acting was also superb and made you forget it was a movie every now and then. This is a movie any self proclaimed ""Movie junkie"" should see. So why didn't this movie receive a perfect 10 from me? This movie has flaws like many great movies. Flaws that kept it from being a 10, but they don't keep it from being a classic, that's for sure."

                        ",My generation's work of art,"I and most of my friends use this movie to separate peers into two groups- those who understand something and those who don't.Us: ""So what do you think of Pulp Fiction?"" Them: ""Yeah, yeah.  I saw that in high school, it was funny.  But did you see Shawshank?!""Thus, in the above episode, ""Them"" has placed him or herself squarely within the group of people who do not understand.This is the first movie that everyone my age saw, besides maybe ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"" that made you believe in its profound relevance no matter what it did.  Two characters discuss MacDonalds in Europe, and you believe.  A woman traces a visible rectangle in thin air with her fingers, and you don't know why, but you believe.  The confidence of the dialogue, perhaps, or the sublimely offhanded complexity of the plot.It also features career-making performance from every one of its actors. This is the movie that defined comeback with John Travolta, and that defined Samuel L. Jackson in the first place.  Uma Thurman could walk off the screen and you wouldn't notice.  Bruce Willis makes you realize who Bruce Willis really is.  And in a Tarantino tradition foreshadowed by ""True Romance,"" Christopher Walken's one scene is achingly nuanced and hilarious, the closest thing I know of to perfect.Pulp Fiction is simply the most important and best movie of the 1990's and, therefore, since the 70's.  If you haven't seen it and you're older than 16, you must must do so, right now.And I like Shawshank a lot, by the way."

I'm not in the right generation to have loved this movie from when it first came out, but I watched my first Tarantino movie with a friend, and it was Resevior Dogs of all things.  I admit that this man is a movie genious - the plotlines to both RD and PF are so awesome that they actually leave me thinking - unlike most movies.In both movies, plots are great, characters are great, actors are great, direction is great, and I can't seem to find anything wrong, at all, about either of these movies.  Throwing himself into the movie as a character, Tarantino's acting was awesome and I'd love to personally thank the man for this movie if I could.  I love the story intervention of Pulp Fiction - they all just connect and at the end of the movie you just go ""ahhhh! I get it!"". I love it.  I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see any talent in movies, and if the DVD wasn't due back tomorrow I'd watch this over and over and over.  I'm sure I'll buy it when I can conjure up the money because there is nothing I love more than a movie you can watch multiple times.I'd put this in my top three list, the other two movies being ""Resevior Dogs"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"".  I haven't even said anything about those, but they'd get better reviews than even this beast of a movie.  I love it, you should rent/buy it, because only a doofus can not like this movie. Watch it!  -TheVanillaNinja"
4 July 2006,bayshore999-1,0,3,10,An enduring classic,"Pulp Fiction is one of the great films of all time, one that will endure from generation to generation, each finding new things to admire. When it was first released twelve years ago, it was liked mostly for its ""post-modernism,"" its exhibition of the superficiality and meaningless or life, and its own obvious fictionality. There's a word in post-modern vocabulary that describes this vision of the world -- ""simulacra."" Life is made up merely of fleeting and empty images. And Tarantino finds innumerable ingenious ways of pointing out that this is just a film -- but that life is like a film too.This all remains true, but repeated viewings have shown me how richly Tarantino develops this theme. The film is littered with little puzzles that are *meant* not to make sense, deliberately destroying our ""suspension of disbelief."" To cite just two examples, why is the wealthy and powerful Marcellus walking through a bad part of Los Angeles with a bag of groceries? Why does even Marcellus bend over backwards to appease the modestly-incomed Jimmy, Tarantino's character, just because his wife -- a nurse -- will find a dead body in the garage and ask for a divorce? (I have a possible solution: it's because Tarantino remains the director of the film, even within the film. He's in charge.) One could go on and on. This film is hilariously funny, superbly edited, brilliantly acted, richly knowledgeable about the history of film -- just end to end brilliant. There was a time when I thought I was being quite a ""purest"" by saying that I preferred Reservoir Dogs, which is great in its more limited way. But Pulp Fiction, in its breadth and ambition, is Tarantino's masterpiece, and up there with the very greatest films of all time."

The movie was slow but kept you wanting for more. I loved the cast and all their attitudes and of course the people that played them. The movie is about three hours which most people can not stand, like in King Kong or The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King. I always wondered why it only won one Oscar. In my opinion it should have won best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best supporting actress (Uma Thurman). It did win best original screenplay which is better than nothing. Future directors should always see this movie and I hope there will be more movies like this in the future."

                        ","This movie had an emotional impact, the equivalent of which I've never experienced, from a movie.","I don't know where to begin.The 'shooting up' and the 'breastplate' scenes were placed perfectly within the line-up of spellbinding puzzle pieces, that compose this film. Perhaps I'm a bit squemish, but those scenes brought my utter engrossment to an apex.  I thought I might faint, even.The dialogue of 'Pulp Fiction' is made up of the most interesting, eclectic conversations you might ever hear.The soundtrack elicits emotion barely surpassed by the heroin scenes.The scene organization sets an all-time prescedent.The plot is only fantastically compelling.Comparing films from 1994 to 1944 films is not fair, especially in the current social context.  That makes it difficult to call this the greatest film of all time.  I do defy anyone to come up with a more emotionally impactful movie than 'Pulp Fiction.'"
3 January 2022,dadaevanwang,1,3,3,I don't get it,"I cannot recall how many people say this is their favarious movie so I watched it today. I have checked many reviews and articles after seeing this movie because I felt confused about its super popularity.People love it because of its non-linear narrative, dialogues, aroma, the beauty of violence, etc. But I just don't get much of it. This is a movie of multiple stories connected by some magic logic, where a personal choice by one character impacted how the story goes. But up to the end of the movie, I still don't get what the director is trying to express.Maybe I will rewatch one day and try to find some hidden meanings under the plot."
9 July 2003,toysinthebasement,1,2,9,Clever piece of film-making,"Tarantino has created one of the seminal movies of the 90s, depicting the sleazier side of American culture and setting new standards for cool. Everything from the soundtrack to the dialogue to the settings oozes style, and the substance isn't half bad either.The plot is concerned with a variety of characters, and how their stories intertwine. The non-chronological method of storytelling may be confusing the first time round, but this is a film that you'll want to see again and again in order to fully absorb the lightning pace.Special mentions must go to Mr. L. Jackson and Mr. Travolta for their hilarious turns as quick-talking gangsters, who are involved in some of the films funniest conversations.All-in-all, a must-see movie with a reputation that does not over-exaggerate its greatness."
13 July 2003,optimysticbob,1,2,10,It is QUENTessential movie. The one that ties everything in the universe of film together.,"Okay, maybe that summary is overstating it a bit. Still, I love this film more than any other piece of art (be it motion picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, written word or performance) in the world. Pulp Fiction has kidnapped my senses completely for two and a half at a time, nearly a hundred times.There's no reason to explain for there have been far too many explanations already. But there's Vincent Vega aimlessly stepping through nostalgia personified in the 50's themed diner, Jack Rabbit Slim's. Then you've got a tight shot of Jules Winnfield's expression of wrath as he turns around to say ""-And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and FURRRRIOUSSS anger..."". Mia Wallace's dirty bare foot. A drop of liquid from a thin needle, three feet above Mia's chest. ""Bacon tastes goood. Porkchops taste gooood."" ""What does it feel like to kill a man with your bare hands? It is a topic I'm very interested in."" ""Blueberry pie to match the pancakes.""
I romanticize it too damn much, I know it. But it all just clicks for me. It all makes so much sense. Everytime I watch it I feel supreme satisfaction, knowing I just got a perfect helping of the marriage of image and storytelling.I don't know if I should even try to justify, defend or promote the film because I feel that it is beyond all of that. I just hope that my quick, little blurb here successfully displays the deep emotional connection I have to Pulp Fiction. That alone has GOT to say something to someone who has their doubts about it. If it knocked me out, as it did, give it a chance and it might give you a good punch too."

Mobsters, guns, drug use... etc. Its just boring. Every scene screams ""Hey look at me I'm cool!"" Every scene screams for your attention. Tarantino tries too hard to make you pay attention to him.

Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent.

The title Pulp Fiction is very self- explainatory, but after watching it, it makes sense in the grand scheme of things. The film follows a non-linear structure which includes the story about 2 hitmen, a boxer, a robbery. The dialogue is amazing like other Quentin Taratino's works. The characters are so memorable that they've entered our culture. The story is weird, out of order just like life itself. Crimes, wrongdoings and redemption, beauty are shown simultaneously as the point of the film.

It has entertained when it came out and will continue to do so with generations because it has aged well. Tarantino has created such a memeable movie it will stand the test of time.The accuracy of the O. D. is not very accurate but suspend your hold on reality and use your imagination. It has been parodied such as in The Simpsons and has such memorable scenes. The idea of having individual stories that line up and cross paths I'm sure is not a new idea but Tarantino does a great job of using this method. Whats great is that he produced this movie on such a limited budget. Great job to everyone in this movie!!!
19 January 2022,dahar-89506,0,0,10,Tarantino is a legend,"A good example of a collection of short stories from Quentin Tarantino, linked together by a number of characters and a common idea. The plot is full of comical situations, vulgar humor, vivid scenes of violence and a strange combination of circumstances. Perhaps the film can be called a bright representative of the 90s, since it is a colorful picture whose characters commit stupidities, mistakes, crimes, getting into a bind, getting out of it by a miracle and starting a new life. The picture was shot in many places, from a taxi to the basement of the store, so there is a feeling that I watched not just a movie but ""Gone with the Wind"".

6 May 2007,ZoeScrace,0,1,9,Dialogue not action.....,"Well, I finally got around to seeing this movie. Of course, I had heard that it was a violent movie  in fact that was about all I had heard. Oh and, like most people, I'd seen the Vincent and Mia dance sequence. For me, however, my lasting impression is of the dialogue. From the opening scene (or at least the first scene in the movie), it was as if the actors had been told to talk to each other about whatever they wanted. The result is a natural flow of dialogue  sometimes comic, sometimes obscure, always believable. The subjects range from the metric system in Europe and its influence on fast food to the intimacy of foot massages. Even when there isn't anyone to talk to, there is speech  Vincent talks to himself in the mirror in the bathroom after he has taken Mia home while she overdoses in the living room. During their 'date' they even talk about how to have a conversation.Although the dialogue is natural, there is nothing muted or subtle about the colours in this film. During the 'Vincent and Mia' scene, the colours are bold and clearly defined  the characters are dressed in black and white, Mia's home is decorated in black and white. The car is red and the colours in the restaurant they go to are vibrant.There is action in this movie but it isn't an action movie. It's a clever movie of the sort that needs to be seen more than once to appreciate its various elements  and, of course, the sequence in which things happen."

Jackson) and the chaotic events that occur in one very odd day. With Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino has done what every film maker wants to do. Make a movie that everyone else wishes they had made. Tarantino started a trend when he made Pulp Fiction. Since Tarantino's classic there have been countless film-makers trying to copy and reproduce his success. The acting is excellent, the story is well written as the movie is also very brilliantly directed. I give Pulp Fiction nothing less than what it deserves and that is a straight 10 out of 10."

the ending shot. A lot has been said about it already so i don't want
to spoil the fun. All i want to say is that if you like movies and have
not seen this one, you are a loser. I am not sure what to call the best
about this flick. The plot, the shots, the music, the performances , it
is overwhelming.its never too late, watch it now. It is close to ""the perfect movie""
ever made."

19 December 2011,cjsabres16,1,2,10,incredible movie,"Pulp Fiction Movie Review Although I am only 18 years of age, barely a legal adult, I must firmly say the film ""Pulp Fiction,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the BEST film I have ever seen, hands down. The screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense, but deeply intriguing as well. The balance which is struck so masterfully by Tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular.Being a self proclaimed Tarantino fan, the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film, Reservoir Dogs. The film was nominated for over 5 Oscar awards, but ended up winning only one, Best Original Script. Winning Best Original Script is no small achievement. This award is a testament to the quality and time that Tarantino puts into each of his movies, and the script and plot line in ""Pulp Fiction"" is no different.Additionally, the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie. The star cast includes Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames. Jackson and Travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men, contracted to certain jobs by their boss, Ving Rhames. Bruce Willis plays the other hit men that has a personal ""beef"" with the boss of Jackson and Travolta. Uma Thurman stars as the wife of Ving Rhames. Finally, Roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film. Each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films, showing the quality of each actor. Together, all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film.After receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media, ""Pulp Fiction"" finally won an Oscar, best screenplay. This is by far the most original and well made film that I have ever seen. Many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is ""unorganized"" and has no ""true story line."" I couldn't disagree with this statement more.The way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary. For example, the main storyline in the movie is the combination of Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), two hit men that work for Marcellus (Ving Rhames). At times, the film will show the two men carrying out hits, extorting money, or extracting information by ""all means necessary."" One of the prime examples of this is the ""apartment scene,"" in which Jackson and Travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men, believed to be holding cash and information.After they ask a few questions, poke around for a bit, and find what they need, they make sure that all of the men are dead, preventing them from causing future problems. This is meant to show the ""business savvy"" side of Travolta and Jackson, and evoke intense emotion from the viewer. But in the next scene, a completely different type of John Travolta is shown, which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience.As Travolta and Jackson's boss leaves town, his boss, Mia (Uma Thurman), asks Travolta to take her on a date. Both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet, making for an interesting line of action. Travolta takes her to a 1950's diner which doubles as a dance club at night. As the scene progresses, Thurman volunteers them for a dance, much to the dismay of Travolta. Travolta reluctantly accepts, following Thurman to the stage. The dance goes well, as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd. But, this is just the beginning of a disastrous night.As the two leave the diner, they return to Thurman's house. As Travolta goes to the bathroom, Mia discovers a bag of heroin, which she mistakes to be cocaine. As Travolta comes back to the living room, he finds her lying on the ground, motionless, with blood running down her nose. This leads Travolta to believe that it is an OD. Travolta brings Thurman to a friend's house, where she is administered an adrenaline shot, straight to the heart. This sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow, suspenseful action with intense, on the edge of your seat emotion. No other director has the talent or formula to combine drama, action, mystery, and suspense all into one screenplay besides Tarantino. Grossing over $107,000,000 lifetime, many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well (Boxofficemojo.com). Each time I watch the movie, I realize that it is one of the FEW films that I can enjoy every single time. The legendary actors, skillful directing, and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece. In my opinion, that is why ""Pulp Fiction"" is the greatest film of all time."

                        ",Inventive and thoroughly original modern classic,"The fact that Pulp Fiction has inspired so many wannabe crime spectaculars is a testament to its originality, which, in a close finish, is the greatest aspect of this film.  It surprised me with its tangents of craziness and fascinating characters, and rarely have I found a recent movie that I have wanted to view repeatedly to pick up the little aspects of.  The film, amazingly, makes you forget the surrounding factors (such as the bloodshed, the suburban drug-grubbing LA area, etc.) and makes you focus on the characters and the dialogue.Some have considered Pulp Fiction a superficially ambiguous film, with throwaway diatribes and few new comments on crime life from writer-director Quentin Tarantino's first stark film, Reservoir Dogs (1992).  True, Pulp Fiction does feature a lot of the same features as Reservoir Dogs, such as the gunfights and the sometimes gratuitous brutality, but to me, Tarantino is putting a new spin on well-worn filmic stories. The plot is split through three interlocking and weaving stories, and upon the end of the first viewing of the film, you find yourself saying, ""Now I remember how he got there!""  It gives the mind an added gift to toss around when considering the film's plot.Specifically, the high quality of acting stems straight from the dialogue, which (as I'm sure I've said) stands out at film's end.  The most accomplished and varied ensemble cast in recent memory all contribute performances that suck you invariably in to the scene being portrayed, with exceptional performances by the reborn John Travolta, the intriguing and searching Samuel L. Jackson, and the always bloody Bruce Willis.  As most of us know (and some who have been doing so), the screenplay is quoted in pop culture ad nauseum; how, I ask, do lines like ""This is a tasty burger!"" become useful in everyday life besides the daily trips to Wendy's?  This stands as another testament to the staying power of the dialogue, which ranges from joyful banter and gossip (the black-Samoan Antoine's predicament of being thrown from a window) to absolute lunacy (the famed ""Le Big Mac"" conversation, which borders on SNL skit material).  You laugh, and at the same time, throw up your hands.In 1992, after the initial release of Reservoir Dogs, Roger Ebert challenged the ""obviously talented"" Tarantino to make a better film.  He did just that by crafting a film worthy of the Best Picture award in a hotly-contested year for great films (don't forget Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption).  For me, the film lingers in the mind, as you try to understand just why you enjoyed this crazy film.  9/10"
9 September 2013,AwesomeFresh,3,10,6,Overrated,"This movie was alright, I mean I understand it but maybe I just don't ""get"" it. It's a pastiche (which is a fancy word for a positive, nostalgia like satire) of pulp crime movies. Okay. That's a fine premise but the rest of the movie does not compute. I enjoyed the circular and completeness of the plot but it's strange when considered in light of the characters and the themes. I think far too many people take this movie at face value, and that value is a little disappointing. I enjoyed all the actor's performances and undeniably this movie has set a genre and a wealth of movie clichés. But it's overlong and cringe-worthy at points. I just don't think it's a classic."
5 March 2004,aceofspades-1,1,2,10,Tarantino Masterpiece,"This movie has to be absolutely one of the best 5 of all time.  The directing, the dialogue, the acting, everything about this movie is flawlessly executed and thought-out.  The fact that you can't even classify this into a genre, (it is an action/comedy/drama/many other things), just speaks volumes about Tarantino's directing.  Samuel L. Jackson's monologues at the beginning (and at the end, for that matter) of the movie are so brilliantly scripted and acted out that it makes you wonder why he never received an Oscar for his performance. Ving Rhames, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Tarantino himself submit excellent roles.I give it 11 out of 10"
10 February 2016,troykerby33,0,0,10,Dialog at its finest!,"This was my first Quentin Tarantino film I had ever seen and after seeing it I think I was a little to young to understand it. I later re- watched it as an adult and fell in love. The dialog in this movie is amazing and the acting is as well. It is a ride from start to finish. This movie really showed me that you can look to a director as a star instead of just the actors. This was my gateway drug to all of Tarantino's films and I cant say I'm upset about that. Uma Thurman and Sam Jackson deliver their parts flawlessly. The plot is great and blends together well. Overall not my favorite Tarantino film (Inglorious Bastards), but obviously one of my favorite movies of all time."
4 August 2003,Aristophilis,0,1,8,This movie is highly addictive,"This is a great movie. Definitely one of the most recognizable classics of the '90's. It has probably the second best screenplay ever, after ""Snatch"" (2000) starring Brad Pitt and Alan Ford. It has also some of the coolest characters, such as Vince Vega played by Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's character. It's absolutely hilarious and it has a very laid-back style that makes it probably the ""coolest"" film of the 20th century. You have to love this movie. IF you don't, then you are not a real film-lover. Why do you think it was voted one of the 100 best movies of the last century by the American Film Institution (AFI). I would have to rank this movie as one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. A true classic."
9 January 2004,knaak1,0,2,10,The greatest in every way,"Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies ever. Quentin Tarantino has done a wonderful job, something he will never be able to reach again. It's his masterpiece. The cast is outstanding, and perfectly teamed up. The greatest duo to me is Samuel L.Jackson with John Travolta. Any director will be jealous of their dialogs. John Travolta plays very cool when goes out with Uma Thurman, who is as cool as he is. This creates an interesting sphere between them. Bruce Willis shows he is more than just an average 'Die Hard' gorilla. His scene with Ving Rhames in the store, where he choses his way of revenge on the owners, made me laugh the hardest. Christopher Walken is as serious as he is scary, when he tells about his time in Vietnam. Harvey Keitel does his best performance as a problem solver. He thinks fast, talks fast, acts fast, but is always in control of the situation. No one can do it better than himself.The story is of a no bulls*** kind. The things that aren't said, is what makes this movie so brilliant. The non chronological way makes it even more interesting to watch. Quentin knew what he was doing.I've seen this movie over and over again, but it has never bored me a single minute. The funny thing is you can sit back and relax while watching this movie, it is never too violent or too shocking. It's the funniest kind of crime, your first response is laughing. It's just the best in its genre. If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you go buy it right now."
25 March 2012,mandorka74,1,2,10,The Epitome Of A Tarantino Film,"For those unfamiliar with writer/director Quentin Tarantino's cult masterpiece Pulp Fiction, it is a twisted combination of plots that capture the very pulp of society that are evident in its title. The plot is a non-linear combination of three main stories that intertwine with the five main characters popping in and out of all of them. All three of the stories are very simplistic in theory and purposely made stereotypical by Tarantino. However, his goal was to take these classic mobster stories and add a twist to all of them. It is these aspects of Tarantino's stories that change the formula from something generic and unoriginal to three of the most intense and memorable stories of film history. The glue that progresses and ties all of these stories together is the sharp natural dialogue that Tarantino is so well known for. He is at the top of his game in Pulp Fiction providing the most natural and genuinely interesting dialogue that not only serves as something to listen to, but also actually progresses the story just as much as the character's actions do. These actions are actually what the film is most criticized for with the movie being rated R for almost everything. Some claim that the movie is just an excuse to set up extreme situations of violence and substance abuse. This has caused the film to be known for its excessive and brutal nature. However, when paying closer attention, it is quite easy to see that it is largely a story of redemption. Since the film revolves around less than moral individuals, it is not surprising to say that everyone who is killed in this movie could easily be considered a ""bad person"" but when examined, one will notice that every character that seeks forgiveness for their actions is alive when the credits roll. The soupy morals and excessive nature are what this movie is known for. For good reasons too, further supporting the choice for the title of the movie. However, the reason this movie has reached a certain level of greatness over the years is not only from its drugs and violence but also from its tangled story superb dialogue. With Pulp Fiction being the masterpiece of a director as talented as Quentin Tarantino, any movie fan owes it to themselves to see it."
23 February 2004,h0rse_m0rse,0,2,10,Masterful story-telling... but it's all about the dialogue!,"My love and appreciation of this film comes primarily from the razor-sharp quality of the script and the masterful, genius, unique style of story-telling used in this movie. This is my all time favourite movie and I love all of the scenes, in particular the ending scene, in which Samuel L Jackson does a great piece!My rating is: 10/10"
25 March 2004,gmcgreffery,0,2,10,a FANTABULOUS film,"Pulp fiction is one of those films that doesn't go in chronological order. In school we learned that this kind of writing is part of what makes some books awesome.  This film uses that story telling technique to make a truly memorable experiance.  Throughout the film you'll see small things, like people in different clothes, or something and it won't make any sense. You'll see a scene or two that feels like its from a completely different movie.  but later on tarantino makes you remember those seemingly random scenes.  Its just an amazing story that is strangely funny in parts that really shouldn't be funny.  Like the hitmen early on, you'll see what i mean. (""What kind of burger is that?"").  The humor is a little dark though.
everything from camera work, to scripting, to casting to makeup to acting is almost spotless here(except for travolta's car).  i suggest finding the collector's edition to add to the confusion (and the amazingness).
SEE THIS MOVIE"
2 September 2015,Chaa_Srinivaas,0,0,8,High Voltage Crime Flick,"First of all ,We have to talk about the non-linear story-line,punchy dialogue,mix of humor and violence. Intersecting story lines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. A perfect example for Neo-noir type film. Later of this film, the way of watching and making films were completely changed. John Travolta, Samuel L.Jackson,UmaThurman and others played a vital roles and gave their performances well. Directed in a highly stylized manner,and highly influenced other directors too. inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style. Maybe, every country with film making background made a film inspired by this. Quentin Tarantino made a benchmark in world cinema with his style of film making and step ahead."
6 August 2013,BRoz123,0,0,10,A masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece. This movie single handedly got me interested in film making and movies themselves. Quentin Tarantino writes, directs, and acts in what is hands down my favorite movie. Before watching this movie I have never experienced such joy in listening to characters interact with witty dialogue. This credit of course go to Tarantino writing in my opinion the best script ever. My favorite part about the movie though, are the characters. Tarantino brings them to life so well and effectively that it is unlike anything I've ever seen. John Travolta's performance revived his career and morphed him into a formidable movie star. This film really put Samuel L. Jackson on the map. Other performances that stand out to me(although all are great) are Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's character is so quick and hilarious with his lines yet so serious and believable. The Bonnie Situation is my favorite sequence in the movie. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career. Many will remember him for being a bad ass in die hard but I will remember him being a bad ass in Pulp Fiction. Finally, the mixed up sequences and various interpretable themes make this movie great. The briefcase and Jules speech at the end are just fantastic. This movie will always be my favorite."

                        ",Dated,"I can understand the praise this movie has received (in my experience mostly from the under-30 male population) mostly because of the society into which it was released.  In 1994 film makers, musicians, and artists of every shade were into ""pushing-the-envelope"" art.  Each generation,as they find their own voice, seems to want to shock the generation that came before it, and my generation chose senseless violence and base language to express their coming of age.In the first place, I believe this type of behaviour is silly, and non-productive.  Secondly, if it is entertaining, it is simply because it seems novel.  I do not herald Tarantino as the next great philosopher...in fact, his subsequent attempts at film making have proven Pulp Fiction to be part of the early nineties phenomenon of transforming violence, language, and sex into cool.  To get moralistic, I doubt if anyone who saw the movie would want the movie to be their reality.  So if you don't want to live it, ask yourself, why do you want to watch it?I have had arguments with people who have loved Pulp Fiction (many of whose opinions on other films I usually agree), and one thing seems to be a mainstay in their laudation of it: it was different, it was the first, it captured the imagination.  However, those kind of movies -- much like the blockbuster action movies of the 80s a la Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Segal -- have had their time and have passed away from the centre of attention. Pulp Fiction had its chance, but it failed the most enduring test of all...the test of time."
12 December 2018,agrabel88,0,1,10,The best movie ever made,"Pulp fiction is a once in a liftime kind of movie. Though i like all Quentin Tarantino movies including the four rooms segment, Pulp Fiction is by far the best. Anybody and i mean anybody who didn't like this fantastically done movie obviously doesnt know movies. Pulp fiction has everything a movie should have, it has action, drugs, suspense and to add to all of that it was funny . I wish there were more movies like pulp fiction."
23 July 2018,davidepia70,0,1,10,The best film of all times!,"No film is comparable to Pulp Fiction, especially as regards the dialogues, simply perfect and fantastic. They look like real dialogues between people secretly filmed during their interaction. Perfect recitations from everyone. All this makes the plot superfluous, which in fact has a minimum value in this film. I do not add anything else, except that you can see this film dozens of times, without getting tired."
8 June 2005,khg808,0,2,10,The Return of Vega?,"I was doing some spring cleaning this week and decided to dust off the copies of the Tarantino classics. It is amazing how great these two movies get with each passing year. In the flood of glitz and special effects that flood the big screens every summer, these two flicks just get even better by relativity.Watching Reservoir Dogs and Pulp fiction together, I saw something new for the first time. Maybe others have noticed it and I am just slow on the uptake, but there seems to be a common thread.Has anybody noticed that the character VEGA is in both Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs? I wonder if in Quentin's mind they are related? The mannerism of both characters are eerily similar. Maybe they are brothers?"
29 January 2006,MrZ_ultimateGH,0,1,10,i know it may be obvious...,"... but Pulp Fiction is still one of my favorite movies. From the beginning to the ending it's basically characters discussing things that don't really even matter and it never looses interest. It's just pure plot genius of taking it forward by with dialog unfolding it throughout the film. And I'm also quite annoyed by the fact that so many say that Tarantino's movies don't have morals. Maybe the Kill Bill saga was a bit violence for the sake of violence but Pulp Fiction certainly has a moral center to it. No doubt Tarantino enjoys the ""explotation"" of violence in his movies(with his incredible writing skills) but the whole point of the film in that last scene is completely moral. I love the movie as it watches the lives of those stories seen so many times and for the first time sarcastically seen trhough fresh eyes, but never making it too much of a joke. It's black comedy but it's also quite serious. I love it."
22 June 2004,Gudfaren_Emil,1,2,9,Great movie,"Violent, funny, unpredictable and stylish, this one's got it all.John Travolta plays unbelievably cool as the drugged hit-man Vincent, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers an equally great performance as his partner, Jules. Also worth mentioning is Bruce Willis, starring as the boxer Butch, and Johnny Walken, who delivers a long speak about a gold watch being worn in the ass for seven years by him and another private in the war, before delivering the watch to his fellow private's son.Quentin Tarantino's directing is utter class, and the story is so unpredictable that you could see it a dozen times and yet never know what's going to happen next. The writing and the music is equally good, and all in all, this is a highly recommendable movie that is sure to affect you in some way or the other. See it-Now."
11 April 2014,HerbalHammer,0,1,10,The Quintessential Tarantino film. And that's saying quite a lot.,"Not that I think this is the best movie ever made, but it sure as hell is my favorite film of all time. It is also probably one of the single most influential film ever made. Here's why:Quentin Tarantino is regarded by many to be the very best storyteller in the industry. This movie showcases this, as it never fails to impress no matter how many times you have watched it. The dialogue is the very highest point, as even pointless gibberish sounds interesting. It makes you feel more immersed into the story, and makes the characters more human and believable. I felt like I met these people, I learned a lot about their personality and taste. Then comes the absolutely sensational acting by stars including John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and the very best, Samuel L. Jackson. Every scene in this film is memorable, keeping me glued to my seat. This is not only a movie, it's an unforgettable experience."
9 June 2015,loveviggomortensen,1,7,4,worth watching but still not great of a movie,"so I've always had wanted to see this movie when I saw previews for it. Especially since it contains memes that even The Muppets did with this movie. This is one of those movies that I didn't find all that great. One must pay attention closely enough to the film to know what is going on because there is that back and forth time line situation going on. No Back to the Future stuff, various groups' stories are going on to where they all lead to one spot in the movie. So don't be playing video games that would distract you from watching the screen. The story lines are easy enough to follow through out the movie. There are some funny parts to it. Overall even though I personally don't care for this movie it is worth watching."

3 June 2004,eskimotshrtsales-1,1,2,10,In my opinion one of the top 10 greatest films ever made,"There are so many different levels on which this film appeals to me, from the refreshingly original conversations, to the characters that are essentially evil but likable. This film revolutionized cinema and redefined what makes a good movie. Everything about it raised the bar on movie making: Plot Structure, Action sequences, Direction, Cinematography, and especially how screenplays will be written (I lovingly refer to every movie made after 1994 as ""Post-Pulp""). If you have not seen the film, you must understand that it contains lots of foul language and graphic violence (this one is rated ""R"" for a reason folks) Unfortunately this wonderful movie has many detractors who complain about the violence. I will admit, the film has its share of graphic material, but none of it occurs without a reason, all of it takes place as a result of another event, none of it is meaningless. Regardless of its adult nature, this film is a classic and deserves a place on every film-lovers shelf. And if you haven't seen it, and feel that you can stomach it, it requires immediate viewing."
16 July 2015,Xkinhe,0,1,10,Masterpiece...,"Twenty years on, Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction has been released in cinemas, and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous, insolent, breathtaking. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of which the N-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the trance- like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer direction-less excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.) Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play Vincent and Jules, a couple of bantering hit men working for Marsellus (Ving Rhames), who is highly protective of his wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match; Marsellus's fighter, Butch (Bruce Willis), is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late father's best friend (a jaw- dropping cameo from Christopher Walken). Everyone's destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists, played by Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth. In 1994, all the talk was of former video-store clerk Tarantino's indifference to traditional culture. That patronized his sophisticated cinephilia, and in fact, 20 years on, the writerly influences of Edward Bunker, Elmore Leonard and Jim Thompson seem very prominent. Don DeLillo began the 90s by warning that the US is the only country in the world with funny violence. Maybe Pulp Fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. Unmissable"
31 December 2013,TPerrone,0,1,9,A really great movie. A must-see one.,"I wasn't sure if I've ever seen Pulp Fiction or not, so yesterday I watched it and discovered that no, I've never seen it before. The movie is longer than the usual movies of todays, almost like the Lord of Ring's ones, but the feelings watching it are totally different. I totally enjoyed every minute of the movie: Tarantino made a masterpiece, a masterpiece of directing, cast and plot. One thing I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it looks like a gangsters movie, but is not. Indeed during the movie the police never appears, neither the word is spoken.This is for sure a must-see movie, one of those ones that you'll always remember in your life and you'll make your child watch it. (In the movies there are violence scenes, but nothing really happens)"

The cast is what drew me to it in the first place, with Samuel L Jackson who is one of my favourite actors and Bruce Willis who is also in my top five, and I believe the biggest tragedy about this movie is that these two fantastic actors did not spend any time together on screen. Other greats (in my opinion) in this film are of course John Travolta and Uma Thurman. I have recently seen Swordfish in which travolta gave an incredibly strong performance as he does in Pulp Fiction, and Uma Thurman who I have admittedly not seen in anything else but also delivers a powerful performance. Leaving the cast aside, the storyline of course is pure genius. Another Tarantino classic with shooting, swearing, quoting from the bible, taking drugs, dancing and Samuel L Jackson shouting a lot, it has all the elements that make a great film."
3 April 2014,TVadic73,0,1,10,Tarantino's MASTERPIECE,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece. It has everything that i'm personally looking for in a film. It's original, violent and hilarious. The performances were excellent. Oftentimes an ensemble ""dream team"" cast falls short on the goal as if just their presence is enough. This movie is an exception. Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta all showed up and SHOWED UP. Each story within the movie held my interest and at the end I wanted to see it again immediately. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies. Tarantino shows mastery of his style and his gift for dialogue is evident throughout. Travolta and Jackson really shine and Travolta's performance rightfully vaulted him back into grade A status in Hollywood. A MUST SEE for movie buffs everywhere. 10 out of 10"
26 August 2004,eddwantsyou,1,2,10,A superb achievement,"Cinema throughout the 80's became boring and cliché. It was one movie you'd already seen after another. Quentin saw this and decided that he would change it. So he started making movies with round characters, environments, and stories. His movies are so rich that you can watch them twice and see completely different movies both times. Pulp Fiction was a work of art. With so many underlying nuances to top off the already 'way better than Hollywood' aspects of the plot Tarantino has showed that movie making is an art, it is storytelling, and it is a worthwhile part of our lives. Everyone must see this movie at least once. And the beauty is that everyone can take something different from it. Can anyone deny that kind of perfected film making? I think not."
7 June 2005,filtros805,0,2,10,"one of the strangest films of all time, and one of the best","Pulp Fiction is the second film by writer/director Quentin Tarantino. The film, wisely, has no real plot: it's all skill and structure. The story involves 2 hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are doing a job, a boxer (Bruce Willis) who is supposed to take a fall on his next fight. The man who told Willis to take a fall is the boss of Travolta and Jackson (he is played by Ving Rhames). Also, Uma Thurman stars as Ving Rhames's wife, who gets involved with Travolta.After reading this, you probably don't think this is a good movie. However, this film alone may have redefined the cinema of the 20th century. It is a complete original, it is ingenious, it was put together flawlessly, and always keeps you entertained. What makes the film an original is the non-linear story-telling screenplay, which tells the parallel stories through time: the first thing the characters did could appear in the middle of the film, instead of the beginning. You could watch the movie over and over again and not know what comes next. The performances were perfect, the actors are perfectly cast, the dialog is great, and Quentin Tarantino's lack of caution while making this film make it one of the best films ever made."
15 June 2004,theone873,1,2,10,"Truly A Masterpiece of a Film, and the True Work of a Master","Pulp Fiction is a film that cannot be described in mere words. To put it simply, Pulp Fiction is a Masterpiece. Had it not gone up against Forrest Gump in the 1994 Oscars, it would have won so many more awards!Pulp Fiction is my all time favorite movie, and I'll tell you why:1. The acting is superb. John Travolta revitalized his career with this single motion picture, and truly made a name for himself as an actor. He once would settle for 40,000 a film, but now commands several million. Samuel L. Jackson was possibly the most intense person in Pulp Fiction, and deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor that was wrongfully given away. His final scene in the movie always sends a chill down my spine whenever I watch it.2. The Screenplay was incredible. Quentin Tarantino and Roger Averys screenplay for Pulp Fiction won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it deserved it. If you watch the movie, you know that it is a long movie (2.5 hours to be exact) but Tarantinos use of dialouge in the movie keeps the action moving, and it also keeps the viewer interested. No part of the movie is slow paced, and the plot twists and subtleties are incredible.3. The Cinematography was terrific. Tarantinos use of the camera in Pulp Fiction was just perfect. As many Tarantino fans know, Tarantino got his start working in a Video Rental store. It was there, that he got the chance to view several different formats of filming, and he was able to combine them in his films to create a feeling of involvement with what happens on the screen.4. And finally, the Music choices were fantastic. For those who have seen Pulp Fiction, you will know about the Guitar Riff at the beginning of the movie that plays during the credits. It is called Misirlou, and was written by Dick Dale and his Del Tones. Misirlou was around 32 years before Pulp Fiction, and will forever be known as ""The Theme From Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino takes old songs and puts them in his films, thereby reintroducing these old songs to a new generation of listeners. Tarantino stamps each of his scenes with a specific song, and the people who watch the movie will associate it with that particular scene.Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films in creation, and it is a true classic. It is my belief that people will come to appreciate it more with age, just like a fine wine."
25 July 2005,boone-greg,0,1,10,Fantastic Film,"Something that has always astounded me is how many people think this movie is the greatest movie in the world, and then so many other people think this is the worst movie ever.This movie is brilliant. It may take a few views to understand the full story, but that is what makes it so great. The movie, in a Tarantino signature technique, progresses like a novel instead of a typical movie. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of all time, brilliantly written, directed, and produced. Amazing acting, particularly on the parts of Sam Jackson and John Travolta, really pulled the whole movie together. Tarantino will go down as one of the greatest directors in history no doubt."
7 October 2014,mynamesniall,0,0,10,hrmghhh better than the best,"This movie is just the best movie there is. Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta Quentin Tarantino and Bruce Willis(back when he was a good actor) enough said!. this movie is hilarious but in such a way that you feel guilty for laughing even though everyone else also finds it funny. if there is one thing i would say about this movie it would be that you must watch it more than once as the first time you watch it(or at least for me) i thought it was just a screenplay of a psychopaths mind with odd random encounters however the second time around there are things you pick up quicker and can link to each other and can fit the story line together making the experience (it really is an experience) just that bit more enjoyable.if you haven't seen it cancel all your plans and put it on, maybe even get a royal with cheese ;)"

21 June 2015,synthstar-88951,0,1,10,Great Fun!,"I had so much fun watching this movie! I don't like Tarantino too much, I think that his fascist movie was not that good, but this one is really funny in it's own peculiar way. It has great story, great dark humor and is not done in the usual Hollywood style, which is good. I wonder if there are really these kind of people in organized crime. Maybe but who knows. Probably not, as this kind of thing probably crushes you too fast. Seeing it on film though like that is refreshing. This movie is not really for small kids but for grownups it is a nice entertainment. If you have nothing else to do, watch it, for sure. You will laugh a lot."
29 May 2014,guy-who-wrote-lost,1,2,9,Completely redefined Modern Cinema..,"I normally don't write reviews for the films that i have seen, but Pulp Fiction was so good that i decided to write one for it. Pulp Fiction, as many critics were compelled to agree, completely redefined Modern American Cinema. Quentin Tarantino's utter brilliance is conveyed most acutely through the conversational dialogue between his offensive characters. The suspension of realism--especially in such absurd situations--is the greatest achievement of this magnificent screenplay. When coupled with the hilarity of dark humor, the conversations of these outrageous characters mold such peculiar occurrences into a believable story. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece shines as a cinematic classic as well as a work of stunning, post-modern literature."
19 September 2006,pacificas,0,3,6,What do you love about it?,"I heard that Tarantino divides his audience, ""but this is the film what everyone likes!""... When my friend told me, that it's a S**t, i knew that it wasn't made for me. I watched it today, enjoyed it a bit, but it was disgusting in many scenes. Travolta was OK, but he was too mimic, with his ""very-cool-guy"" character... And the others too, Bruce Willis always ""acts"" cool-guys, but only because his face looks like that... I like Vhing Rhames, but in this film he had only a few scenes, with only 2 or 3 articulate sentences... But watch it, and decide that you liked it or not, and then when everyone quotes from this, you'll seem to be a ""very-cool-guy"" too... I must say, that the soundtrack was really cool, so it's worth for that."
16 March 2016,pablofreaky,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction - Flawless from Start to Finish,"I have watched a lot of the movies, which are top-ranked on IMDb and I honestly have to say that this is the best movie, not only on the Top 250 IMDb list but the best movie ever. Quentin Tarantino created a masterpiece and is most likely the only writer/director who could bring conversations about Cheeseburgers in other countries, why not to eat bacon and good/bad coffee in a crime movie and make it work. The acting from lead actors Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis is incredible. Thurman's performance is incredibly real and very convincing while Jackson and Travolta deliver the best performances of their career with Jackson creating one of the most memorable characters and monologues in cinema history and Travolta delivering an incredibly well layered and realistic true performance. I have never seen a movie which combines crime, drama and comedy so well. Tarantino created a masterpiece and convinced us that he is the greatest film maker of our generation."
18 July 2005,maxedward,0,1,10,The masterpiece of Pulp Fiction - explained,"Jules, Vince Vega and Butch. A few of the greatest characters to ever hit the screen. All characters in the film are very separate with ideas, motivation and of course personality. Gangsters, Robbers, A Boxer and Confederate rapists and an African American 'Mr. Big'. When you put these kinds of characters together (head to head) the atmosphere is more than explosive. Quentin Tarantino states recently ('Kill Bill' special features) that one of the greatest aspects of a film is when great footage goes great with great music. Pulp Fiction is a perfect example of this. Each song reinforces and brings out a tremendous energy of each scenes particular focus.Each scene in Pulp Fiction presents itself with Morals, whether it's Loyalty, Murder, Manslaughter or helping out one's own enemy. Many scenes present themselves in the format of 'what would you do if you were in this situation?' The unique style of placement of scenes makes the film ever more interesting. It most definitely is a film that crosses many different genres. Thriller, Action, Drama, Romance and film Noir all in one. It may be important to watch several times to understand what you originally perceived.The greatest masterpieces of all time have always been film's one can look back on and give deep thought on. Below there are 3 Categories of what creates that 'look back period' and why Pulp Fiction highly rates-1) Clever Factor: About links from issue to issue- This is shown in Pulp Fiction perhaps more than any film released in the past couple of decades. The film is driven by three main plots and then countless subplots that are interwoven within the main story line. The extreme detail every item is set to from the briefcase numbers to Vince Vega walking in the background at the first scene obviously involve a lot of 'the clever factor'. 2) Quote Factor: Memorable quotes that can be thought about- All that is said is done so in a way that they are new age casual poetic phrases. A closer look will examine the true meaning behind a character's slang statement of interest or a bible passage. 3) Cool Factor: Exhilarating to the mind- No doubt every viewer will appreciate, if not admire the wild and sometimes wacky thoughts varied characters have to offer. Unlike many modern day R rated movies there are few deaths in pulp fiction. But every single death is built up in a way that means a great deal for the audience and at least a character involved.In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a film that can be interpreted many different ways. There are so many fascinating features one could talk all day, but it is up to the individual to seek out his or her own desires within the film. Pulp Fiction is definitely a film of high inspiration but it could be decades before we see another film within the likes of it."
23 December 2007,giladlippa,0,1,10,"To know the facts, you have to see the Fiction!!!","The 2nd feature from Quentin Tarantino proves to be his most worthy. Not because of all the acclaim and the Oscar for best original screenplay it received, but because of it's eccentric dialogue, it's raw, fresh characters, and it's almost impossible to believe non-linear stories that inter-wine during the course of the film. Figured it out yet? Well, if you haven't, this is the world of Pulp Fiction. The film chronicles the lives of 2 petty thieves, a pair of mob hit-men, an aging boxer and a crime-lord's wife as somehow each one of them get caught up in tough, bizarre and comical situations. The way the story plays out with somewhat random events, is truly what makes this film great. This is what makes it feel like real-life and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film is over-the-top stylized and is beautifully shot. The story is amazing, but you must be thinking, what about the cast? With some of the biggest names in the film industry, you will not believe this is an independent flick. The acting is at top notch with witty, funny lines that you will remember for years to come. You cannot ask for much more when watching Pulp Fiction. Everything is just too perfect. 10/10."

11 April 2016,phillipjlindsey,1,2,8,Pulp Fiction is something that stick over 20 years later,"The post-modern film relies heavily on both music and visual style to create something which has ultimately inspired a new generation of filmmakers. It's main strength comes from the character driven monologues and stellar performances of its A-list cast. Pulp Fiction takes on a new dimension upon repeat analysis and evolves with it audience and time period. Give it another watch and your likely to pick up a new interpretation hidden in the existing world of this top-notch film. Unlike Quentin Tarantino most current line of revenge films, Pulp Fiction has a slow and less action oriented pace which gives his witty dialogue more of a stage for the actors to push the boundaries of realism and formalism."

4 April 2017,mitsubishiwarrior,0,0,9,"The perfect, sizzling, non-stop action comedy.","The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence, the extended dialogue riffing overwhelmingly injected with blazing comedy, the trance-like unreality, the karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, and above all else, the sheer directionless excitement that Tarantino conjures, all makes Pulp Fiction just so brilliant.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that it tantalizes the viewer to the nerve endings in your toes – this is made explicit in the Bruce Willis segments of the film which presents a chaotic yet layered balance of brilliance.The Travolta and Jackson segments are sublimely hilarious, with the dialogue delivery from Jackson being so cackling and perfect that you would sprain a rib in amusement, and the acting from Travolta being so endearingly relatable that you follow his character in awe.While it may nag you in the back of your brain that this adrenalin ride lacks a solid communicable basis, I think that is what makes it work in the most respectable manner possible."

The great performances in the film will live on forever. This film will never be matched and the genius of Tarantino indelibly etched into history. I will always be watching for his next great hit because Tarantino always keeps you at the edge of your seat. The engrossing stories he comes up with always keep me excited. I always watch them when they come on and I never get bored. I do not know if I can say that with any other movies."

What is the most interesting thing about this or any other of Tarantino's movies are the dialogues. The small thing that no one would notice are tense in minutes of dialogues.

9 April 2018,wmax-55567,0,1,9,Not as good as I thought it was.,"When I was in the tenth grade, I watched Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction for the first time. A movie that is constantly on a great deal of top ten lists of the greatest films ever made. After I saw the picture, my mind was blown. It was the movie made me pursue filmmaking as a career. The film changed the way I viewed movies, from mindless entertainment to thought-provoking art. I once hailed the film as the best movie ever for a time because of its compelling characters, entertaining script, great themes, and top-notch directing.
However, after seeing earlier films from the Hollywood's Golden Age (Citizen Kane, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and The Apartment, and The Searchers to name a few) and early foreign films (Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress, and The Seventh Seal), I learned those were the films that influenced Tarantino. The older films are also way better than Pulp Fiction. They have more substance over style than this film. If I were to make a top 200 list of the best movies ever, I would not include Tarantino's cult hit. It is just a GOOD movie, NOT amazing. Other films that came around this period in cinematic history like Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Boogie Nights, Unforgiven, and Braveheart are films I would recommend.

31 August 2004,shmakaka6,1,2,10,The passion that drives me forward.,"When I first heard about Pulp Fiction it was from my father who told me that it is a really cool, unique crime film. I was 8 years old and it wasn't that I couldn't see the movie because my parents aren't crazy like that. I didn't come around to see Pulp Fiction until I was 13. I found it on HBO On Demand and decided to rent it because it was something I always wanted to see. I absolutely fell in love, not just with Mia Wallace, the directing, the music, the beauty of three unique stories scattered around to form something that can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Quentin Tarantino immediately went down as my favorite director and a genius. I bought it on DVD VHS the soundtrack, the poster, I'm buying the script signed by all the cast. It is nothing less than a masterpiece. From two hit-man arguing over whether a foot massage or eating a girl out is in the same ballpark, to a mysterious briefcase that shines gold, Pulp Fiction is everything you want in a movie, and more. Never have I seen such a movie that goes deep into the characters and their actions. Pulp Fiction is like the day in the life of a crime bosses' wife, two hit men and a boxer and how it all fits together. Outstanding."

15 November 2014,bati_67,1,2,10,Either you love it or watch it again!,"After almost three hours of watching Pulp Fiction, I can fairly say I did not want the movie to end. So just to give you a quick summary without giving out spoilers: Pulp Fiction is just about entertaining its viewers! This is what all movies should be, if you also consider Tarantinos opinion and this is all what Pulp Fiction is about: Great dialogs, cool scenes, awesome characters, phenomenal camera positioning, some of the best music and so on.It is something different here, you can do the same stuff in other movies, but it works so good in Pulp Fiction that you can not think of other ways to make the movie. Even the slightest scene taken out, would make this masterpiece incomplete.What about the cast? Could you consider other actors to take part in this movie? Tarantino gave Travolta another starting role for Hollywood, who was at the bottom of his success. What is the awesome QT doing, he is giving him a drug addict role and also lets him dance. This is what Jon Travolta is best at and this is what the audience wants to see. We do not want him see doing psychopaths, let him dance! What is Samuel L Jackson doing? Saying Motherf****er or cursing in English. That is what we want to see, we want to see a philosophical, aggressive black man. The audience loves it. Also Uma Thurman could not play a cooler role in Pulp Fiction, some fan theories even say her role in the ninja squad was actually The Bride from Kill Bill.To sum it up, watch it. If you do not like it, watch it till you love it."

He's good enough to make John Travolta pass as a halfway decent actor, keep in mind this guy was in ""Battlefield Earth"". Tarantino brilliantly casted this movie, with a young Uma Thurman and of course Samuel L. Jackson, and although Sam is a great actor to begin with, his performance in Pulp Fiction stands above the rest. I give it a 9 out of 10."

Editing is the joy.,"Very realistic view of underworld inhabited by drugs, perversions and violence.The film if edited chronologically would not have the impact on our view of these characters.  It is the juxtaposition of the past with the future events and visa versa that weaves the story so well, and gives us (the people plunking down the money) the confidence that it was time and money well spent."

True that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose. Words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching. Crime, drama, thriller and a little mystery in a Tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies. The point is that i'm not trying to praise the director in any way, I just think that it's a must to express warm approval or admiration of him. Genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with. GG Tarantino !"

                        ","Overrated, but not worthless","Few movies made in the last five years have inspired such impassioned criticism and intense adulation as Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction. Most viewers either love it or hate it. Only a few folks, like myself, land in the middle ground in their critical view of it.Is Pulp Fiction the best film of the 90's ? Certainly not. Schindler's List, LA Confidential, GoodFellas and Saving Private Ryan should all rank far above it in 90's film retrospective lists it when the decade (as mediocre and uninspired an era of filmmaking as Hollywood has ever seen) is over. All four movies are more coherent and precise in their treatments of their individual subjects. All four pictures are more convincing and all do a better job than Pulp Fiction of balancing their remarkable style with substance.At its best Pulp Fiction is a rollicking, chaotic swirl of color, melodramatic tension and 90's pop iconography. The movie has a wonderfully sharp and stylish look--like a celluloid version of the comic books and cheap novelettes which inspired its story. The editing is brilliant in its quirkiness and unconventionality. The movie jumps from panel to panel with breathtaking intensity, much like a graphic crime novel. The fractured narrative structure of Pulp Fiction keeps the audience off balance: it's a superb touch that allows the movie's narrative twists and turns and visceral images to impact on the viewers.At the same time Pulp Fiction's strengths are also its weaknesses.Too often the movie is ""over-stylized"" and technical. It's like a brilliant film student's dream picture--too cute and ""too cool"" in its inventiveness and technical precision. Tarantino's unabashed tribute to pulp novels and movies can be both a joy and a bother to behold. At times, Tarantino's obviousness and lack of subtlety is grating. The movie's dialogue suffers most from this malaise.Those who praise Pulp Fiction's script as ""brilliant"" ought to run down to their local video store and rent Howard Hawk's The Big Sleep and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Both scripts are everything that Pulp Fiction TRIES (and fails) to be: funny, quirky, cool, subtle and substantial. Indeed, it is a sad commentary on current society that anyone could Pulp Fiction's muddled screenplay ""brilliant"" when placed against masterpieces of screenwriting like The Big Sleep.In writing Pulp Fiction's script Quentin Tarentino tried too hard. The screenplay is loaded with lame modern pop cliches and cutesy cultural references. The overly slick script nearly mars the brilliant acting efforts of Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and others. In light of all of this, the trite theme of redemption that runs through the movie comes across as false and shallow.Nonetheless, Pulp Fiction is still worthwhile viewing. For all of its flaws it succeeds in entertaining the audience. Samuel L. Jackson's performance--a sign of his great talent--alone makes it worth seeing. If viewers take the movie with a grain of salt they should enjoy it. It they want depth or profundity they should look elsewhereRating: 3 out of 5 stars, 81/100."

Original, funny, bloody, disgusting, this film has left everyone shocked. Its incredible and originally written plot is the key of the film's succes, and that's what people like about it. This is a 9 out of 10 movie (you don't have to use the ""10"". You never know what is going to come next)"
6 December 1998,walks,0,0,9,Seen lots of movies.....,Definitely one of my favorite movies.  Quentin Tarantino really showed his brilliance as a film maker with this movie.  The dialog in Pulp Fiction is truly monumental.  What makes the movie so much more exciting to me is the fact of the underlying theme that not many people seem to know. My rating--9
19 January 1999,AIM-7,0,0,10,The greatest,"It seems that Pulp Fiction is one of the most discussed films on The IMDB and the opinions seem to be split totally 50/50 (like with almost every other Tarantino pic out there). But whether you like it or not, whether you hate it or love or whether your a big QT fan or just hate the guy, you have to admit that no film is more 100% sure on becoming a classic later on. In fact, this great rift between movie-goers about this film is one of the things that will make it a timeless classic (whether you like it or not). Personally I think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made, both from a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since I think that Quentin is the best living director/writer in the business. So go out and rent the movie and decide for yourself, if you aren´t squeamish you´ll probably love it."
24 February 1999,Chase-9,0,0,9,Ultimate cool...,"I have never witnessed a more implosive, and explosive performance by an actor, or actress, since De Niro played LaMotta in ""RAGING BULL"". Who am I talking about? Samuel L. Jackson, in the performance of a life time. Along with other wildly visionary, gritty, and hilarious performances by John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames, Pulp Fiction, is as entertaining, as it is original, and that's a lot."

                        ",*YAWN*,"I watched this movie only because of all of the unbelievable press it got, albeit years after it came out (April 1999).All I can say is, why was this movie so praised?First, for all the so-called action, it's boring. The whole endless date scene between Travolta and Thurman? The stupid dance contest? Couldn't wait for it to end. And the ending of the date was just as useless.Then the whole long dragged-out sequence with Bruce Willis...I just kept thinking, who cares? Then the senseless rape sequence. It gets worse!Then the whole *hour* it seems we spend in that diner at the end. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me. The accidental shooting bit was ok at first, but then it too got dragged out and boring. Quentin Tarrantino should never again appear in one of his movies. He, quite succinctly, sucks as an actor (and he ain't much of a director, IMHO. He's the one responsible for keeping the movie moving (heh!) and it dra-a-a-a-ags...)To sum up, this is almost three hours of mostly boring crapola punctuated by a few shootings/interesting events and even fewer really funny moments. On the upside, Samuel Jackson's portrayal of a truly terrifying Bible-quotin' gangster was great...up until his ""epiphany."" He's the only one that deserved an award on this one. I never bought Travolta as a hitman. Thurman is way more sexy in her mind than in fact.All-in-all, an average effort from the Hollywood grist mill, certainly not the earthshattering event it's made out to be. Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has been described as a PF wannabe, but for my money, LS&2SB is 100% more funny and imaginative, the plot is way better and ties up in much more unexpected ways, and is overall a much better film.And I sat down to watch this movie wanting to like it. Oh well..."

The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times."

Forest Gump's Tom Hanks wouldn't have stood a chance ... John Travolta's performance was good but could not beat Samuel L Jackson's portrayal of Jules, the hitman.I liked the scenes being presented asynchronously, giving the sense of people's worlds being connected but they, the characters, not really being aware of the interconnectivity of their lives (roles).The violence in the movie is not gratuitous (hope I'm using this word correctly) ... the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene ... dialogue excellent ... and getting ""medieval on your ass"" will forever be with us ... also ""going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a pliers"" ...What I also liked was the realism of the movie ... I mean no cops around when you need them ... in another movie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here ... just pure unadulterated violence ..."

                        ",It was an important Movie for society and one of clever originality.,"This movie by Quentin was one of excellent originality. Not only did it display the ""other half"" of the gangster image, it was also successful in its acting, and clever in certain scenes that I only notices when watching the special features of the 2 disc DVD. This movie is important because it, in a very clever way, SIMULTANEOUSLY portrays gangsters as invincible and vulnerable, witless people. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta wield 45 magnums like a toy gun, murder a number of people in the process, as if they are truly above the law. On the contrary, they are contradictory to the usual gangsters of the past, like the Godfather or Jimmy Hoffa. In these movies, they are seen as godlike and untouchable; idolized in today's society and envied by many inner city citizens. In Pulp Fiction, we are given another look at this ""untouchable"" image because the two gangsters portrayed here are often sloppy, and occasionally witless. An example is the dismembering of Marvin, the accomplice of Jules and Vincent, which displays Vincent's stupidity. Talking about buying a beer in Paris and hash bars in Amsterdam. Letting Mia Wallace snort 1500 of Choco heroine which, obviously, is not supposed to go into the nose. Not to mention Vincent leaving a silenced on the a counter for Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to find and murder him with. Even Marsellus Wallace (portrayed as an invincible kingpin) is raped by two men.The ""time"" factor. Most people, when watching the movie, did not realize that in the beginning, you can picture John Travolta walking to the bathroom behind Honeybunny, or Jules talking in the background about eating his muffin (this all happens while Pumpkin is talking about the benefits of robbing a restaurant). When watching the movie several times, it is clever how Tarantino manages to separate each scene and split them up at different moments in time, leaving us small clues that allows to pick apart his cleverness. I'll bet you were confused when they shot the two people (in nice black and white suits) and retrieved the briefcase (after the Bruce Willis piece) they arrive at the bar in t-shirts and short shorts. If you noticed, the bar does not open until noon (or 10am?), if I remember correctly. They arrive at the apartment just short of 7:30 am when they murdered Flock of Seagulls, Brett and the ""seinfeld"" guy. Marvin is shot and when they arrive at Jimmy's house, it is about 8:20. They are given less than 40 minutes to clean the car, and dispose of the clothes and the body. When the restaurant is robbed, it is approx. 9:27 as displayed in the kitchen where Pumpkin is seen hollering at Hispanic dishwashers. When you notice this; how it was timed and well planned, it is all the more brilliant.""Pulp Fiction"" also has great irony to it. When they are in the bar, Bruce Willis is done talking to Marsellus Wallace and encounters John travolta. John Travolta Condescends the boxer, referring to him as ""palooka"" and ""punchy"". 2/3 through the movie, John Travolta dies at the hands of? Bruce willis by his own weapon. Another irony linked to this is in the apartment when he survives six shots from a 357 magnum! Vincent Vega blows it off while Jules takes it seriously. The same situation occurs in the apartment when Vincent dies and Jules lives because he quits ""the life"" apparently at the perfect time.Perhaps the most underrated portion of the movie is its music. From Dick Dale and the Del Tones to Kool and the Gang and Al Green, they blend in with the movie. Tarantino did not choose songs that were popular in 1994, but songs that he personally thought did not get credit they deserve. Thanks to excellent editing by Sally Menke, the songs blend into each scene; they do not overpower the scene and distract you from it, but pull you into it, and often have you singing along with it if the song is familiar. Unknown songs are chose and ignored the first time. But when watching this movie again, I appreciated it more because when i really listened to the songs, i found them to be entertainment. The Misirlou at the beginning, in a way, sets the tone of the whole movie. Al green's ""Lets Stay Together"" is now his most famous song; mellow and fits the scene in which it is played. It is the trademark of all Tarantino's movies. When you watch his other movies, I'll guarantee that the opening song will set the mood for the movie. Kill Bill, and Reservoir Dogs are good examples. When I first watched this movie, I was nine years old. I did not have the ability to apply critical thinking to this movie, until i recently bought this movie on a 2 disc DVD. The interweaving of the plots and an excellent cast have immortalized this movie and made it one to study and analyze for years to come."
22 April 2000,Jimmy Jazz,0,0,9,No words can describe how great this film is,"Quentin Tarantino's complete masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"" can't be explained by words, you have to see it for yourself. Perfect acting by Travolta, Samuel L, Walken, Uma and the others. No words to say. And the wonderful dialogues, sharp stories and the nothing but perfect music makes it all come together. And what about Quentin himself? His small but important role as a annoying and messed up little man is beautiful just as it is. And Bruce Willis. And Eric Stoltz in his best role ever.The entire thing might be the best film ever made, at least the best of the 90's. Just like ""A clockwork orange"" it changes the way we, at least I, look at movies. Enough said."

6 March 2001,scurvydog84,0,0,9,`Pop' Fiction,"After Reservoir Dogs was released, Miramax gave Quentin Tarantino carte blanche for his next film.  The studio was well aware of his strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and was ready to back just about any project that Tarantino could put forth..  John Travolta's career had been declining sharply and steadily for the past decade, and Tarantino wanted him to play Vincent. Travolta was cast, and a career was instantly and miraculously resurrected.  Why select Travolta for the lead?  The answer is simple. Quentin Tarantino is fascinated with pop culture, or to be more specific, with pop culture relics.  He is a man who is still in love with all the little things that he loved as an adolescent, and many of these things are found within Pulp Fiction.  The film's well-crafted film noir storyline is flooded with references to 70s cartoons, 50s hipster chic, and the instituted amenities of the middle class.  Even the film's music and casting are retro nostalgia.  Pulp Fiction, is something more than Tarantino's breakthrough film, it is his chance to show the audience and the world all the `cool' things that he's still hanging on to. We first meet the two lead characters, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield in the second scene of the film.  As they begin their workday driving to their `jobsite,' the two wax intellectual on the `little differences' between Europe and the United States.  As Vincent goes on to explain, these differences include European names for McDonald's sandwiches and the availability of beer in movie theatres.  He doesn't address the differences in social norms, political structures, or underlying philosophies of Europe. He is more concerned with the fact that Europeans use mayonnaise instead of ketchup to flavor their fries.  The modern middle-class American cares little about anything outside of his/her immediate realm, and we see the characters of Pulp Fiction in this light.  After the revelation of the `Royale with cheese,' Jules goes on to ask about the names of other sandwiches in Europe, as though this knowledge could possibly have great bearing on his life.  Americans identify themselves by the products they consume, and by finding the European version of these things, it is as if Jules comes to a greater understanding of European culture. In the review for the film on Screenit.com, one reads `didn't everyone think this was set in the 70's, what with the soundtrack, afros, clothes, etc.'  One other item that they neglected to mention is the cast.  John Travolta had not starred in a movie that was a success primarily because of his acting since Urban Cowboy in 1980.  (Granted, Look Who's Talking was a success, but can one truly attribute that to Travolta?)"
4 February 2000,Seano-3,0,0,10,The greatest film experience,"Pulp Fiction truly changed my life. The fragmented presentation of the movie in stories, superb dialogue, the fact that the settings and characters are just so cool, and many other film-making touches makes this movie magnificent. It made me realise actually how much I love movies.The first aspect to take note of when you watch the movie will be when you see the cast. At the time, seeing John Travolta's name acting as the supposed leading role in the film saw the resurgence of his career, and he acted brilliantly. It's the one role he plays where on sometimes forgets it's the famous John Travolta acting.Enthusiasts of other Tarantino films will recognise Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth from his other works, and if one is really sharp, Steve Buscemi and even Christopher Walken. Samuel L. Jackson was to show the world how good an actor he is in this movie. Also, amongst the cast names in the opening credits at the very end after about 12 names comes Bruce Willis. Last, undoubtedly not least. A noticeable touch.The script is of epic proportions. Tarantino and Avary created stories which, especially the last two, can be appreciated in many ways with powerful significance. Dialogue is superb throughout, bringing both astute humour and reality to the picture. The music chosen surely makes the soundtrack one of the best of all time.I love and appreciate literally every shot in the movie. There is only one line in the film I don't like. When Rachel talks back to say, ""Good night, Rachel"" is the only part of the entire film I don't like, and the line fits perfectly with the character, I just hate the character.The more you watch this film, the more one gets out. I've seen it over 50 times and I get something new out of it almost every time. From script interpretations to things one doesn't have a chance to see or hear the first time. It was made so that it would be appreciated for the multiple viewer.There is much more I could add but most has all been said before. I'll end by saying seeing certain movies can bring great personal moments. This movie can be seen as a great asset to the world of film. In my opinion, it's the greatest ever made."
4 December 2004,mynaml12,1,2,10,Great Movie!,"This movie just shows you how great Tarantino is at making films. He blends many cinematic tricks into one great movie and it worked! This movie is serious and funny at the same time which is hard to come by. I give it ten stars.

The supporting actors are just as good.Ving Rhames plays a great role but don't forget about Harvey Keitel as ""the wolf"" great acting. This movie packs a punch, it will be talked about for years to come. It also has a great soundtrack, it has Kool and the Gang! for God sakes!

And I'm very glad that i decided to pick it.I think Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies ever made. It has great acting and a wonderful story. Quentin dose an awesome job directing it and Pulp definitely deserved best picture and in my opinion was the best movie of the 90's.I recommend this movie to everyone...but note there is a lot of swearing it in and a scene in the basement that isn't the best thing to watch. but if you aren't bothered by that go out and rent it NOW!!!!!!
6 September 2001,jokerfest,0,1,10,It's a shame that not everyone can appreciate this movie.,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The subtle details of this move amaze me every time I watch it.  My only problem is getting friends to watch the movie that haven't seen it.  During the whole movie I sit there, ""watch this part!"" as they are talking amongst themselves.  Then at the end of the movie it doesn't make sense to them.This is a great movie and I thank Quentin Tarantino for making it the way he did.  There is nothing about this movie that I would change.I just wish I could make everyone sit down and pay close attention so they also could appreciate this movie the way I and all the other voters do.

11 August 2013,jarmakani99,1,2,10,If only I could rate this 11 stars...,"It was a day like any other. Wake up early morning, eat, school, jack off etc. etc. etc. I would come back home from school, shower, eat then try and find ways to waste time. I would flip through channels like a magazine, or probably treat myself to a snack. The thing that made this day special, was that I was going to watch (IMO) the greatest movie of all time. Before watching this movie, my taste was.... Generic, to say the least. My favorite movie was The A-Team. My taste was horrible. I recently watched Inception, so I was slowly being... Devoured or welcomed (whichever way you see it) into the movie world. After watching THIS piece of art, however, I was just amazed. The acting was amazing. The directing was pitch perfect. And the script... Oh jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, the script left me speechless. I envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. Anyways, fast forward a couple of months later, i already watched; Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Raging Bull, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, Schindler's List, TGTBTU, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, L.A Confidential, Apocalypse Now, Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to 'get IN' movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike.11/10"

                        ",One of my all-time favourites!,"This isn't just any movie! Not one of those simple action movies you can see every day. No this story has been seriously considered and is nice and complicated. I love the flashbacks and different storylines. And what about the cast??? Especially John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson KICK ASS in this movie!!!Look, you musn't be afraid of some foul language or violence, but it isn't overdone (no violence is really shown on the screen) and they are gangsters after all?! And the scene of Uma Thurman being brought back to life may be much discussed, it all fits in the whole picture of the movie.One of the best things about the movie are the dialogues! Can't be compared with your average film. One of my favourites is the one with Travolta and Jackson in the car, about Vince's stay in Europe.With Pulp Fiction Tarantino proves himself to be an excellent filmmaker! Especially with such a low budget. I can't wait for him to make a movie as great as this one.Conclusion: Pulp Fiction is a MUST SEE (cult-)movie, for everyone who's is open for it. And go see it several times, because I still found out new things about the story after seeing it a couple of times. Try to figure out what everything means!!"

And Tarantino was not either, so that magical moment when you realize you're watching a film that everyone else has to see. Well now almost everyone has and it's a crime if you've missed out. So if you are one of the few and haven't seen this yet, get yourself a big bowl of popcorn, dim the lights and immerse yourself in a world of unforgettable quotes and engaging scenes. This is by far my favorite Tarantino film and without it the subsequent plethora of good works wouldn't have been possible. I can't recommend it enough!"

It's not the type of film that you can just throw on at any time, you need to set time aside. But when you decide to make the time to see it again, or for the first time, you are not disappointed. I have watched this at least 17 times, and I have to say it never gets boring in the slightest. If anything, knowing the script by heart just adds to the enjoyment of the film. The cast is all star with the likes of John Travolta, Samual L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, to name a few! All of the actors do a sterling job, and they are all backed up by the most brilliant script and direction by Tarantino, who is a genius. The soundtrack is inspirational, and the whole thing moves along like a roller-coaster ride - pure adrenaline! This has got to be in my personal top ten movies of all time, its that good. If you have never seen it, do yourself a favour and watch it now!"

The way this movie depicts the world of LA crime is like no other ever will, the unique way the stories are told will never be matched.  The way scares the heck out of you so fast, then makes you burst out in laughter is awesome.  The way Tarentino built up the characters, it felt like you knew all them personally.  And finally, the cast, the cast was absolutely perfect for this movie; I mean who else could have played Jules except Samuel L.  In conclusion, see Pulp Fiction, it will be like no other movie you've ever seen, if you are worried about the language, it fits in with the movie so when you think about it, its not really that bad."

The soundtrack is great. The action is amazing, and is definitely some hardcore stuff. A classic movie. Those of you who haven't seen it... SEE IT! It's GREAT! I love the use of surf music and the use of the plot not being in order. Surf music alone is great, but when it's accompanied with robbery and murder, its even better. The first time you watch this movie you will probably sit through it silently. Then you will be compelled to watch it again and laugh your head off. It's secretly a very funny movie. It has a lot of dry, black humor and secret references to his first movie. I also love how all of his movies are secretly interconnected. He is one of my favorite directors and is a great inspiration to my film-making career."

7 December 2007,mux_101,0,2,10,Tarantino Masterpiece,"Like all Tarantino's movies, Pulp Fiction is a Motion Picture Masterpiece. With his trademarked memorable dialogs and pop culture references, it has made a rather simple plot into an intricate piece of artwork. 'The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption', is the basis of the plot, you can't really get any simpler than that.I took no interest in Quentin Tarantino's movies until very recently, and I did not watch them in chronological order. The first of his movies that I watched was the absolutely brilliant Kill Bill Vol. 1, which blew me away! So i started taking an interest in Tarantino's movies. Then I checked Kill Bill Vol. 2 out, that blew me away too! After the 2 Kill Bill's, that is when I decided to watch Pulp Fiction.After watching it, I just sit there in front of the TV in absolute awe and amazement. I was thinking to myself, ""I have just watched probably the best movie ever made!"". This movie is a 100% definite must see. And to all those people who hated Pulp Fiction, you all are brainless and have no taste for good movies. And to all those who have not seen Pulp Fiction yet, you're idiots... Hahaha, Just kidding... If you have not watched it, GO WATCH IT NOW!!"
28 October 2013,eloiseclaessens,1,2,10,A cult film,"« - I love you, Pumpkin. I love you too, Honey Bunny »Pulp Fiction is a cult and timeless film because based on a director with a unique treatment of cinema. Quentin Tarantino has a real talent for turning the violence in derision so that even the dramatic moments are hilarious. Actors (including John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis) play wonderfully and its soundtrack is really great. The fact that the film focuses on the stories of several characters intersect at one time or another is interesting and original. Moreover, the dialogues are memorable and the story is very fascinating. Besides, we can almost say that all scenes are cult (scene cheeseburger, the dance scene, the scene of the cellar...) Finally, I would say it is essential for any movie buff : a head of work."

                        ",Incredible movie,"Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic."

I still see other directors/producers stealing from this movie 12 years after it was released. I still hear people I know dropping quotes such as ""I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?"" No one can deny that it is a cult-classic. Before long, there will be at least one theater in every city playing this movie every Friday night...like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. ""Terrorintino"" peaked when he made this movie and has never been able to recapture this brilliance. I'm glad he has left it as is. The worst thing that he could ever do is ruin it with a sequel (ie: Kill Bill). If there has been a better movie made since this movie, please let me know."

4 August 2006,Malexolson,0,1,10,This is My Favorite Movie!,"I have seen many, many films throughout my life, but never have I seen anything like ""Pulp Fiction."" Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director after Martin Scorsese, after seeing ""Reservoir Dogs,"" I had to check this out. This movie was nominated for a bunch of Academy Awards, and only one for Best Screenplay. Among others are Best Picture, which should have won, Best Director, which also should have won. I don't think John Travolta would have really deserved an Oscar for Best Actor over Tom Hanks for ""Forrest Gump"", but Samuel L. Jackson definitely should have won for Best Supporting actor. He gives his best performance in this film as tough talking religious hit man, and so does Uma Thurman in her Oscar nominated role as Mia Wallace. Bruce Willis, as usual, kicks ass as a boxer that gets in trouble. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer rule as a couple of robbers. Ving Rhames is awesome as Marsellus Wallace, Eric Stoltz is funny as Hell as Lance, Harvey Keitel kicks even more ass as The Wolf, and even Christopher Walken is great as a war veteran who gives Bruce Willis his precious watch.There is something about this movie that has me at the edge of my seat, laughing my ass off, and enjoying it. I have seen this movie many many times, I could probably quote it at every scene. If you have something against this film, I really really cannot see why."

Pulp Fiction is wonderful for all its little details: hamburger, quotes, dance, music......... The actors are quite good. John Travolta is too funny with Samuel L. Jackson: I think this is his best performance. Q.T. in his little part is great, Pulp Fiction is his masterpiece. it's a rude movie, with bad works, violence, and crazy, but it must be one of the best 250 films. my favourite character is Vincent Vega, and my favourite ""story"" is about him and his fellow. Uma and her hair are too unbelievable, and when she dances I laugh because of her serious face. Pulp Fiction is my favourite Quentin's movie"

One can watch this movie 10 times and come away with some new perspectives each and every time. Even the music is totally engrossing. SEE THIS MOVIE!A one time viewing is not enough. It's like an onion. Each viewing peels another level. And each new level reveals insights you didn't notice before. The film strikes deep emotions and introspective tones without being overly intellectual. You never feel like your sitting in a literature class, but nonetheless you find yourself diving deep into the characters.Most remarkably, it does all of this ""Deep Thinking"" while keeping a wonderful sense of humor. It's a real trick to be exploring these engaging powerful (and even violent) characters and yet keep you laughing too!Bottom line, it's like a 10 course meal with all different flavored levels that still manages to keep the watcher wanting more.A modern masterpiece!"

27 September 2006,kaniacz,1,4,10,Masterpiece!,"Gangster's life was always an up-to-date topic. This time Quentin Tarantino created ""Pulp Fiction"", a black comedy with a great piece of action, telling us stories about life of few outlaws. What is really impressing about this film is the cast. On the screen we can see such stars as John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino himself.This film completely differs from the others. Continuity of the plot is unsettled. We move forward and back to the past to see the same history from the point of view of all characters engaged. Excellent soundtrack, with characteristic intro composition creates great background and climate. All the actors perfectly suits to their film characters. Tarantino couldn't choose better! The power of ""Pulp Fiction"" is hidden in the Oscar-winning screenplay, written by Tarantino. Great ironic dialogs, unexpected action changes make the spectator follow the plot without even taking a breath. Quotes taken out from it are used in every day language.Time spent on watching, for sure is not lost time. We can enjoy gags and the extraordinary plot. Not seeing the ""Pulp fiction"" would be just a shame. It's a real masterpiece."
20 August 2001,samersarhan,0,1,10,tarantino is the master of modern day film,"pulp fiction begins with a pitch, and ends with a homerun..... the movie from start to finish is one great roller coaster ride.... it will make you laugh at most with the close to real life dialogue.... the chemistry between the characters in the movie especially john travolta and samuel jackson, john travolta and uma thurman, tim roth and amanda plummer, and bruce willis and maria de medeiros will keep you highly entertained...... at the end of the movie you will only wish it never ended...... the quirky dialogue combined with the fast paced violence is just as good as mixing gin with tonic..... quentin tarantino's style has influenced a legion of film directors throughout the nineties including bryan singer, james mangold, and paul thomas anderson...... he pretty much shaped the decade of movies with 'Pulp fiction', 'reservoir dogs', 'true romance', and 'jackie brown' and popularized independant movies all around...... pulp fiction is the best movie i have ever seen. watching this movie alone is what a real movie-watching experience is all about......... i give it a solid 10 and no competition whatsoever by any other movie.......watch it yourself and you will know what i mean"

                        ",Best of all time!,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."
16 November 2021,filipdylag,0,1,8,Discovery,"I'm not much of a movie-watcher, but I heard of the film and Tarantino before. Nonetheless, I did not expect that. At first, I wasn't sure what is there to praise about it. The story itself, although fun, is still simple. The aesthetic is agreeable - everything from the colour palette to actors, cars, interiors etc., but surely this cannot be the reason for the movie's success? The soundtrack isn't exceptional either, so what's the buzz behind it all?The dialogues. I was a bit confused by them because they seemed unnecessary. Is there a need for a whole scene that focuses on a milkshake? But with time they grew on me, as you probably can tell. They are just so natural, which I found weird to see in a movie, hence the initial confusion. And I'm not saying the dialogues are the only interesting thing about the movie! Everything I mentioned is great, but the dialogues are the thing making Pulp Fiction stand out from other things I've watched.One other thing I liked is the movie's pointlessness. I'll admit I have an easier time finding meaning in books than movies, but even after reading multiple analyses' of Pulp Fiction, I cannot find one meaningful thing. Most of the 'meaning' is just noticing details or themes, but really not much else, and definitely nothing that changes your worldview. Taking into account how the dialogues are constructed - in a realistic, natural way - it makes sense that the story is in the end just a story that could have happened and not much more.I have only one complaint. The over usage of the n-word in this movie is weird. It's not a historical movie, it's not about 'how it was back then' or any of those things. I cannot comprehend why Tarantino decided to repeat it every second phrase, especially for HIS character that HE plays. It's uncomfortable and excessive."

24 May 2014,hoodmatic,1,2,10,One of the best films ever made,"Pulp Fiction is arguably Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. Everything from the writing to the presentation is phenomenal. The characters are enthralling, the soundtrack is amazing, and the movie itself is just incredible from top to bottom. Some would say it's one of the most quotable movies of all time. It's one of those rare films that I can honestly say has no legitimate flaws. I've seen it a thousand times, and it never gets old. Tarantino captured the classic look he was going for, from the visuals of the film, to the sounds and cinematography that you would see from a much older movie. The movie feels very authentic. If you haven't seen it, then I suggest going out right NOW and buying yourself a copy of this masterpiece."

Very Episodic you could start it one night and finish it the other and it would still feel like the flow is natural,"Not only is there a reason this film has gotten so much praise, but the amount of energy and soul put into this classic 90's flick is just great. The casting is almost perfect for their parts. I don't like spoiling movies so I'm just going to leave all of it there. This movie still is kinda of like a roller coaster ride, but one that is somewhat slow and you enjoy the hour that you're on it. Unlike most other movies where the hour is too fast and it feels like its never going to end. The pacing, casting, acting, cinematography is all great. Who knew the genius behind reservoir dogs could still have some good creativity inside of him. I know it sounds like i'm praising too much and everything. You just need to watch it yourself there is a reason why it's a classic"
26 September 2001,basilthefox,0,1,10,My introduction to my favorite film of all time,"I remember when I first got to see Pulp Fiction.  I knew absolutley nothing about this film, i'd not even seen a poster or a review, nor had I seen Resivoir Dogs (although i'd seen posters for Res Dogs all over the place). I can't remember who I watched this film with, but the thing that struck me was the opening scene followed by the opening credits.   They hit me like a brick in the face, with the music (the likes of which i'd never heard in film before),  setting the scene for the fantasic film that was to follow. I was transfixed.Before Pulp Fiction i'd relied on more unintelligable action films to provide me with my film entertainment, films like Terminator 2, Star Wars or Jurassic park, all good films themselves, but all relying on big explosions, special effects and action to bring me entertainment, but it was Pulp Fiction with it's second to none dialogue, brilliant casting and great sound track that finally made me realise that you don't need a bigger explosion, a faster car chase or more arse kicking kung fu fights to make a more exciting or interesting film."
4 September 2014,Kametaro,1,2,10,One of the best films ever,"Tarantino's Pulp fiction was an amazing film. The movie is full of colorful characters, electric dialogue, and so well casted. Every time you watch it, it gets better and better. Each scene in this movie is so well thought out, you will like it every time. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody, its one of my favorite movies. You can watch it over and over again and it will be great every time. The movie is long but entertaining about 2 hours but its definitely worth watching. However the film is filled with swearing and lots of violence. So I wouldn't recommend the film to kids. Some of my favorite scenes in the movie is the Ezekiel 25:17 scene, the restaurant robbing scene, the jackrabbit slims dancing scene, and many more. If you still have doubts about Pulp Fiction, then you should watch it anyway. You might like it."
21 January 2007,nalmahmoud-1,0,1,7,You get what you don't expect,"Almost each scene is a piece of art. You might end up wondering about the whole story line or the learning. However, the tense-surprise each scene brings you is enough to shade your need for whole story. i.e:the ""Ketchup"" joke after Mia saved from death;blowing the head of the man in the car while you expect he's safe;Butch's father watch emotional ""building"" connection:feet massage discussion and connection to killing;tasting the burger as death threat in the air;Butch and Wallace trouble and their deal;Fabienne tears forgetting the watch, ... This is a nice movie that make you comfortable watching with soft thinking."
10 December 2006,ariehs123,1,4,10,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. A far step away from the usual Hollywood templates of linear timeline, good guy always beating the bad guys etc. Tarantino has managed to bring the action ""right to your face"". And the film has so many layers to it (the briefcase, reference to characters in Reservoir Dogs, etc) it became a cult film almost immediately. Also has some great music !!! What I have noticed is that people either love this film (most) or hate it. Some people just don't get the great film making and are distracted by the violence and profanity.I believe it will take many years until another film will bring the originality that Pulp fiction did."

                        ",UNIQUELY CREATED ARTWORK!!!,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a can't miss film. It has everything you could want. Creative plot layout along with actors such as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson is what makes Pulp Fiction great.  Pulp fiction has an un-sequential time line that won't leave you feeling lost.  Basically you have three different stories throughout. You have Two hit men (Travolta and Jackson), Two Crazy robbers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) and a mentally troubled boxer (Bruce Willis). You will laugh, cringe and be amazed during the over dramatic situations these characters come across.  Weird scenes do arise at times but that's Tarentino's style.  Don't let that give you a bad preconceived judgement. I highly recommend this film to anyone over seventeen."

                        ","If Quentin Tarantino was a grill man, then his movie Pulp Fiction would be a `Royal with Cheese!'","The movie depicts three different stories all interconnected by the characters involved. The main characters Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta give memorable performances as Jules and Vincent. They play a couple of hip criminals sent by their boss to retrieve his mysterious briefcase. Through out their adventure the audience is shown that the simplest decisions made have direct and sometimes dire consequences on life.Although the three stories involved are shown out of sequence, Tarantino does an excellent job making the scenes flow together. Unlike the recent film `Memento' where event/time can become confusing the audience in `Pulp' is able to easily follow when a scene is taking us back in time to events that preceded other events already shown. One method used by Tarantino to accomplish this is the classic fade to black at the end of a story followed by an introductory title board before a new story.I especially like the acting in `Pulp Fiction.' Tarantino seems to bring out the best in the actors and actresses, including the very small almost minuscule parts. Christopher Walken appears for only 3 minutes, but gives a brilliant performance in which he talks about what he went through to deliver a watch. You want to laugh and cry for what this poor guy went through to deliver this watch. Then there is Harvey Keitel who doesn't appear till nearly the end of the film, yet is able to make a lasting impression on the audience. He plays the cleaner, sent to assist Travolta and Jackson after an unfortunate mishap. He's cool, clam, and smooth, as he sips his coffee, assess the situation, and saves the day. A few other small parts, but with notable performances are given by Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth, and Eric Stoltz.Yes, we all know Tarantino has a love for violence and it is quite present in `Pulp'. However, it's not nearly as overpowering as one might suspect from a Tarantino film. You don't get the sense that Tarantino set out to shock you with the violence, such as the disturbing `ear' scene in `Reservoir Dogs.'Remember as you watch `Pulp' it's the simple choices that later have big outcomes on the lives of the characters. The type of container you choose to store your drugs, could come back to haunt you. A freak event occurs; do you dismiss it, or re evaluate your chosen profession? Could the next tragic event in your life have been avoided if you had only made the decision to watch `Pulp Fiction?' Don't take the chance, watch it, you may be glad you did."
2 December 2001,ppdebie,0,1,8,Confusing movie about four different storylines intertwined.,"Four different storylines start of not having to do anything with eachother but when the movie ends in all turns out to be obvious why the director chose this setup.

19 January 2022,samsungrifle,0,0,10,One of my favorite movies !,"One of my favorite movies. Tarantino knows how to convey the atmosphere of the criminal world like no one else. A lot of phrases have become winged. Also, it is impossible not to mention just a gorgeous color scheme, the images of characters that are thought out to the smallest detail. There is also one interesting feature in this film. No matter how much you watch it, it will still be interesting. A huge number of small details and references will not let you get bored. The only thing I don't particularly like is a large amount of obscene language, although I understand that there is nowhere without it. I recommend viewing this picture, even if you don't like it, then you will increase the level of your erudition."
19 January 2022,kirillstomahin,0,0,8,Pulp Fiction,"Tarantino's second film after Mad Dogs. And not only chronologically. Unfortunately, he has not removed anything better. (Except that KillBill with a slight stretch).A very long, very unhurried movie. And at the same time very exciting. At that time, it was a movie that was radically different from all cinema. That's really a valiant employee of the rental reviewed everything that can be on the cassettes and began to shoot himself. It turned out very realistic and vital. Corporate identity - long dialogues about trivial things, as if spied, not played. Absurd situations with a huge amount of irony and a kind of humor (but so far not excessive, but very precisely adjusted doses). Again, very realistic. Here are the sanctimonious film critics for you! Here's what you've been sneering at. What was considered an undergenre is now held in high esteem by the film Academy. It's like a mockery: all the topics that are bypassed in the cinema are on display here. Death on the toilet, the family clock hidden ""in the ass"" ...
Many actors pulled out happy."
19 January 2022,belousovvitala,0,0,8,Wonderful soundtrack,"I think I watched it a few times as a kid. But I don't remember anything, except for the names of the director and the main actor (beautiful and bright), and also a great soundtrack, which, however, I couldn't appreciate then, it just sunk into my head.From the views, there was a feeling of a hodgepodge of faces and events associated with crime. Something very poignant and disturbing. The film is one of those that sink in and are not forgotten, but remain alien and incomprehensible to me.I never liked him, but I watched, sometimes in fits and starts. In this film, one of my favorite musical compositions is sharp, hot, exciting, invigorating.As for director Quentin Tarantino, I don't seem to know any of his work anymore. But I saw John Travolta in the movie ""Face Off"", which I liked much more.I can't rate ""Pulp Fiction"" as a five, because I don't want to rewatch it myself, but for those who haven't seen it yet, who like crime dramas with elements of thriller and noir, I'll say that the film, for my taste, is incredibly cool, unforgettable , which certainly will not let you get bored, and will certainly bring a lot of pleasure to connoisseurs."
26 January 2022,krucininapolina,0,0,9,review,"One of the great things about re-watching a movie is catching some of the things you never noticed the first time. There were two little nuggets I found the second time around. 1.) I had no idea Steve Buscemi was in the movie. He had a tiny tiny role as the Buddy Holiday server at the restaurant. Only because I've seen him in so much since then was I able to recognize him in Pulp Fiction. 2.) Samuel L. Jackson was a riot! He was chock full of funny lines and zingers, and even the way he delivered them... priceless.If you haven't seen Pulp Fiction before then it may be a little confusing the first time you watch. I know I was confused. The main characters stay the same throughout the movie but Tarantino jumbles their little individual stories so that the order of the movie isn't chronological. It is no real hindrance to watching the movie it just makes you pay attention more.The movie is good as the IMDb rating will tell you. For my money, the Samuel Jackson scenes were all I needed."
15 February 2015,boersenhai,1,3,10,One of the best films ever,"I love this movie, it is a perfect mixture of crime, joke and wisdoms (Quarterpounder = Royal Cheese).Since today I have seen this film a dozen times. Can't belief that this film is over 20 years old! In my opinion this is the best Tarantino movie.Every time I can recognize new things. I love the para-language from John Travolta and the black humor from Samuel L Jackson.This movie has three different stories (Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace Wife, golden watch and Bonnie situation) with no time chronology. Since today I have no idea what is in the suitcase ;-)."
15 March 2022,mirapgonzo,0,1,10,An almost flawless masterpiece.,"Brilliantly constructed film. It has three interwoven stories about two hit men, a boxer and two robbers in a restaurant. This is Tarantino at his very best and he has never quite come close to the mastery at work here.Pulp Fiction has aged considerably well and nothing really seems dated (not even the huge cellular phones). Bruce Willis, John Travolta and Uma Thurman are the stand outs here and their characters are so unique and well constructed.Tarantino has said that he will only make one more film. I wish, hope and pray that it will be Pulp Fiction 2. I always think about Butch, Marsellus and Jules and where they might be today. Maybe in the sequel, we could catch up with Jules walking the Earth while perhaps Butch has to return to LA to take care of some business.Here's hoping!"
8 July 2022,dragonboiboi,0,0,7,pulp fiction,"One of the most over rated movies ever. This is a good movie don't get me wrong but people chalk it up to be a masterpiece of film and the best thing ever since the wheel, and i don't see eye to eye with those people sure it's cool, sure it's got good dialogue but there's a lot of awkward scenes that go on for to long. And i was not happy with the ending it was bad and not fun but i digress. My one complaint was to be left more impacted then when i came and what i saw was wild and wacky but when i left i feel like i just saw a movie that had all those cool things but not enough things to care about."
16 July 2007,sum-random-person,0,2,10,Girls like me don't just make invitations like this one...,"What can I honestly say about Pulp Fiction that hasn't already been said? The film has basically been hacked to pieces by critics, in essays, by film buffs, or really people in general. The film stands alone as an undisputed masterpiece in motion picture history. A milestone of independent cinema; a film that was initially so smallbut became so big, it redefined the whole meaning of cinema alone. The film is simply remarkable. The eccentric, unforgettably intelligent (lol) dialogue (""A 5 dollar milkshake?""), the cleverly done interwoven plot outline, the eccentric characters (Mia, Butch, Vincent, Honey Bunny, Pumpkin etc.), and the performances along with the direction. I cannot believe that Mia Thurman missed out on her Oscar nomination for Best Actress. She is gives, alone, the greatest performance in this film. In the history of female actors.We don't get a single film like this one every year; or every decade for that matter. Seldom does a film come out and basically change the face of film itself. Pulp Fiction is one of those rare films. A cultural touchstone, this is one of the few films that is considered to be the VERY best (along with classics like Citizen Kane, Shawshank, 2001, The Godfather, American Beauty)...there is nothing like this, and those films. Ever. Period.The only thing, the only single thing, which I didn't like about Pulp Fiction was Jules, played by Samual L Jackson. He just got to me at some points, although he does deliver some of the best dialogue.Go see Pulp Fiction at once. If you ever turn down the opportunity to view it; your missing out on a classic. 10/10...and very much so!-Jeffery Wright (July 17, 2007)."
20 August 2010,hazcole,1,3,10,brilliant brilliant brilliant film from the amazing Quentin Tarrantino,"pulp fiction depicts many different stories relatively unlinked apart from a suspicious briefcase and the infamous gangster Marcellus Wallace. The way in which the film was made and filmed firmly placed the legendary Quentin Tarrantino as a talent to look out for and unsurprisingly his many more films in later years didn't disappoint. such films include inglorious bastards, Jackie brown, sin city and kill bill.pulp fiction begins in your average American diner, where Tim Roth (ringo) and Amanda plummer (honey bunny) are discussing new targets to steal from, after a small conversation they conclude that the diner they are in, should be the subject of armed robbery, and so pulp fiction begins, displaying its violent theme from the offset.throughout the rest of the 2 and a half hour film the audience experiences many Effs and Jeffs, thrills, lots of gun fire and a marmite display of the character 'jimmy' (Quentin tarratino. also there is ever present amazing acting performances from Samuel L Jackson (jules Winnfield) john Travolta (vincent Vega) and Bruce willis (butch Coolidge). Pulp fiction deserved many more Oscars than the one it got for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. its a highly entertaining film which deserves many many watches and will go down in movie making history as a classic.Harry Cole"

21 January 2011,CygnusII,0,1,9,Cream and sugar?,"Mr. Tarantino, in my opinion, summarized the late 80s to the early 90s in all four stories/episodes of his movie, Pulp Fiction. At the start of the first of four stories, the opening scene of the movie get's the audience ready for a fast paced and bumpy ride, though at first, a little confusing storyline for most audiences. This is quickly remedied by the story headers prior the to the start of the rest of the four films.Some people, like my wife found the movie annoying and a little boring, but let's face it, Mr. Tarantinos' style is not for everyone. Yes? A little like soap operas are not for all people either, not a fare observation but, it gets my point across.If your someone who is impatient and dislikes true to life stories, then this movie is most likely not for you, but ya never know! Moving in and around all four of Mr. Tarantinos stories is much like most of his his directing styles, as seen in Kill Bill Trilogy's. So, for me, just about every movie that Mr. Tarantino has directed I have come to love or just outright hate, nothing in between. Much like coffee drinkers I guess, some of them like to add a little creme and sugar with their morning coffee, while other's prefer to taste exactly what it is they are drinking! So, to quote my favorite comic book writer, Stan the man, 'nuff said! Adios."
3 December 2014,ZaneTodd,1,3,10,My Favorite Film,Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Its a must see. I saw it as a little kid and it inspired me to become a film maker. I've been playing with cameras and scripts since i was just 7 years old. A movie that changed my life is one that deserves a 100 stars out of ten. In the film we get a sense of pure comedic and yet serious attitudes. I enjoyed the comedic aspects especially. The gore is also another aspect i love. There's some sort of style that Tarantino adds to the gore which makes it fun to watch. I will never forget this film. Quentin Tarantino is truly a genius.

Buy it or rent it from a store (the best thing is to buy it, so you can see it over, and over, AND over again). You have nothing to loose, except that you'll maybe be stuck infront of the screen alot more!"

                        ",An All Around Brilliant Movie,"Samuel L. Jackson (who is arguably my favorite actor) John Travolta and Uma Thurman star in Pulp Fiction, along with the rest of the top notch cast that is just one of the great qualities about this movie.  I could not be more thrilled that Quentin Tarantino brought back numerous actors from one of my other favorite movies (reservoir dogs) to appear again in Pulp Fiction, i.e. Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and steve buscemi, who is my other favorite actor. This movie is so amazing, that i based my imdb screen name after the restaurant that uma and john go to together.  In fact, my imdb screen name was gonna be marcellus, but that was already taken.  Quentin Tarantino has earned his way to one of my top favorite filmakers, due to his loveable characters, thoughtful plots, and hillarious quotes.  I give Pulp Fiction five out of five stars!"

Many thanks and congratulations to Quentin Tarantino after eleven years. It is a monumental success which will not be forgotten for a hundred years or more. In the language of cinema Pulp Fiction means more than Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in my opinion. Especially Bruce Willis, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are more successful among the stars in a brilliant cast. Of course the main element that creates this delicious meal is the screenplay. The main lesson for this movie is that what you tell is not as important as how you tell. The subject must not necessarily be decent and moral unless you tell it right."

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"Pulp Fiction is a phenomenal movie that can never be watched too many times. With each viewing it somehow manages to reveal something new or interesting. Although Pulp Fiction is a violent movie full of blood, drugs, and sexual content, the script is surprisingly comical. I think that is why so many people come to love this movie. It almost brings together all the genres into one movie (comedy, romance, action, etc.).Quentin Tarantino does a really outstanding job of choosing the actors that could put themselves into the characters shoes. Some people say this was one of Tarantino's best films and I have to agree. Although Tarantino has made many creative films Pulp Fiction, in my eyes, rises above them all. I also really love how he intertwines the four different stories about the two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits and then in the end he brings it all together.When comparing Pulp Fiction to another movie I would compare it to the film Sin City. Sin City also tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption. It also has a very creative plot and story line and the cinematography is outstanding. Both movies are sensational and so different from the normal day to day love story or action film. Both Pulp Fiction and Sin City are excellent to watch and very refreshing if you like artistic movies."
15 December 2008,hrcrazzy,0,2,10,Excellent film for the open minded,"If you love films like Transformers, Harry Potter, LOTR, or movies that follow the typical Hollywood format with a simple plot, tons of CGI, and a moral lesson that leaves you with a nice warm and fuzzy feeling at the end, stay away from Pulp Fiction.But if you're an open minded individual who wouldn't mind seeing every rule in Hollywood broken, you will definitely enjoy the masterpiece that is Pulp Fiction. The acting, dialogue, camera angles, and overall unique directing style is brilliant. And after watching Pulp in DTS surround I have a new appreciation for it. Sure it's violent, tons of foul language.. but so what, this movie is about the lives of evil people. No plot is necessary and nobody wins, it's a completely unique and classic film that deserves it's high rating. So set your Christian morals aside and have fun with this movie."

                        ",This is Another Comedy Purporting to be Drama,"My chief complaint is that this film was incorrectly classified  it should have been classified as a comedy. Why not advise people correctly as to a film's genre so that they don't waste their time with something like this? When I select a film that claims to be a drama I want it to be dramatic which means that it is at the very least SERIOUS! This film is utterly frivolous! This film is so light that if it was thrown into the water it would float, even when filled with concrete. Whoever classified this film as a drama is wasting people's time! The fact that something is a black comedy doesn't mean that it is a drama or necessarily in any way dramatic."

4 April 2011,hendrix92,0,2,10,Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino is my all-time favorite director. I know many people dislike him for his numerous references in his movies, but if it wasn't for his movies or his interviews, I would not have seen as many movies as I have. In my opinion, Tarantino hasn't made a bad movie, even Death Proof, and my personal favorite of his is Pulp Fiction. For one, the writing in Pulp Fiction is absolutely amazing, it's perfect. After the first time I saw it,I knew most of the lines. The acting is great, especially from Sam Jackson, who should have won an Oscar for his amazing performance. The direction is also great, but not Tarantino's best direction, which I think is Inglourious Basterds. Anyway,I don't feel like describing too much of the movie because if you haven't seen it, I would recommend not knowing much about it."

This movie does have potential as a movie channel series, but that is all.  I really liked parts of it, but that hardly constitutes a good movie. I'm not doggin it cause any of the actors, it was crammed full of quality stars, as a matter of fact some of my favorite.  It's not because of the director, ""Jackie Brown"" was a great movie.  It's because it was poorly put together with a bunch of unrelated seines, of which only a few were good.

Pulp Fiction is unmistakably a tour de force. Filled with witty pop-culture references and unrestrained violence, Tarantino delivers a film that never gets boring. It's self-referential nature and non-linear story-line make for endless viewings. It also contains a significant amount of depth, dealing with nihilism and existentialism in the Twentieth century. It's punchy dialog and exciting story render it one of the greatest films of the 90's."

This was an intense film that wouldn't have gotten the recognition it did if it wasn't for the cast. Uma and John... Samuel and John, ah, they were magic and everyone else nailed it. Especially Bruce and Maria. An interesting yet completely believable couple. Amanda Plummer's performance was fantastic.

After I saw this film, I was thoroughly impressed as to how the story was told.  there was no real plot but I think thats a reason why this film is so great.  It was able to tell a story without really having to have a plot.  the Acting is ok...but I've always a screen play person.  This is diffinitely one of the top 5 films of the nineties. Watch and you will not be dissapointed.  I give this a 10/10"
16 June 2003,Jules_Winnfield16,0,1,10,Brilliant!,"This movie was amazing. Now we all know that Tarantino's films are terrific. The story is original and violent. Samuel L. Jackson plays Jules Winnfield, a hitman working for Marcellus ""Big Man"" Wallace (Ving Rhames). His partner is Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta. The both are great actors, and they show that in this movie. Then we have the story about Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis, he plays a boxer who is supposed to go down in the 4th round, he doesn't and kills the other boxer. Then we have the last story, Pumpkin, or Ringo, ( Tim Roth) and Hunny Bunny (Amanda Plummer). They try to rob a restaurant, but face Jules and Vince. All these stories cross eachother. This movie is great in all ways. I give this a 10! Everyone should see it."
2 January 2015,Flying_D,1,2,10,awesome movie,"2015 and still one of the most awesome movies ever seen! This movie is so good to see the absurdity of human existence. Who's right and who's wrong? You will be totally put on the wrong track. How all these separate stories come to life and eventually come together, awesome, especially that piece as she takes a sniff heroin and he put a needle into her chest, great. Delicious dialogues. Is in my top five.Violence in cinema is often a 'guilty pleasure' that leaves us at the same time good to think why this is actually guilty pleasure: we condemn violence, accept it is not good and we know that. But we give ourselves the pleasure of watching because we know that it is fiction. So it has a two-way function: provide entertainment while reflection on our own values."

26 September 2012,king_cookie_mc,0,1,8,"An excellent film, original in unoriginal qualities.","This is obviously a film reviewed and criticised thousands of times due to the popularity of it since release. For a movie created a year before I was born to still be hugely popular and one of the most known films of all time is a great achievement. Tarantino has continually supplied the demand for a shockingly violent, highly exciting and sometimes chronologically backwards movies. With Pulp Fiction though I think after creating a masterpiece like Reservoir Dogs he had to keep a similar theme to maintain his name in cinema, before he could get away with directing Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds which though both brilliant films come into their own story wise. There is also some admittance and speculation that Tarantino is not an 'Original' Director because he is inspired by less known Japanese and other foreign directors but despite this I think he really comes into his own in this film. The only thing that bothers me with this film is how similar it is to Reservoir Dogs, the two year gap between the two films doesn't leave much creative space I'll admit but it almost feels like Tarantino has pressured himself into making a film so similar that it is at the same level as Reservoir Dogs."

11 December 2003,lord_finesse,0,1,10,"Best of movies of all Time, Must see Before you Die","This movie is a masterpeice. The script itself is so well put together and professional. Not to mention the acting, and directing. It just simply doesn't get any better then this. You couldn't improve upon this movie if you wanted it. The true meaning of the briefcase has many possibilities. So many ways to interupt such a film. The acting is supreme by them all, but especially Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and John Travolta. I've seen this movie over a dozen times and still love to watch it as if it was the first time. Except now I know all the words. I rarely ever watch movies multiple times but this is the exception. I've seen this movie more times then any other movie by far.Bottom line is, you'd be a fool not to watch this movie. Unless your sensitive to violence, foul language, incredible acting, gorgeous directing, and all around flawless cinematography. Sad thing is there are so few movies that could stand beside this one, you really begin to realize how bad the movies of today now are. Quentin's best movie yet, even surpassing Resevoir Dogs, so much so he would himself tell you this. By far his favourite, of his movies so hes said."
27 February 2015,ElyasTheGreat,1,2,10,Pulp Fiction - A Masterpiece of Cinema,"It is one of the most important movies of the 1990's if not ever, because it put Quentin Tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for. Pulp Fiction stars Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and many many more and was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Why is Pulp Fiction considered a masterpiece? Because it has really well written dialog – the driving force behind this movie is the dialog, despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has. If you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like Pulp Fiction. From the get going Pulp Fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for – great dialog, a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original. Instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movie's chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way. Half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it. Moreover the characters are awesome as well – Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make this movie, however they are not the only ones who make the movie great.Another thing that works for Pulp Fiction is the soundtrack. After you watch Pulp Fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack CD, because they are all so catchy. The songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie. A dialog based movie? That should be extremely boring, but in this case it is not – great acting, a great premise, great dialog, it even proves that violence can indeed be funny."

20 June 2015,pankaj_pal9,0,1,10,A Tale of POVs,"Amazing story telling, where plot just fits according to need of the director, just to keep us engaged and in suspense. A feat of masterful storytelling. In the end all the seemingly average parts just fit together and produce understanding and joy. I know I'm reviewing this as a book, but this is more of a book and less of a movie. Also the review wants 10 lines to be eligible for submission, talk about compliance artists. I loved the movie, the first half (lets say quarter) is a bit slow but as the story develops you start engaging yourself in this world with people so real they look almost strange. Everyone who acts in it does so exceptionally. Especially our old Nick Fury ""English m@@@@@@@r, do you SPEAK it?"" Do watch it."
2 April 2005,ty10ler,1,3,10,Pure Gold,"This movie is god like. The story, the characters, everything about it is extremely well done. I recommend this film to anyone who loves a great story as well as a little action. Even the way this movie is presented is great. Being that it is four stories, about one story, (well, more like 3 but whos counting). The mystery with the briefcase still has me wondering and guessing. The acting, don't get me started, even the cast, I mean, you cant go wrong with Sam Jackson, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis, not to mention Uma Thurman. This is definitely Quentin's best film.10/10"
2 September 2017,matt-honeysett,0,0,9,Legendary!,"Surely this must be the best film in the word. It never gets boring, however many times you watch it. I first saw this 23 years ago and still enjoy it today. I don't think Tarantino has made a better film and this is probably the most influential film of the 90's. Who cares what was in the briefcase, I'm just happy to watch Vincent and Juels cool their way around L.A. There are so many small details in this film that you never noticed like Steve Buscemi as buddy holly and the film credits its audience with more intelligence than anything that came before it. If you were only ever going to watch one film from the 90's then it should be this as is it re defined the genre and made Tarantino a legend."

I did watched the R rated version but if you can't blood and guts and heaps of swearing wait till it appears on TV as they edit all the bloody parts. Either way you really should enjoy it, one negative I could say about it did go for long then it actually should (154 minutes) plus the conversations did drag on. But anyway it's still a great film."

I think the dialogue is genius and the acting is the best. It was the first movie I ever saw to base how I felt about other movies on. I feel that Quentin Tarontino's style, whether he borrows some ideas from others or not, is impeccable and outstanding. This movie made me interested in film in the first place. It is the only movie I have been able to watch over and over again and still enjoy. I know not everyone appreciates this movie as much as me, but I am really happy that it exists. It means a lot to me. I'm grateful movies like this one have been made. It beats the sh*t out of the Passion."
9 July 2005,irina_opris,0,1,10,awesome,"Without doubt, one of the BEST movies ever made!!! Quentin Tarantino is a genius!!! I honestly think that there is nothing more to do to that movie. I never said anything like this, but the movie is perfect. Awesome dialog, brilliant plot, gifted actors, interesting plot twists...all in the hands of my number one director: Q.Tarantino. I also think Reservoir Dogs was cool too, and i'm pretty sure that Quentin Tarantino would have done a better job than Oliver Stone with Natural Born Killers. I mean, they could have ""squeezed"" more from that idea.(p.s: Woody Harrelson was a smart choice).I agree that Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor, but I don't think he really fitted the character. Also, Robert Downey Jr. was a pretty nice touch(great accent).Coming back to what i was saying, Pulp Fiction is a movie worth seeing at least 5 times...at least 5!"
24 March 2015,jovan-krajevski,0,0,10,Great movie in so many ways,"A movie that is beautifully directed, with a great acting crew, fresh duologue's, that is fun to watch and difficult to understand completely. It is different from many other movies in a lot of ways: from the nonlinear narrative to the unpredictable plot twists, it manages to keep you glued to the TV and is never boring. Quentin Tarantino's fans should definitely see this movie, since it may as well be his best one so far. And if you are not, than maybe this is the movie that will make you one And don't forget to read about all it's different meaning s and hidden messages. :D I won't say nothing more, in order not to reveal same spoilers."
2 May 2004,gpalorge,1,3,10,Quite possibly the best movie ever made,"This movie is astounding. It seamlessly combines all of the elements thats make a movie great and runs with it. QT is a master film maker who uses music more effectively than any other person in the business. The style and flair of the film are unmatched and the overall experience is unforgettable. I hate usually hate John Travolata but this movie made me realize that he is actually capable of creating a movie that is decent. Sam Jacksona and Uma Thurman are amazing and give possibly the best performances of their career. Bruce Willis shocked me the most. Not only did he show that he can play a real person, but he also showed that he can make the role believable and interesting. This movie is simply put the best film of all time."

                        ",Unique,"I got dragged to this film in 1994 by my younger sister, and when I first saw it, I couldn't put the pieces together. My younger sister looks amazingly like Uma Thurman, and when it came to her and the date with Vincent, I just looked at the the screen and pointed and said that I thought she looked just like her, except blonde!! And she was smug enough to tell me that she had heard this from many people! I didn't even know who the heck this actress was. To me, this movie really can't be captured totally at a first viewing. It's kind of a circular film - the first scene is completed by the last scene.I would recommend it for people who don't mind a lot of violence, who LOVE dialogue, and can not take a movie all that seriously.I think it wonderfully cast - John Travolta can still play dumb but smart, Samuel A. Jackson is so intense it's scary, and I loved the handsome Eric Stolz as a drug dealer. In fact, everyone is so good in this little series of different stories that intertwine, that I must say I thought it wonderfully cast, with all the characters very believable.I recently saw it again after many years, and I still say it a very violent movie, a black comedy, and something of an anomaly as far as movies go. It's just cool, what can I say?My boyfriend asked me what part I would like to play if I could have played a part, and I said ""Honeybunny."" And then I said,"" Do you want me to call you ""Pumpkin?"" This isn't a review, it's a comment. I believe this movie to appeal to some, and the rest of you close-minded, uptights that can't take a joke, well, that's your right."
19 November 2004,ESLauman,0,1,10,I saw this movie twice the week it opened.,"On the strength of Reservoir Dogs I watched a couple of Tarantino films in early 94 that lead to my lust to see this one. Never have my expectations been so completely met. This movie is all I talked about for days - or was it weeks? Reservoir Dogs left me with high expectations this movie exceeded. And it wasn't just what happened in the film, it was the dialog and the interaction between the characters. A ""Royale with cheese"" will never be the same again. Nor will I look at a watch the same way, but instead as a potentially uncomfortable hunk of metal. After seeing Pulp Fiction I tracked down everything with Quentin Tarantino's name associated with it, like True Romance and Killing Zoe all the way to Natural Born Killers. Yes 1994 was the year of Tarantino. By the way True Romance and Kalifornia are a couple of movies for you guys that have Brad Pitt as a reason for the ladies to watch, but the movie itself is for the guys ;)TTFN, ESLaumanAlso should win an award for most unrecognizable Steve Buscemi role (Buddy Holly)!"
12 June 2020,morganaham,0,0,9,Quentin Tarantino... 2020 Year review (Pandemic Covid19),"During a lockdown/ Quarantine period what one does do to help pass the time? This is not a review of an all time classic from Quentin Tarantino, but more a reflection of what one does during a time of unrest & uncertainty. Reflection is the term I use because I ask myself from then to right up to now, have we even really moved in terms of a better life or understanding of what is going on today... The way I saw the world then to the world we know now, not much has changed. Being born in the 1970's & watching through the lenses of classics such as this, does have a profound effect on how the world changes around you. To coin the phrase, ""The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same"". A Fairytale has a happy Ending, Science Fiction lets us Wonder, Westerns Make you Ponder, & Cheesy Romantic Comedies make you laugh & cry. Watch this movie again today with what you've learned & know today, does it still feel the same? Or should it even try to."
25 January 2013,joe-cx64,0,1,10,"Brilliant, amazing, top notch.","Most people have seen Pulp Fiction, but for those people who haven't heres why you should...Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride like no other film. QT hit the ground running with his brilliant debut picture Reservoir Dogs, and then shook the world with Pulp. The main reason why i think Pulp Fiction is so good is because of that fact it takes the audience through every emotion. You wouldn't find Pulp Fiction in the comedy section of a store, but it makes you laugh. You wouldn't find this film in the adventure section, but it takes you on one.All the characters are played brilliantly by the cast such as Bruce Willis being actually quite funny (although he showed he had a funny side in the Ocean film) and Vincent and Jules (played by Travola and Jackson) are very funny together and are a great pair.Much like The Usual Suspects and The Shawshank Redemption, this film makes you go ""ohhhhhh"" at the end. When everything links in at the end you get chills up your spine, and you want to watch it again straight away.If you haven't seen this film yet, i urge you too. If you have, stick it back in the DVD player (or video, i wont judge) and enjoy this incredible movie once again 10/10"
27 February 2017,alperrenalbayrak,0,0,9,Great Movie,This is no doubt one of the greatest cinematic achievements. Everything in this movie is perfect. This is not just good Tarantino it is Tarantino at his very best. The dialogue and the cast are all perfect and very memorable. Sam Jackson and John Travolta in this film have the perfect chemistry. They will have you crying in laughter. Of course you still get your Tarantino violence. A must watch film for anyone. A top 10 film of all time.
27 March 2010,NuXta,2,8,2,The title is the clue - it is fictional pulp,"I have read many of the negative reviews of this film here, and I must say that, on the surface of the matter, I agree with a good deal of what is being said.However, I propose that most of these like-minded reviewers have missed the point. They unwittingly give the film (and its self-loving, narcissistic director) too much credit by taking it seriously enough to attempt enough of an analysis to draw out its transparent weaknesses.The title itself is a giveaway as to the significance of this film. Pulp Fiction does not have a purpose beyond appealing to base drives and hormonal imbalances masquerading as emotional responses to meaningless, juvenile drivel that is endowed with flashes of various disturbing imagery. It is really nothing more than a sick slice of hollow experimentation in what too often passes for praiseworthy film-making nowadays. The distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterisation and dramatic depth (or plausibility), the pointless and empty dialogue, the banal pop culture references, and the graphic, overblown, absurd depiction of grotesque acts of rape, sordid violence, drug abuse and superfluous profanity, among other things one could point out – all of which is tauntingly presented as ""a bit of fun"" – only serve to reinforce Tarantino's depraved worldview, hunger for attention, and bloodlust for indulging in cynical exercises in arson that unfortunately pass for artistic merit, in the nihilistic vein of the so-called postmodern ""style"". So much for cinematic realism. Are we supposed to be shocked or impressed by any of this? Do we honestly expect anything better? Tarantino celebrates human excesses, but there is virtually no humanity in most of his work. I would not go so far as to state that his films are unwatchable (I quite enjoyed Jackie Brown), but they are certainly not improving with the passage of time. The present state of life in America, and all over the world, poses a demand for conscious filmmakers and artists to fill the cultural void – to represent conditions as they are experienced. Quentin is incapable of filling that void. He is part of the void.Anyone looking for substance, inspiration, or even just a decent ""art house"" flick, will likely be disappointed by Pulp Fiction. The best thing about this piece of work is by far the soundtrack. The trouble with ratings is that most fans of this film are now, or were teenagers when it was released (including myself), and cannot bring themselves to shake off the hype that came out with it. I will admit I was one of them too, at the tender age of 14. Thankfully, I rapidly grew out of the phase and developed a sense of perspective. I understand that there is a place for films such as this in our society, but it is definitely not anywhere near the top. I place it towards the bottom of the heap. Too many others of my generation have failed to take this step, largely due to their lack of exposure to genuinely great works of art, coupled with confused political misconceptions. As a consequence, they generally don't have much of an eye or a taste for quality, because in a sense, they barely seem to believe in the validity or redeemability of the human condition. A pitiable state of affairs, really – but one whose examination might make for a far more interesting film, if anyone with talent and insight dared to make it. I'm looking at you, Kiarostami."
2 June 2015,koeen23,0,1,7,ain't nothing better than this,"just a second ago I've wrote a review for this movie which contained way too many bad words and that ain't good....nor was it bad. hence, I'm replacing that old one with this one. i was thinking why in the world should i write a review that already got tons of it??? but heck, I'm just gonna do it. i don't have much to say but i'll tell you this: the fact that you are curious enough to check this movie out and even read the reviews (or just simply scrolling) proved that you should just simply watch it. watch it man and you wont regret it. i ain't sorry if you do. cause you wont. it is miraculously good in its own way. the script was on point. the whole cast was on point. everything was on point. don't let what other people said about how it ends bother you cause it shouldn't. in other words, you should watch it, think of nothing else. just sit back and relax. have a nice day my friend(s). and thank you for actually reading this. it sure as hell takes effort to write a bloody review."
6 August 2016,ryancolerc,1,2,9,Quentin Tarantinos' dialogue roller-coaster,"Well, this is definitely a classic. Pulp Fiction I think is one of those movies that has a plot so basic but has dialogue so interesting that you can enjoy it more than most Hollywood blockbusters. (Pulp fiction only had an 8 million dollar budget which makes it even more remarkable). So Pulp Fiction stars Samuel l Jackson and John Travolta, and I would say they are the main characters, as we see them the most, but the plot in this movie is essentially 3 stories about 1 story, so you really make your own mind up. Samuel l Jackson and John Travolta act very well in this movie, they are two hit men with very good dialogue. His role in Pulp Fiction also saved John Travolta's' film career. I think the best part of this movie is definitely the dialogue, as this movie isn't shot perfectly, or acted perfectly by ever actor. But it's the dialogue the characters say that makes this movie great."
3 June 2013,electracomplecs,0,1,9,Tarantino's Masterpiece,"Let me first start by saying that I like Quentin Tarantino's movies. Not all of them (I didn't care too much for ""Death Proof"" and ""Four Rooms"" ) but most.""Pulp Fiction"" is a Quentin Tarantino-directed film that intelligently connects a series of stories, involving two gangsters, a boxer, and a gangster's wife, and how their stories inter-mangle with each other.This is for me Tarantino's masterpiece. The writing is magnificent. I found myself laughing tremendously from the dialog, which is great because I enjoy clever writing.The acting was magnificent. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman were awesome in the movie. Everybody else was awesome as well, especially Bruce Willis. But you have to see it for yourself because I can't describe its awesomeness here.Just be warned that the language is strong, the violence is graphic and some scenes might not be suitable for everybody"
19 December 2004,ComeAsYouAre91,0,1,9,The Wait Was Worth It,"I must admit that I only saw Pulp Fiction two weeks ago, thus making me the last person in America to see it. Whoa, was it worth the wait! I had already seen previous Tarantino films such as Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, vol. 1 and 2. However, in my opinion, Pulp Fiction blows them all away. First of all ,the acting is superb. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta sure make for one hell of a duo. Throw in stars such as Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis and you know you are getting into something good. Like many fans, I love the way Tarantino makes his movies. He is great at having just enough violence and language to get his point across (he doesn't dip to the level of B horror movies). And the way all the separate stories in Pulp Fiction are tied together is just wonderful. On that note, I give Pulp Fiction a nine out of ten. P.S. If anyone has any ideas of other movies I should see (I am only eighteen, still a novice in the movie world), feel free to email me."

7 August 2013,joshy3000,0,0,10,Tarantino at his best,"Standing tall at #4 in IMDb's top 250 movie list, this movie is one of the most memorable movies of all time. With some laugh out loud moments and unforgettable dialog and reward deserving acting. Pulp Fiction is truly Tarantino at his best. The Good:Every conversation in this movie is full of great dialog, interesting and in-depth conversations (even when they talk about foot massages. You could take any line from this move, slap it on a T-shirt, and everyone who has seen this movie would know that quotation is from Pulp Fiction. The movie is full twists and funny sketches throughout the plot. It seems like in every Tarantino movie, the actors are putting on their best performance, and its easy to tell that they are having a blast while filming. Pulp Fiction is acting paradise, which is important in a movie where dialog is the focal point. The Bad: There is not much to go in ""the bad"" section. The movie slows down about half way through the movie, with a meaningless, unintelligent conversation between Butch and Fabinne in a hotel room. However this conversation is only about 10 minutes and is forgivable. What I Wanted to see: Pulp fiction is a very satisfying movie with a lot of re-watch value. However I would have liked to see a bit more interaction between the two hit-men and Marsellus Wallace, it's clear to tell who gives who the orders between them, but I wanted to see a conversation between the three. All in All: Pulp fiction is a great movie, with fantastic dialog, acting and memorable, humorous plot twists. There was really no actor who stole the show in this movie considering every actor killed their role. Pulp Fiction will go down as one of Tarantino's best and as one of the most memorable movies of all time."

6 January 2016,nahuellerena,1,2,10,Masterpice,"Due mostly in part to its groundbreaking direction, cinematography, screen writing, soundtrack, and extraordinary performances (particularly by Thurman, Travolta, and Jackson). Pulp Fiction had an immeasurable impact on both mainstream and independent filmmaking in the 90s. Despite the film's innovation and success. Drawing on the compendium format of Black Mask magazine and Mario Bava's Gothic flick Black Sabbath (1963) as well as the twisty-turny crime literature of Frederick Brown and Charles Willeford, Tarantino wrote Pulp on the European press push for Reservoir Dogs (1991) — hence Vincent Vega (Travolta )'s detailed knowledge of Amsterdam minutiae. As such, the film also boasts a European feel; both in specific incident — the day-in-the-life-of-a-hit-man strand acknowledges the influence of Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai (1967) and the Vincent-Mia's twist has the same spirit as the impromptu dance in Jean-Luc Godard's crime flick Bande A Part (1964) — and in its rather intelligent sense of deconstructing Hollywood history."

5 May 2014,kieronmoore,0,1,10,"'Man, I don't EVEN have an opinion!'","For the record, this is my favourite film of all time.A personal preference of mine in cinema is an emphasis on dialogue rather than action; and Tarantino's masterpiece certainly provides in that field.The in-depth character analysis in this film is impeccable and evident from the get go; the seemingly irrelevant discussion between the characters gives the viewer an insight into the characters and also effectively makes you feel like you know them. Never has a discussion about burgers and foot massages between two eccentric hit men been so entertaining. The dialogue here in this film is so great that by the time the violence comes around, you may not even care for it. This is an essential example of how not everything needs to be 'Michael Bay-ified' to be popular.Another thing that struck me about this film is it's underlying maturity despite the 18 rating. The film is almost devoid of negative stereotypes, for example female characters are portrayed as having power; as well as one of the main and most philosophical characters being a black male alongside his apparent less powerful white colleague. Another mature aspect to this film is the lack of sexual content. Sure, there are a ton of references and innuendos; however no actual sex is ever shown. I feel it's too easy now for films to stay 'interesting' through the use of sex scenes.If you are expecting a run of the mill crime film, then think again! The dialogue is exceptional, the acting is exceptional (despite Tarantino's personal involvement, but that's besides the point), The blend of comedy and violence is exceptional, and the characters are simply iconic.Yet another point, the soundtrack is probably the best you will ever encounter in a film. It fits the mood absolutely perfectly, and whenever you hear a piece of music from this film in the future you will inevitably think of the scene in which it is from."
13 August 2012,mattheiser,1,3,9,Samuel L. Jackson = B.A.M.F.,"It simply does not get more real than Pulp Fiction. The way in which the characters talk to each other is the closer to street reality than 99 out of 100 movies. While the story missed one crucial and necessary scene, (a necessary Travolta/Thurman rendezvous), QT perfectly tied all of the stars together in one magic eight ball of both freedom and confusion. All the while somehow managing to portray each scene with an ease of comfort-ability, as if the actors knew they were gonna to be OK after he yells ""cut"". Cameos galore, each twist and turn brought a new multifaceted array of questions to the viewer, while simultaneously answering the previous doubts with a known face in an unknown life form, languished in the agony of drug addicted L.A. with a Hollywood sense of humor. All the viewer is left with after each scene is, how can any scene be better than that one? And thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's and John Travolta's dynamic and cosmic sense of irony, the film culminates in an orgasm of serotonin laced happiness, Tarantino matching music with motion as only he can do. Drugs, Guns, Sex, and Samuel L. 'Nuff Said. (9/10)"
21 May 2015,andy_2-60-668673,0,0,7,Example of Affirmative Human Nature,"As I type this out in 2015, I cannot help but wonder why Tarantino's widely acclaimed ""Pulp Fiction"" has stuck to my mind to this day. I spared myself two possibilities:1) Pulp Fiction is indeed a masterpiece and sticks to people's minds the way any yummy gummy masterpiece should. 2) Pulp Fiction is overrated, and even riding the hype train from Indianopolis to Columbus engraves its apparent perfection into my helpless mind.I was lucky enough to view the film before exposure to reviews and ratings, and mediocrity had wafted my opinionated mind. Admittedly, the film felt shorter than three hours, but I felt those three hours left no impression at all. But just like any modern Pulp Fiction viewer does, they hop on to the good 'ol WWW in desperate attempt to find that special someone who felt the same way they did about the film, and - surprise surprise - not a single soul to be found. A mere Google search reveals Pulp Fiction's apparent brilliance, with analysis down to the bones and sky-high raves all packed into the idealistic masterpiece search engine first page.But I held my ground. If something is too good to be true, it probably is.Think about this: if a mediocre (and I mean Captain America, Spiderman, gimmicky comedy mediocre) film is torn down to its very core, analysed, and then publicly published as a superb masterpiece, people WILL take a look at the film (in other words, riding the hype train) themselves. They already have unrealistic expectations going in, so no doubt their opinion coming out will deviate from a pure viewing. Any mediocre film (hold your shirts, I am not placing any labels yet) has its strong points; once affirmed and amplified, the film becomes a left-field sensation before the duck gets to quack. Point is, human nature is to fit in and feel secure, and there is no better way of doing this than by adhering to others' views on something which they haven't tasted themselves.However, I give Pulp Fiction credit for its grandeuresque feel that has clearly sparked uneducated reviews by teenage boys looking for sophisticated attention, and outlandish comedic situations which prevent staleness bread and butter."
24 September 2014,Michelle_Lynn_Gastelum,0,0,9,1st introduction,"My first introduction to Quentin Tarantino. I was pleasantly surprised. Roller-coaster of suspense and action! The stories were well written. Phenomenal cast. This was said to be John Travolta's comeback role. He played complete opposite of characters he had portrayed, which was again GREAT casting. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson were great together I had never seen anything like it. The way all the stories related WAS awesome, terrific writing. No movie can compare. Definitely in my Top Ten movies. A MUST WATCH!! A great addition to your DVD collection. When you see Pulp Fiction you will not want any interruptions, non-stop suspenseful action with quick-wit humor and a good soundtrack."
17 October 2016,meydanaki,0,0,8,Masterpiece,"I finally saw this movie after seemingly thousands of years. I actually saw Kill Bill before this movie so I was having high hopes that Quentin would pull of another masterpiece, and my hopes were met. The movie characters were witty and realistic. Some scenes(the gun accidentally going off) were the most hilarious things I have ever seen. Sharp dialogue, clever editing. There just isn't a lot this movie has going against it, besides the fact that there is no real strong story line going for it. But that is where the beauty of the film lies, it just feels like we are actually following these guys around on one of their, most likely, not so better days. Does life itself have a grand story line that we all need to follow out? No, and neither does this movie, making it all the more better. The dialogue is also perfect. The hamburger conversation feels like a conversation you would find me and my friends having on a normal day. The only complaint I have about this film is that the second chapter, with the boxer, seemed a bit out of place with the other two chapters. Maybe if they threw in a bit more of Vincent or Jules into the chapter it would have fit in a bit better. With that minor Quipe aside, Pulp Fiction is a movie that is more than just a movie you need to see, you have to see this film or forever be haunted by the awesome that got away."
27 May 2016,dane-91048,1,2,10,One of the greatest.,"This film should be the Hallmark for films to be seen in film schools. The action scenes are intense, the dialogue is memorable and intelligent with the characters properly fleshed out and believable. Quentin's vision is something to behold as we experience the diced plot through the eyes of Vincent then later Butch then Jules.The film tends to need several viewings to understand the flow so one can find the start and finish of the film. I for one think Pulp Fiction has many genres such as comedy, action, drama, romance and heist which blends them all together seamlessly. The film's outstanding cast do a great job at portraying their characters and luckily for some namely John Travolta, Pulp Fiction brought his career back from the dead. All in all Pulp Fiction will stand the test of time and only gets better with age. It is truly the work of a genius and I for one have learned a great deal from it as a filmmaker."
5 August 2016,Arias74,1,2,10,10/10 Masterpiece,"E X C E L L E N T, I just can not start talking about this wonderful movie, because everything is great in it. First things first: For starters, the cast is excellent, rarely you get that in one film so many good actors give the best of themselves. If you had to single out one, it would be Samuel L. Jackson, with that fierce look, is powerful, enormous. The soundtrack is very good, excelling ""Misirlou,"" the song of the opening credits, go piece of it. The narrative structure is perfect as a ""puzzle"" and divided into chapters, in which all the details fit perfectly due to the painstaking work of Tarantino (there are so many details that many times you see the film you will always find something new). It is probably the film that I enjoyed most, 2 hours and a half of fly by, you keep wanting more. I said, insuperable, unless the own Tarantino was another as good and original as this story occurs."
10 June 2005,sonywega88,0,1,10,To the haters and to the potential viewers,"This movie is not even close to overrated. If anything, it's underrated. I got on here, read all the comments from the people that hated, and almost threw up. If people have the balls to even say such horrible things as they did in their comments, they've mostly been abusing free speech. This movie has redefined the way people watch movies. A lot of thriller movies try to be like this one; they have borrowed ideas and what not, and have not come close. Tarantino is very original and came up with these ideas himself. No one else even dreamed of making a movie like this. Though there are some odd scenes, the movie itself is very interesting and very nicely paced. If you don't like this movie, then just stop watching movies all together because almost every movie out there after 94 borrowed stuff from this one."
6 July 2016,simonwantsmoore,1,2,10,One of the greatest movies of all times,"Tarantino goes out on a limb with many unusual stylistic choices, including the chronological variances that confused some audience members; I know because I heard them muttering during screenings. However, Tarantino makes it all hold together impeccably. The film is confusing if you sit back and try to cruise through it; you will have to think at times to keep it together, but with a modicum of intellect, it'll all make perfect sense and will automatically belong in your favorite films of all times lists. I also really liked the work from Uma Thurman. I think she doesn't receive a lot of credit as an actress because she has something of a bimbo model look to her, but she actually can perform well, and she does a great job here as Mia Wallace. Thurman manages to convey a wide variety of attitudes and emotions in the role and has never been better."
1 May 2015,jamiepearson1996,0,0,10,A Masterpiece,"The film that perpetuated Tarantino to an icon in the history of cinema is without question this one. Pulp fiction is written in such a way that even though it isn't filled with wall-to-wall action it glues the audiences' eyes on the screen from beginning to end thanks to it's snapping, self-referential dialogue, layered engaging characters and at the time revolutionary form of storytelling. The film focuses around several plot lines all of which somewhat connected in their own Shakespearian way, and of course the mysterious contents of the briefcase. Another strong feature in the film is the stellar performances from Jon Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman (all of which were nominated for academy awards as a result) who brought their A-game to the set, each delivering famous, ultra-quotable phrases throughout the film. Yes Pulp fiction is a timeless classic that will live on throughout film history."
31 July 2015,m-golshani32,0,1,10,pulp fiction review,"Twenty years on, Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction has been rereleased in cinemas, and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous, insolent, breathtaking. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of which the N-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.) Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play Vincent and Jules, a couple of bantering hit men working for Marsellus (Ving Rhames), who is highly protective of his wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match; Marsellus's fighter, Butch (Bruce Willis), is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late father's best friend (a jaw-dropping cameo from Christopher Walken). Everyone's destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick- up artists, played by Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth. In 1994, all the talk was of former video-store clerk Tarantino's indifference to traditional culture. That patronised his sophisticated cinephilia, and in fact, 20 years on, the writerly influences of Edward Bunker, Elmore Leonard and Jim Thompson seem very prominent. Don DeLillo began the 90s by warning that the US is the only country in the world with funny violence. Maybe Pulp Fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. Unmissable"

An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time.

Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie.

25 August 2016,chacalhu-67159,1,2,9,Pulp Fiction,"It is very difficult to talk about Pulp Fiction dispassionately. The film was one of the most impactful of the 90s and created - and still creates - a number of direct and indirect quotes in movies, series and conversations on our day-to-day. Even those who do not like the film, and there is no sin in it, have to at least recognize the pop phenomenon that the second work directed by Quentin Tarantino generated.The main feature of the film is its non-linear narrative. Many will say that it was not Quentin Tarantino who created this form to assemble and tell a story (or several), but he never said it was. There are undeniable classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon and Annie Hall who ventured down this path, with undeniable success. Even the very Tarantino, discreet and cleverly, had tried to embrace this technique in Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut enviable.It turns out that what Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction was, on the one hand, to popularize this form of narrative and on the other, make it almost in its own narrative, giving the ""Tarantino touch"" it. Proof of popularization of non-linear narrative is the amount of films that followed this trend throughout the 90s and 2000s, culminating in perhaps amnesia and City of God.About transform non-linear narrative into something her, this is one of the most misunderstood features of Tarantino. The director is accused of copycat, copycat and all kind of synonym for this, as if no other director to do the same or as if the own Tarantino had not already stated that copies but works like. But what the director can do is to turn all copy or borrow something in itself. We know that we are watching a Tarantino movie even though we presented the work by the middle. The same can be said for directors like Woody Allen and Steven Spielberg. If this is something good or bad, it is not here to judge. What is clear is that Tarantino knows to take what is apparently commonplace and make something with your signature and that's what he did with the non-linear narrative in Pulp Fiction became the basics in a structure that unfolds in several stories parallel and sometimes tangential, that at the end, make it evident the domain that the director has on the camera and on the assembly, besides the always present and always perfect soundtrack.See, for example, the temporal leap Tarantino is in the middle of the film, when we see the little Butch (the character played by Bruce Willis) receiving a visit from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. All this scene, which tells a story with one long monologue Koons in a single plane-sequence, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of Butch's father's watch. This already happens in the middle of the narrative intersected Tarantino imposes, but when the flashback happens, we accept naturally, without awkwardness or without for a moment fail to understand what is happening. Today, we find that something obvious and unimaginative, but try to be transported to 1994, when Tarantino Pulp Fiction launched in Cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for several minutes. Nobody before had built a movie like this, at least not consistently and telling several stories at the same time. And here, of course, fit the applause due to wistful Sally Menke's favorite automaker director and perhaps most responsible for the actual genesis of ""tarantinesca identity."""

19 July 2005,ja30fitz,0,1,10,A Masterpiece!,"This is an incredible example of classic American film. Quentin Tarantino has created one of the most iconic films in American film history. Considered by many to be the breakout film for Samuel L. Jackson, Jackson is great in his role, and his Oscar nomination for this role was appropriate. John Travolta's comeback role as Barbarino-esquire Vincent Vega is also incredible, and his conversation with Eric Stoltz's character about defacing a car is a gem. Uma Thurman is incredible, and her character is the highlight of this movie, not to mention a GREAT scene with Travolta in a 50's style restaurant! Rosanna Arquette, Harvey Keitel, and especially Christopher Walken are not to be missed in their supporting roles which add further to this movie's INCREDIBLE acting. The script is great, too, probably one of the best ever. The film is ripe with violence and cursing, but if you can get by that, this film is not to be missed!"
20 February 2005,thekennedead,1,3,10,Favorite Movie of All Time,"Pulp Fiction is one of those rare great movies that if you closely follow the dialog you can appreciate it for what it really is, a fantastic movie with an ingenious dialog. With movies such as this where the film was directed and wrote (technincally co-wrote) by one man, it is bound to be compared to his/her other movies. Quentin Tarantino has both director and wrote 4 other movies (excluding My Best Friend's Birthday) and they are all fantastic, however this is in my opinion by far the best. Combined with a unique fantastic screenplay, great acting by all roles (expecially Samuel L. Jackson), and a creative intertwining of three different stories, makes Pulp Fiction a fantastic movie that is without a doubt my favorite of all time. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie."
21 October 2016,kevlard,0,0,10,My favorite movie of all time,"Pulp Fiction is a classic directed by the influential filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. He blew me away with this movie. The script is written beautifully as the dialogue between the characters is so enticing you cant take your eyes off the screen. The performances are of course, great. Samuel L. Jackson knocks it out of the park as Julez Winfield. The non-linear story telling take you from one story to the other and it works so well. This is a movie driven by dialogue and its so good thanks to Tarantino. If you were to watch another movie that's dialogue driven it doesn't compare Pulp Fiction in any way. Superb movie and one that will go down in cinema history."

I admire the directing style of Tarantino who puts him top film makers. His ability is unique and makes him distinguished in directing. Acting by whole crew is superb. Live dialogs maintain continuity in audience interest. Transitions between seemingly disconnected stories are exceptionally thought and relayed. No matter how many times you have seen, without any appetite, you would like to see again and again. From the very first conversations to the final scene where Travolta and Samuel leave the restaurant with haste confidence and bullying accompanied with a tonic music is still what makes an ordinary viewer attached to the story.

24 March 2018,Eckleburg,0,0,10,Talent & Chemistry on Screen,"Pulp Fiction is one of the first movies that struck me as truly special. There was nothing that bore much resemblance to it upon first viewing and still nothing to this day that brings forth the same character and swag that Tarantino & his crew managed to pull off here. What is more impressive is that the story is quite generic; what makes the movie such an enjoyable watch are the performances and the dialogue. This is an ode to Tarantino films in general as I went on to discover by watching more of his works later on. Even still, it should be said that the cast and screenplay drive this one home like few others do. Another feat that makes Pulp Fiction stand out would be Tarantino's keen ear for music that fits so well with his screenplays. Whenever I hear ""Misiriou"" or ""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon"", I have the opening credits or Uma Thurman dancing in my mind's eye. The same can be said for ""Son of a Preacher Man"" & others. It's truly an experience that stays with you.Quite simply put: it's a classic. Pulp Fiction captures a feeling more than it does a compelling story through the creative lenses of Tarantino and a cast that just gelled together so well. It's as good as a royale with cheese sounds."

Pulp Fiction, set in the early 1990's, skillfully blends the stories of Jules and Vincent(Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta), a pair of wise-cracking hit-men and their stash of unidentified merchandise, Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames),the criminal kingpin they work for, his cocaine-snorting wife, Mia Wallace(Uma Thurman) and Butch Coolidge(Bruce Willis), a cold-hearted prizefighter. The chaos and fun starts when the odd lives of all these characters cross. The movie is great in all ways. Tarantino is in my opinion one of the greatest directors of all time, and he shows his passion in every scene in Pulp Fiction. The screenplay, created by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary is extremely well written and the way the movie mixes it's scenes is just fantastic. It is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a thousand times and still not be able to remember what comes next. The surf-rockish theme song by Tribal Thunder fits the movie perfectly. Many speak of memorable scenes and memorable lines from certain films, but every scene, every character and nearly every line in this film has become iconic.As much as I would like to recommend this movie to all viewers, I have to warn you that this movie is pretty violent. It includes some strong drug scenes, a very graphic rape scene and there are as well a couple of murders, so it's not really a movie to watch with your family on a Friday night. Otherwise, if you're a Tarantino fan or like violent, wicked and dark comedies, this is the movie for you and I strongly recommend it."

17 February 2006,jrbilliken034,0,2,10,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen.,"This is possibly one of THE greatest movies I have ever seen. Its awesome plot and amazing lineup of actors makes this a must see for anyone. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make a great pair and their chemistry on screen is great. Bruce Willis delivers beautifully and knows how to keep it real. Like I said earlier, the plot is unbelievable and its changes in chronology and flashbacks to things unseen earlier, make it fun to watch. And in the end, all the pieces fall into place for a perfect finish. As for the action, I cannot explain the rush you feel when you watch Willis, Travolta, and Jackson in action. Once again, this movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys plot twists, gangsters, and action."
7 August 2017,Albert-Herrera,0,0,9,A Pure Classic,"As a fan of director Quentin Tarantino's work (his second film at the time), I made this picture a must see and I found it to be brilliant, entertaining, thought provoking (of pop culture) and captivating. Just the dialogue alone is funny and quite entertaining and would be hard, after the 2.5hrs, to walk away without some quotes to use. If you have not yet seen this picture, rent it and watch it."

11 February 2018,Plazmodij,1,2,10,Fun movie,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."

At first, I almost lost myself, the second was getting the puzzles together & the third was remembering great humor lines, the cinematography, the story, actors portraying there role, Rose up John Travolta's career, Samuel L. Jackson, & Uma Thurman to rise on top along actor, screenwriter & Director Quentin Tarantino who's another Clint Eastwood man to never stop.himself or give up on a project. Still worth watching everyday!!"

                        ",Best ever,Best film you will ever watch some of the other folks on here just go on and on just watch it you won't be let down that's all ya have to do
29 November 2005,soxfan6978,0,3,10,Best film of the 90's,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. They're as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (""The car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. She's the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. That's before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, ""YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D.to YOUR house, I'LL stick in the needle!"" Bruce Willis and Maria Medeiros play another couple: He's a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. She's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control.If the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. A lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: The characters say only enough to advance the plot. But the people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. It also means that the characters don't all sound the same: Travolta is laconic, Jackson is exact, Plummer and Roth are dopey lovebirds, Keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, Thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas."

A must see movie with multiple award, Pulp Fiction is a dramatic crime movie with many humorous scenes known for its many iconic scenes and well known faces that anyone would know of regardless of age.
The movie begins in the city of Los Angeles at a small diner joint called Hawthorne's Grill, a couple having a nice breakfast in the morning soon turns sour when the couple decides to rob the breakfast joint. The scene soon fades out and another scene comes up, two hit men are having small discussions with each other about various things such as the name of foods and suddenly changing the topic to when is it ok to murder someone they even discuss about the legality of drugs in other parts of the world . A few more scenes are shown to us after these first two, a lady surviving a near death experience, two dudes pulling up to a bar in only t-shirts and boxer shorts, a boxer on the run after breaking a deal, and even a man waking up to a car pulled up with blood all over and, all of these moments manage to link together like cogs being turn.
Quentin Tarantino's use of different of multiple points of view and tying everything together at the end a step at a time helps movie watchers finally know the whole story of the movie while keeping them in the dark as to why the movie plays out with different moments with no certain order. Despite how well the scenes were done and played by the actors, the little amount of development of the characters and the missed opportunities of the scenes shows that the movie is lacking although I still enjoyed it for many other things.
Tarantino's choice of actors to fulfill the portrayal of characters in the movie like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta as the two hit men Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, Tarantino is able to utilize their acting ability to their full potential that one of their scenes becomes a very memorable moment in movie history that the scene is used on many things outside of the movie genre like shirts, posters and even memes. I've seen many shirts that combined the members of the band Daft Punk replacing Vincent and Jules as they hold up their pistols as they were about to fire, even recently a meme became popular that was a reference to Samuel L. Jackson scene as he is about to see Quentin Tarantino's character, he says; ""S**t N***o, that's all you had to say. Speaking of characters I find it enjoyable when movie producers include themselves in the movie either as primary or secondary roles, or even cameos like Stan Lee's many cameos in his own movies like in his most recent movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, leaves me satisfied. Seeing Tarantino have a role in his own movie tells me I will like the movie a lot. If there is something I find lacking for the movie would be the amount of time characters have, I really like seeing character development in a movie and although the acting in Pulp Fiction was amazing I was sad that I wouldn't see anymore of the character or what will happen to the character at the end of the movie.
Another key strength of the movie would be music and editing, the music used in certain parts of the film plays a big part in the movie, the scene with Vincent and Jules at the apartment goes very well with the moment that people are remembered of this scene from the movie when they hear it from somewhere else that isn't they movie, the music also goes well with dance scenes, the one scene where Travolta's character and Uma Thurman's character begin dancing I think the music had a part in making the now iconic dance scene very noteworthy and well known, music plays a more supportive role in movies because it can manipulate the emotion of the audience. The editing of the movie is another supportive part of movies, although the editing wasn't realistic, the cheesiness of the editing can give the movie humorous moments, like when the gun was fired and the car was splattered with blood, combine this and the panicking of both Vincent and Jules you can get a pretty funny scene from the movie. One thing I wish the movie included were extra scenes that explained some moments in the movie that left me wanting answers like the many scenes with the suitcase, I will never know what was inside the case unless I searched it online of watch a video and honestly I wouldn't want to do that to myself.
Pulp fiction is a movie you definitely want to watch when you are old enough since the movie is rated R and even if you do watch it at a younger age you may not get the humor of Tarantino. After watching this movie you will get the many references to the movie whether you see them on the internet, on shirts or if you're just walking through the store because this movie will be marked as one of the best movies of its time and I think it is deserving of its many awards."

                        ",THE BEST,"Pulp-Fiction is an unreal movie; an all-star cast with a new unique type of writing. One of the best scences in the movie is the second scene of the movie. Where, John Travolta is talking to Samuel L. Jackson in the car about what they call different burgers in fast food resteraunts in Europe. I thought that was hilarious and a classic. People might of thought the swearing was heavy, but I thought it added a sort of... real tense to the movie. The acting was the best you will see in a while. The performaces by Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Vingh Rahmes, and Bruce Willis were fantastic. After seeing this movie I knew why it was nominated for Academy Awards including Best Picture. I think Mr. Tarentino introduced a new type of movie, that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. I hope he continues to write movies like this one. It was funny, scary, dramatic, and in its own way romantic. If I were a real critic and my say mattered, I would unanomously make this my favorite movie of all time. I recommended this movie to anyone who is looking for a movie to watch for a fun time."
15 April 1999,Elliot R,0,0,9,A true masterpiece.,"Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of the decade and a testament to the genius of Quentin Tarantino. Building on the success of his debut, Resevoir Dogs, Tarantino delivers a superbly-scripted, masterfully-directed, crime epic. Three stories (created by Tarantino and Roger Avery) are intertwined through the film and it unfolds, much like Reservoir Dogs, out of chronological order. The film was criticised by many as being too violent, although by modern standards I think it is rather tame. The violent scenes are directed and acted so well, however, that they stick in the viewer's mind long after watching the movie. I am convinced that there is a spiritual level to the movie and the theme of redemption is a very strong one; the film finishes with Jules's decision to leave the violent lifestyle, although this decision is not chronologically at the end of the story. And the mysterious bright glow from Marcellus's briefcase will certainly leave you wondering about unearthly elements in the film. A strong cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis, certifies this film as a true classic."
11 November 1998,Jota-2,0,0,10,How we love to let ourselves go wild...,"Yeah, must admit. This is my fav movie of all times. If Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" was amazingly shocking, this time is maturely shocking. It is just that way Tarantino drives the audience that leaves me thinking. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman just rule. The scene where the last two dance at the Jack Rabitt Slim is one of the most simple and yet beautiful dance scenes in time. So does the restaurant scene with Honey Bunny and Pumpkin...it's a total standout, it's that way that Samuel Jackson treats the situation...Really a blow-out, a must see. All over the movie, the audience keep thinking on what if...? What if I shoot right here, right now? Yeah, what? It's just the way Tarantino plays with the wild emotions hiding into ourselves...He just blows people's minds! With this movie, Tarantino has to be accepted as tha master he is, both directing and writing."
24 November 1998,Capeside,0,0,9,Black Comedy at its Best,"This is definitely a film that has to be viewed at least twice. Once to see it and again to understand it. The editing makes it a very hard film to follow, but those that stay the course are in for a treat. Despite the profanity and graphic violence, it is, deep down a comedy. The entire cast is excellent, but it's Travolta and Jackson, as the two philosophical hit men that really make this a great movie. In a way this film is a lot like "" Airplane"", the more you see it the more of the subtle comedy you pick out."

                        ",10 out of 10 for Entertainment,"Is this the greatest movie of all time?   Probably not, but it is a GREAT movie. I have seen a lot of comments about the film's morality, but a film should first of all entertain.What I hate about a movie is if it is too predictable you know what is going to happen after 15 minutes or I feel cheated if the plot is too convoluted purely to confuse me. Pulp Fiction does neither of these but just gives you enough changes of pace to keep you guessing how the stories are going to come together.   And how they do!  When you see Vincent and Jules at the diner for the last scene you just KNOW what's going to happen next but Tarantino keeps us dangling with some really funny dialogue about bacon when all  we're waiting for is the inevitable confrontation.This film is a collection of classic scenes and funny one-liners (the adrenalin-shot scene has to be my favourite).  To look at whether this is a moralistic film is the wrong way to look at it.  It's never going to be as uplifting as, say, The Shawshank Redemption, but it never pretends to that kind of film. But it does have depth. After you watch it more than once you start to think of the ""What If's""Probably the most profound is the mix of Faith in God versus Faith in Superstition.  When Jules says that he felt the touch of God, was this a true warning to him and would HE have been shot instead of Vincent if he hadn't changed his ways.  Or was God trying to save Pumpkin and Honey Bunny through Jules?  Or was Vincent the one that God was trying to warn but he didn't feel the touch of God and so lost his life and possibly his soul to the Devil.  The briefcase's combination is '666' so there is definite imagery of Hell here.And Butch has Faith in Superstition with the dubious history of the lucky watch. What if he never went back for the watch?  Would he have ever escaped the hitmen looking for him?  And was it the fact that he had just put the lucky watch on that helped him get the better of Vincent?  And what seems like a really unlucky encounter when he runs down Marcellus and then gets taken hostage by the shopkeeper actually gives him probably the only chance to wipe the slate clean by saving Marcellus himself.  So if the watch really was lucky, what more luck could you ask for??A great movie and 10 out of 10 for entertainment (and not just the first time you watch it - tho that was the best for all the surprises)."

                        ",Over the Hill?,"When I saw Pulp Fiction 4 years ago, I have to say I was busting out laughing with everyone else in the audience. The vibrant dialogue, the intertwined storylines and unexpected plot twists took me by surprise. I took my girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) to see Pulp Fiction a few weeks later, and she didn't laugh at any of the funny parts, and definitely took exception to the violence. Of course we got in a big fight over the whole thing in the car ride home. I couldn't believe that anyone with half a liver and a thyroid as their only major organs, could not see the brilliance that Tarrantino had crafted.I watched Pulp Fiction for again since the last time I saw it with my ex, and you know what? I really didn't like it as much. Now much can be said about this reaction. Maybe my ears and eyes began to bleed with the post-Tarrantino melee of knock off culture that ensued after Pulp Fiction. Things that were already cool for twenty years, like Dick Dale, or Kool and the Gang got incessantly beat into our heads as ""the new hip thing"". Fine, maybe I harbor a little resentment for how the mainstream will eventually water down anything that has any artistic merit. I think I even saw a butter commercial that used that ""Pulp Fiction"" font as title cards. Gimme a break.Back to the main point. Is Pulp Fiction a great movie? No. Is it good movie because it is entertaining? Yes. Is it an important movie? No. Do I think it isn't an entertaining movie because of the violence and profanity? Quite the contrary, I don't think that has anything to do with whether or not this movie is great or not. Pulp Fiction like myself, is a compost heap of pop-culture references. The Simpsons are a full of pop culture references yet considered great. Shakespeare is full of pop-culture references, but no one gives his work flak just because you have to open the OED to get half of it. I think too many people spend too much time dwelling on these obvious manifestations. I think the real reason Pulp Fiction is not great, is because it does nothing to create characters who are metaphoric in any sense. They are there to serve very one dimensional purposes on the screen. People praise Pulp Fiction for it's structural elements, but for my money Reservoir Dogs or a movie like Short Cuts did a better job of playing with narrative style. This brings me to Reservoir Dogs, which I think is a great and important movie because it did alter the narrative telling in a totally different way. Though much of the story element is ripped off from a similar chinese movie about twelves thieves with an informer and a heist gone bad(I can't remember the name of it), Tarrantino tells the story differently than any filmmaker has told before. Not only is the story non-linear, but if broken down into it's treatment of time, it looks like someone took a script chopped up into pieces, and then taped it back together randomly. Miraculously it all works. He also tells the story like a drama for the stage, with long extended dialogue sequences, but yet he manages to not get that ""why did they even bother putting on this film, because it looks exactly like a play"" look. (In the Company of Men, Oleanna) Reservoir Dogs has all the violence and profanity of Pulp Fiction, but it also has depth to it's characters.Tarrantino is a well educated filmmaker, in the sense that he knows his film history, and pays homage to great directors like Truffaut and Godard. Is Tarrantino a great director like them? No. In my mind he has made one truly great movie, and couple of good movies, and a couple of duds. Tarrantino might be totally screwed, as he might be scorned for the very style he invented, the next time he comes around the mountain. True no one does Tarrrantino better than he does himself, but do we really need or want it. Maybe that's why he's hanging out on broadway with Marisa Tomei, trying his shot at acting. Which by the way, he sucks at. But you know what, I've never have made a body of work that comes close to what he has managed to accomplish in such a short period of time."

I don't really get it why it has such a high rating that it beats Fight Club and Forrest Gump? What is happening here??This movie has no story or whatsoever, no plot, no message, nothing. It's just some random 4 sh*ts mixed and there you have it. The dialogues inside are ridiculously boring. What is ""Quater Pounder with Cheese""? Who cares about ""Quater Pounder with Cheese""? It's just a random dialogue and it isn't important, isn't even entertaining. Everything is just so bad except the actors, I give credits to them but if you remove the actors factor, this movie is just a pile of garbage."

                        ","Caveat Disney-goer... take the good with the bad, eh?","Personally, I have to say that I find this to be one of the most enthralling films I've ever seen. Let me warn any readers now, that some of the reviews you find for this film give it an utter pan. Well, everyone is entitled to an opinion, I suppose.Some decry its obsessive use of profanity -- ever walk down a city street and NOT hear that much cussing? Some bemoan the excessive amount of death and violence and general ""no way, that's just not real, could never happen"" shenanigans -- they live in pretty neighborhoods, not backstreet *anywhere*.This movie is the treasure it is because of the incredible level of true grime and underbelly it shows in its treatment of the New Gangster. Fair warning! It's not a pretty sight! This movie is for the same person that enjoys the speeding bullet, car-wrecking, general riot and havoc type of film...But that's not all! We also see the return of John Travolta, and the meteoric Samuel Jackson! We hear dialogues that are not about backstory. Because they aren't! They're *real* people, having *real* conversations. And that, my fellows, is one of the fabulous things. We get to go along for a ride with pushers and boxers and law-breakers and murderous rednecks. And that's just the first time you watch it.Wow.PS: This movie also falls under the ""Inverse-Bruce"" Rule: A lot of Bruce Willis is not so good, but a little Bruce is incredible.PPS: Pulp Fiction: Where it's always 4:20 (unless it's Seven Twenty-Two in the A.M., of course...)"

If you're not planning on doing this, don't watch it! Then of course there's the mystery behind Pulp Fiction. What's in the briefcase?

9 December 2017,graydonsmith-05746,1,2,10,A dark and Grimy Pastiche of Crime Movie Tropes,"Pulp Fiction is one of the last great American films of the 20th century, a pastiche of crime, thriller and action tropes compressed into one masterwork of directing, story-telling and comedy. After viewing this film so many times that I have lost track within the last year alone, I never fail to see more hidden details and more beauty within Tarantino's work here. I would argue that this film surpasses all of the elements inspiring it, that it is truly a film greater than the sum of its' parts. The fractured narrative, dark comedy and characters all weave you into a world that is grimy and filthy yet never loses its' veneer of pure, unadulterated fun. The film draws you in with it's one-liners about Big Kahuna burger and the famous scene in Jimmy's kitchen, but what really enthralls me as a viewer is the masterful way in which Tarantino draws the viewer into the live's of these characters, removes the low-brow quality normally associated with excessive gore and obscenities, and with it makes art out of the dark aspects of human nature."

Jackson and Uma Thurman. I think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of Cinema that I saw in my life I think it's incredible how a great movie like ""Pulp Fiction"" didn't won the Oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent ""Forrest Gump"".

                        ",Best movie in 90's.,"Why I think this is the best movie for last 10 years?There a lot of movies with good actors,dialogues,story and other parameters which make movie to be a good one.But Pulp Fiction is movie without a mistake.Every scene,every dialogue,every little detail make sense.Every actor done best performing in this movie no matter how his/her role was small. I think Pulp Fiction deserves a little higher place than 30 at Top 250."
19 February 2005,straightballin,1,3,10,An absolutely wonderful movie,"From the very beginning you are drawn into the movie with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, who by the way have wonderful chemistry on screen, debating whether a foot massage is considered cheating. An all star cast consisting of the aforementioned Jackson and Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames really give this movie a dimension unknown to film making today. Quentin Tarantino's style of extraordinary dialogue, and his ability to make even the most grotesque scenes comical is pure genius. However, the real beauty in this movie is the soundtrack. Unlike some of the more mainstream films today, Quentin isn't concerned with bringing a certain demographic through the doors by choosing modern music that researchers believe will appeal to that demographic; he actually chooses music appropriate to the movie. Quentin Tarantino's best movie to date."

The raw brutality of Vincent (Travolta) is perfectly matched by the deep philantropical persona of his partner Jules (Jackson), whose friend Jimmy (Tarantino) is their diametral opposite, a homely guy who would never hurt a bug.

8 March 2005,ynotsto3,1,3,10,Surely one of the all time great films of the modern age.,"This is truly a great film, and always enjoyable no matter how many times you view it! Probably the BEST performance ever by Samuel L. Jackson! The fact that he didn't get the Oscar nomination for this film, and Travolta did is totally a joke. I cant say enough to do his performance justice. If you like Samuel L. Jackson this is a MUST SEE! Also the scene with Tarantino himself is very funny! The way Tarantino ties all the various related plot lines together is masterful. Truly a work of art by one of the most exciting film makers working today.

I was never into films until about three years ago and had to study an auteur so I picked Tarantino and I am sooo glad after I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time I thought whats all the fuss about but after watching it a second time I realised what all the critics were on about its fantastic one of the best film to come out of America in a long while and I suspect it will be a couple more years before a legend such as Quentin will appear on our screens once again!"

He is very aware of his one directing, Tarantino, and he seems like a very intelligent person. Therefore I say that Pulp Fiction is a movie, that indeed deserves 10 stars."

                        ",Greatest Movie ever,"Maybe Pulp Fiction copies a bit from the classics but who cares. How could Tarintino better the superb reservoir Dogs, it isn't easy. But with Pulp Fiction he has done it. The acting is out of this world, and the soon to be what ever happened to John Travolta made a magnificent comeback and is now back on form. But the greatest acting comes from the one and only Samuel L Jackson who gives probably the best supporting performance i have ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies including all the classics but this still stays in my mind as the best movie ever made."

                        ",One of the few times I've ever agreed with the religious right,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theater and it really wasn't what I expected.  I saw Reservoir Dogs on tape a few months before and thought it was a pretty interesting-- albeit pretty simple-- little movie. Everybody mentioned the ear-slicing scene.  And while it was a little disturbing, I thought it was done to show the horror of violence or something.  But after watching the *very* similar Pulp Fiction I guess I was misled.  Strangely, nobody who saw Pulp Fiction mentioned how violent it was.  Just how cool and funny it was.  So when I realized that I was part of the very small minority who didn't bust out laughing when one of the characters would off-handedly get raped or blown away, I started thinking that maybe our society really was going downhill.  It just kind of shocked me that not only was it casually accepted by the audience, but that it was also apparently really funny.And I also don't see how flimsy pop culture-laced dialogue makes it such a cool movie.  Maybe if Reality Bites threw in tons of hilarious violence and homosexual rape it'd be lauded as one of the best movies of all time.  I mean, the difference between McDonald's in Holland and America?  That didn't impress anyone after I came back from a trip to Europe, much less millions of movie-going people around the world.  Painfully stretched-out conversations about milkshakes and bacon?  Whether a massage is ever ""more than a massage""?  And that part towards the end with Harvey Keitel?  Man, it just drags.  ""Get rid of the body and then clean the blood off the car."" Wow, ingenious advice.  But he enjoys fine coffee too!  The irony!  He's a hard-ass criminal AND he likes good coffee!If only I filmed all those worthless hours spent talking with my dorky friends in diners.  And then blew some of them away.  While blasting a Barry Manilow song in the background."

                        ",My all time favorite,"Pulp fiction is my absolute all time favorite movie. It is the best piece of maybe the best director around, Quentin Tarantino.The movie shows several episodes which feature a boxer, two gangsters getting a briefcase, the bosses daughter having an o.d., a gangster pair robbing a restaurant, and through weird coincidences those episodes are all linked, the order is messed around, and there it is.Part of what makes this movie so great are the just incredible dialogues. Tarantino has a truly original style here that you will only find in his other movies or maybe some Rodriguez films. Also, the acting is just extraordinary. Just look at the cast: Samuel l. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Tarantino himself...I do believe that everybody ought to see this movie once. I watch about every other month. Ok, there is some violence and one really gory scene and a lot of foul language, not to mention drug use, but that shouldn't stop you from watching it.I highly highly recommend this movie."

Ask me to list my reasons, and I could go on and on about the acting, characters, dialogue, or unexpected plot twists. But instead, I've finally realized just why I love this movie so much.I started to obsess over Pulp Fiction after I went on the internet and read about all the things about Pulp Fiction I might have never realized by casually watching the movie: what was in ""the briefcase"", what Ezekiel 25:17 means, even little things like who keyed Vincent's car. What I'm trying to say is, if you watched Pulp Fiction one or two times and didn't love it, do a little internet research on this flick. Believe me, after you have read all there REALLY is to the plot, you will see three times the movie that you first thought was there, and it will All Make Sense.In fact, I only truly enjoyed Pulp Fiction the third time I watched it. But the plot is certainly not the only reason I love it. All of the characters are memorable and fit into the story like jigsaw pieces. You will ask yourself who the real main character was - Samuel L. Jackson? John Travolta? Ving Rhames? My little ""obsession"" with this movie has gotten to the point where I've taken a survey over who is better - Jules or Vincent?To wrap it up - I believe Pulp Fiction is the greatest movie of the 90's, and think that you should really indulge yourself in a bit of the trivia and make it a part of your world. Then perhaps you will agree with me that it's depth, dialogue, and characters make even movies such as Forrest Gump seem dim-witted and hurried."

                        ",Cool gangster flick,"Quentin Tarentino masterfully plays with the element of time in this Oscar-winning black comedy. He weaves four seperate stories that brilliantly come together. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the slightly overweight hitman that has to kill boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who doublecrossed his boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In another story Vincent and Julius, another hitman, played by Samuel L. Jackson, go on a trip to recover a case of stolen money from a couple of small time gangsters and accidently kill their contact in their car. This is where the Wolfman (Harvey Keitel) comes in and saves the day. In between we see how boxer Butch Coolidge and hitman Vega struggle in everyday life and how Jules is enlightened. This all starts with the robbery of the diner where Jules and Vince discuss religion and saviour and where we meet robbers Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer who are taught a lesson by gangster Jules. Definately a movie to watch and well worth the Oscar"
2 November 2000,marius.lahti,0,1,10,The greatest movie ever,"When you have actors like Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis all in the same movie, the movie just can´t be bad. And if that movie is also directed by the best director ever, Quentin Tarantino, you can certainly expect a masterpiece. And this movie doesn´t let you down! It has everything you can ask for a movie. It´s funny, exciting and beautiful. The music in the movie is great and the dialogues and the dancing scenes are unforgettable. The plot is very complicated and brilliant and you can watch this movie over and over again and you´ll never get bored. Only mr. Tarantino can make movies that are at one moment very funny and at the next moment shocking and frightening. Samuel L. Jackson makes his best performance ever in this movie (especially the Hezekiel 25.17-scene is amazing). John Travolta makes a great comeback in this movie and Uma Thurman is also in her best form.

The cast list alone is impressive, Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, and many other top celebrities, along with walk on parts for Steve Buscimi, and even Quentin Tarantino himself.The Overall plot of Pulp Fiction could be quite hard to follow as it isn't set out chronologically, but you will figure out what's happening when, eventually. I've watched this film around 5 or 6 times and every time I watch it I notice something new. The first time I watched it I thought it was more of a crime action/thriller but you will soon realise that it can be classed quite easily as a comedy. Alot of the jokes are well hidden and there are a few in-jokes, but anyone on this website will probably get them. One point though, this film is not for the faint hearted, there are some scenes of violence, and general not being nice, one scene in particular which I seriously hope you wouldnt want to see, I won't say any more but.... yuck"
30 March 2005,vanderwr,1,3,10,Pulp Fiction,"Man, I don't know how to explain this, let alone how to start. This movie is just the best EVER. Everything is perfect!!! My big time favorite is the dialogues, S L Jackson and J Travolta are just PERFECT, best dialogues ever. Also the setting is always great, I could watch that movie for days without getting bored. And of course the story is great, how everything flows over in each other, superb! And of course what I REALLY liked of this, all the information in the movies, all the hidden things in the movie that you don't notice after watching it just one time, makes it so mysterious! It is not just a 3 hour movie, there is sooooo much more to discover! Well, that was my opinion about the best movie ever, also (of course) Tarantino's best work. The four rooms was oke, Kill Bill too commercial.LATER! Wouter"
13 December 2000,danyalcevik,0,1,10,Great storyline,"Very good acting, exceptionally interesting storyline, creating his own ambiance and keeping your attention till the very least scene. John Travolta shows he's a great actor and Bruce Willis always gets the best out a character, you have to watch the movie at least two times, to get a good view on the whole storyline."
3 January 2001,lautje13,0,1,10,without a doubt; the best movie ever,"This movie is without a doubt the best movie I ever saw in my (short)life. Ever since the first time I've seen it I loved it. The story is a bit complex in the beginning, but the way the different stories come together and how everything works out is fabulous. The acting from actors is great. I think at least one of them should have won an oscar( three we're nominated; john travolta, uma thurman and samuel l. jackson) Uma Thurman deserves it the most; her short but strong preformance is fantastic. The way she plays the dancing part and the OD-ing part is so convincing, that you almost get they idea that she is really on drugs. Of course Quentin Tarantino is a very talented director/scriptwriter/actor. Absolutly one of the best. If you like this movie, you should watch resevoir dogs and From dusk till dawn. The case by Pulp Fiction is the more you watch the movie the more you like it and you see more and more details that make the movie so great. It's absolutly a classic!"
8 May 2019,rbrtdwht,0,1,10,Masterful screenplay and a movie that can never be viewed too many times,A pioneering movie in so far that it abandons the conventions of normal chronology without the need update its audience. Intense characters and a storyline that jumps from dark to light and back again...and then there's the dialogue! No movie script has surpassed this and those that get close are usually written by Tarantino.
4 April 2006,william-young6,0,2,10,"Best Movie Ever, here's why...","This is my all-time favorite movie, and it's hard for a guy who watches as many movies as me to even have an all-time favorite. Quentin Tarantino created this film at a time when movies were so stale, it made me sick. Other big hit movies of 1994: Homeward Bound, House Party 3, Ernest Goes to School, and Cherry Poppers 3-6. Yeah, OK, the porns weren't really hits and neither was House Party 3, but you get the picture I hope. Movies sucked in '94. Until Pulp Fiction.I begged my mom to take me to see it in theater, me being the tender age of 12 still when it came out. She wouldn't let me go until she saw it first. After she saw it, she told me to never see it. This only piqued my interest more. After all, my mom had let me rent Jason Goes to Hell. So, sadly I had to wait for video release to see the movie. I went down to Jim's Market, and yes, it's actually called that. I grew up in a town of less than 200. Our video store had 1 copy of every movie, and it was always in. Even Star Wars Episode 1, the day after it came out. I went down to the store, got the film (They really didn't care about ratings and kids in this small town), snuck it home, and watched it in my room while my mom played bridge with her friends. I was blown away. This movie is the movie that made me start to really appreciate cinema. This movie, made me look at all the little details that make a movie good.From his choice of actors to the soundtrack to the story presentation and amazing cinematography, this movie is as close to perfect as a movie gets. I have watched the film over 100 times easily, and it never really gets old for me. Totally worth getting grounded for a week when my mom caught me slipping the video into my school bag to take back to the video store."

21 September 2005,martinhust,1,3,9,Be entertained,"Pulp Fiction is a very good movie. It deserves to be hailed as one of the best movies ever to be made. Pulp Fiction is sheer entertainment at it's very best. After watching 2/3 of the movie you've got nothing - you've just been watching a reel of historical movie scenes. You haven't got a red line to follow until the last few scenes, where it all comes falling together. You've just been thrilled by the best entertainer of a movie, for 2 hours hour, when the movie makes this genius move, to keep you contemplating for at least another week. No deep meanings here, like in 8 1/2 or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Just a 2 1/2 hour roller coaster, with an infinite amount of riddles. Like Marsellus' neck patch, the weird character that Harvey Keitel plays (The Wolf, problem solver) and the contents of the briefcase. What also strikes you when watching a Tarantino movie is the dialog  I've only seen one director master the art as good  Stanley Kubrick, but that's a different story. This is purely an hail to the movie that made a huge impact on me. The spectacular dialog, and great acting  and not to mention the story ending up in a beautiful circle! Entertaining at it's best! Compliments to Quentin Tarantino!"

Secondly, the characters built Quentin Tarentino characters with logical diagonal diagonal proportions in characters and for seriousness in other characters in addition to the amazingly written dialogues that gave the characters depth and deep dimension"

                        ",Amazing,"Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that everyone needs to see. The plot is so unique that this movie has invented a new gangster genre all its own. This movie leaves no room for boredom. The reason for this is because the plot floats back and forth so much that you stay interested just by trying to understand what is going on. I will admit that it took me two times of watching to fully understand, but after realizing what the movie was about I saw its greatness. If I could sum the movie up in one word it would be ironic. From start to end the humor, the three stories, and the characters themselves, everything in this movie is based on irony. I believe Tarantino's use of irony is the source of his great influence on the genres of today's society."

And would just like to first off say that a lot of you who are giving over-elaborated reviews of this film - Just stop. This movie doesn't doesn't need to be broken down bit by bit for you to display your love for the film, OK? Anyway..I can't really say anything fresh or new about this film that hasn't already been said in a way before. I recently read a column in Stuff Magazine with B-movie king Roger Corman citing this as one of his all-time favs and that ""Pulp Fiction has elements of exploitation films but it adds complexity of character and humor in the mix"" which is something thats so true but something I found interesting because I never read someone with the same view on the film. Which is whats so nice about a movie like PF. Like groundbreaking films before it - Slacker, Strangers in Paradise etc. - Its open to all interpretations and they vary from surprising to stupid to what you'd expect and I think thats just great. Moreover, I think I'll quit with this gushing and get going. Thanks to anyone who reads this and May you have a good one!Signed, Parapalygic Dwarf"

The masterpiece without a messageOne of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence"

3 June 2019,s-39418-30378,0,0,9,Pulp Fiction: The Movie Like No Other,"The well established filmmaker and director Quentin Tarantino is known for his violent and satirical subject matter, untraditional and nonlinear narrative form, and ensemble casts with actors who have regularly appeared in previous Tarantino's movies. When I personally think of a Quentin Tarantino film, I think of over-the-top graphic violence and eloquent, dynamic, punchy, and sometimes extended dialogue. I believe that Tarantino's second film, Pulp Fiction is the most distinguished and prominent Tarantino film to ever hit the box office because there is no film that will completely make an utter mockery of America's key principles and moral and cultural values like Pulp Fiction does. It also has an extremely profound script which creates an ironic twist between humor and gore.The storyline is interwoven with numerous different characters and their relationships to one another. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are the world's' most philosophical hitmen. They are hired by a gangster named Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his beautiful wife Mia (Uma Thurman). When Marsellus gets screwed over in a deal by the famous boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), Marsellus hires Vega and Winnfield to take care of him.A particular scene that stuck out in the film was when Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield were driving in their car after they broke into an apartment to complete a contract. They had taken the only survivor from the apartment, a young man named Marvin. Vega accidentally shot him in the face with his .45 caliber during a seemingly harmless conversation. This scene is one of the most violent scenes, yet one of the most humorous because Vega and Winnfield are yelling back and forth while the whole backseat (and Winnfield's hair) has brain matter splattered about. This scene is important because it provides evidence that Pulp Fiction has an exceptional cast and an exceedingly rich script.There are a few negatives and flaws I would point out. The storyline jumps around to different characters and different points in time which can confuse the audience and make them unaware of what is currently taking place. Another negative would be the fact that the overall plot is interfered with Tarantino's self-indulgence with his own personal fixations. This can draw attention away with the themes and perspectives that really matter. Lastly, the most important flaw is the blatant homophobia and racism that can be extremely offensive to some more sensitive viewers. The abundance and excessive use of the n-word has the potential to probably turn off a sufficient target audience. The prejudices found in this movie seem to fly due to the fact there is usually a pop-culture reference or joke that is said directly afterwards that seem to mask the potentially disconcerting message.The reason why I previously stated that Pulp Fiction is the greatest Tarantino film to ever hit the box office is because I loved the screenplay and the acting. The script was extremely perplexing because it didn't seem like Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary tried too hard to write it. Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was critiqued for its screenplay because movie critics thought that the writers were ""trying too hard to be cool."" I liked the acting because I am personally a fan of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. I also thought it was entertaining to see Tarantino slip himself into a couple minor scenes. The special effects were superb for the year it was released in 1994. This is important because Tarantino loves to entertain the audience with exaggerated violence and gore, and weak special effects in this film would hamper the movies quality, and make it look cheesy and low budget. I also enjoyed the aspect of the storyline not being presented in chronological order. I found this to add a unique and somewhat unpresidented style to the film. Lastly, I thoroughly relished the overall style and setting of the movie. I have never seen a somewhat neo-noir crime thriller that somehow sprinkles in a perfect concoction of dramatic themes with a dark comedic blend.Overall, I found Pulp Fiction to be incredibly sublime and remarkable. I advise anybody to see this film, as it is a cornerstone for independent movies. I truly believe that this film is a classic, and one of the best movies created in film history, but I'm sure many would object. This movie has no specific genre, so if you like movies in general, I would advise to see it."
2 February 2001,redeemer-1,0,1,10,A great movie that will keep you on the end of your seat,The first time i saw this movie was at a friends house. I was only 11 at the time and i never really understood the real content of the movie. But as i grew older and matured i watched it over and over again and now that i know what it is all about i can appreciate it a little more. The movie became my life. I would watch it almost everyday and never get sick of it. I would show it to my friends and anyone else who was interested in watching it. I dont know why it took me like it did but there was just something about it. A film filled with great one liners and sayings that would make you look at the world of crime a lot more differently. Very offensive in more ways than one but if you can manage to look past the endless use of four letter words than you will probably like it. If you havent seen Pulp Fiction than see it because you will miss the number one movie of all time

27 May 2006,boomdoggidogg,2,6,10,The Single Greatest Film Ever Made,"Pulp Fiction just may be the best movie that has ever graced film, thats including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and Gone With The Wind. anyone who says that its just a ""violent, profanity filled movie"" is not only wrong but very stupid. Just cause something is violent doesn't make it a bad movie, and people should learn that there's a difference between pointless violence and violence in context. Tarantino does a good job making his character's ""real"". they have conversation's that sound like something that you would say to your buddy on the way to work. it also has some of the best acting EVER. in my opinion it should have won over Forrest gump at the 1994 acadamy awards, don't get me wrong i loved Forrest gump but pulp fiction was better.

24 September 2014,ohsotricky,1,3,6,The Path of the Righteous Man,"Pulp Fiction, a dark, gangster drama, directed by Quentin Tarantino, received many awards for best screenplay and revived many careers of the actors in the film. At the time of its release, the film reeked of cinematic expression. Mr. Tarantino is a clever storyteller, giving the audience exactly what they want in a gangster movie. The story is anything but typical and unconventionally follows the lives of a very colorful cast. To catalog Pulp Fiction in just one genre would be to discount it from other's and would be unfair. Often referred to as a ""black comedy"", the tale centers on the relationship between two gangsters / hit-men and could be categorized as an off -beat gangster flick. However, the story (like the scenes in the movie) jumps from one place to another. For example, one moment it is a serious ""drama"" (as characters are brutally assassinated), then comes a ""romance"" between a couple desperately attempting to escape reality. A night on the town, with flirtation amongst bizarrely matched characters leads to an overdose. This movie includes everything a Tarantino film lover demands; drugs, violence, sex, romance, music, dancing, sport, and even retention of one's soul. Each scene is developed first by dialog and then through actions, creating a series of consequences with serious and profound results. At first, the non-traditional editing was disturbing. However, after re-watching certain scenes again, it became clearer. Mr. Tarantino challenges the viewer to reassemble the pieces of the story in chronological order on their own. Figuring out what came first, the chicken or the egg is key to providing insight in solving the many puzzles in this story. The use of sound and score in Pulp Fiction effectively provided texture to each scene. The songs chosen for the film effortlessly set the stage for each escapade. Listening to the soundtrack provokes multifaceted thoughts and memories. The cunning cinematic techniques used in Pulp Fiction include eccentric configurations and framing, supporting both the tone and mood of the movie. The long pauses' precluding the violence fosters tension on screen, creating intensity driven drama. The use of such a wide variety of camera angles provides the audience with a unique viewing experience and indicates the work of a true artist. The direct and indirect influences of this movie are not readily apparent to the viewer. Each social class represented in Pulp Fiction faces some type of moral dilemma, and each character must work through their respective dilemma, despite their current situations. Lack of value and consequence seems to be the meaning of the story. Following the path of the righteous man is a common theme throughout. I feel as though each scene contained an exaggerated amount of morality, and the screenplay suffered a bit because of this. Too much time was spent on showing the audience the bad stuff, and not enough on the characters' lives. The best part of the film was the music and the dance scene between Vincent and Mia. I would recommend the film to a very mature, bored audience, as if you watch all 154 minutes of this film, you may wish for your time back."
25 May 2006,eoj414141,0,2,10,Pulp Fiction is overrated but Titanic is great?!!!?!?!????!?,"I cannot stand when people who get offended by violence and foul language come on this website and call movies like Pulp Fiction garbage. It is beyond me how a movie like Titanic can be so widely praised when a movie like Pulp Fiction is called,""overrated"". Quintin Tarantino is a great director. He's good enough to make John Travolta pass as a halfway decent actor, keep in mind this guy was in ""Battlefield Earth"". Tarantino brilliantly casted this movie, with a young Uma Thurman and of course Samuel L. Jackson, and although Sam is a great actor to begin with, his performance in Pulp Fiction stands above the rest.It is an amazing movie and he's an amazing director. That's it."

A wonderful film, it's very haunting due to their particular stories, their characters were intriguing, you could identify this in each part of the film, the film centrates always in situations relationated to a character whose economical earning is illegal, and trust in two entertaining characters actuaded by John Travolta and Samuel Jackson. Their dialogues are thought-provoking in some cases, you could identify more when there´s no heavy-going scenes, for example, when you drink coffee with a friend, walking in the street, driving in a traffic jam, etc.
There´s a lot of Tarantino's magic in the scenes, they were griping from beginning to end, a lot of feelings and controversial thinkings, in my case the first scene I feel astonished due to Samuel's actuation, only for make a highlighting to this, the other scenes were fascinating, because whole the stories link together, to my amazement, the final scene is relationated to the beginning, a wonderful film, you must see it."
20 February 2005,tranquilo1212,1,4,10,The definition of a masterpiece and the best movie of all time,"Quentin Tarantino makes this film what it is. His attention to detail, sense of irony, dark humor and ability to create characters with equally recognizable and memorable traits make this movie an unparalleled masterpiece.The vastness and complexity of the plot prevents flaws and keeps the viewer intrigued. It also contains the element of surprise. Tarantino makes fun of surprise twists, so the results are often darkly hilarious and occasionally quite disturbing.The movie is in essence a study of four cases of characters with rigid personalities meeting and seeing who gives in first. Samuel L. Jackson plays Jules Winnfield, a gangster who doesn't budge to anyone and takes advantage of others with his voice. Jackson has talked down opponents in many movies, but never as well as he does here. Jules' partner in crime, Vincent Vega, is played by John Travolta. This movie was a renaissance for Travolta, as it began his trend of playing tough guys who play it cool (as in ""Get Shorty""). The boss of Jules and Vincent is Marsellus Wallace, who is played by Ving Rhames. Marsellus is clearly defined as someone you do not want to anger or mess with, like any traditional mob head. His wife Mia, played by Uma Thurman, is a drug addicted party girl who lives the flashy life her husband's business has made her accustomed to. Finally, there is Butch Coolidge, a tough as nails boxer whose wits and disobedience put his life in danger.All these characters meet up with each other in different ways in the intertwining stories of the movie. The interactions between these characters are what makes the movie work despite the lack of a truly linear plot. The way that scenes are filmed and the plot is placed is taken from other movies; Tarantino is a genius at combining elements of older movies into a film that is equally intricate and rich in humor, gore, characters, plots. He has done this for all of his films. However, of all of his films, this is his best. And for the intricacies involved, it may be THE best movie...of all time.If nothing else, this movie will be revered 40 years from now the same way that ""The Godfather"" is today."
7 June 2006,sigmund-13,0,2,10,Excellent Movie!,"Quentin Torantino's masterpiece of directing Pulp Fiction is ""directing"" at it's finest. He managed to combine art, amorality, character development, gutter language and combine it all within mixing cultural and societal elements at a time when it was unheard of in cinema. And he made the characters believable, vulnerable, full of character flaws and very charismatic. The remarkable thing about this movie is that it made it into theaters at all in the hight of the era of ""political correctness"", ""feminism"", ""O.J. Simpson trial"" and ""Rodney King"" fiasco. It rejuvenated the flagging movie career of John Travolta. This movie rates up there with ""A Clockwork Orange"" which was Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece.Perhaps what stands out in ""Pulp Fiction"" the most is Torantino's intelligent dialogue, believable characters, everyday human mistakes that turn into the most absurd yet believable circumstances. It is truly an ""orginal"""
5 December 2014,paristb,1,3,10,Epic awesomeness,"I will always turn to Pulp Fiction when I think of a favorite movie. Apart from the cultural impact that it has, one cannot deny the fact that as a movie, technically speaking, is excellent. What to think of first? The dialogs are epic, Tarantino cannot top this as far as he tries with his newest movies. The photography is plain and simple as it fits in the background of the film. The acting is...oh god. Give these guys three Oscars. One to Samuel, one to John and one to Bruce. They all deserve it. The movie starts in a rush and does not calm down for a moment... which is good...Every one can find his / her favor scene. Grats to Tarantino for this excellent piece of art.

19 March 2001,stepenpit,0,1,10,The movie of the 90's.,"Simply put, Pulp Fiction has influenced nearly every crime-oriented movie since 1994.  Advertisers have used songs from the soundtrack to sell everything from cars to hotel rooms.  Actors have dreamt of having their careers reborn ala John Travolta.  Pulp Fiction single-handedly catapulted Quentin Tarantino into the American mainstream.  This moving is deserving of the highest critical praise, from the flawless acting to the rhetoric laced dialogue.  An absolute must-see."
7 July 2006,luke_fallon1,0,4,10,A tale that takes place over a span of 3 days and inter-connects an assortment of characters,"This movie is a movie on so many levels. Its a drug film, a love story , a crime/drama etc. Tarantino really created a cult classic. He told the story in such an odd way that it made me have to see it over and over again to really understand what the hell was going on. The scene when Vincent accidentally blows his hostage's head apart in the car when Jules hits a speed bump is hysterical. Then they must take the blood covered car to Jule's friend Jimmy's house who is obviously angered cause Vince and Jules think there's a sign that says ""Dead person Storage"".Also pretty funny. Tarantino is known for extremely clever dialog, probably because he's written a bunch of movies. Pulp Fiction is one of those kinds of flicks that will never be forgotten. Mainly because of its affect on pop culture. This movie has been parodied dozens of times. However this movie will not be remembered for how many times it was mocked but for how many times it was praised."

The move summed up is about the 48 hours of a pair of hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife and the meeting of their fates. The movie also introduced a great concept of 'out of time sequence'.

Another classic is Jackie Brown although not up to the same standard as Tarantino's first two films it is still a very good film. Just recently saw the release of Quentin and Uma's story of the bride. although in two parts Kill Bill some believe to be Tarantino's best work to date and will go down I'm sure in a lot of peoples top ten films ever!"

Ever since that I look differently at the movies.It had changed my attitude to the whole cinema industry. I can say it was the 'beginning'. It had so massive impression on me that i had to watch all the movies with the actors of pulp fiction. It made me understand ,there is difference between movie and movie.
It might be a precious movie for me because im a 90's kid but I know others who aint that but still like it. Anyway the movie takes you right into the 90s vibe with tobaco smoke , oldschool outfits , cars , music, drug use . gangster life and love.
The dialogues are great and have deep meaning. It serious when its needs to be and sometimes it doesn't make any sense just simply badass. There is action ,fun ,romance ,crime everything. If you are into that ,then it wont dissapoint you."

                        ",The most Overrated Film in history,"After reading the comments for this film, I noticed that there seems to be a lack of intelligent negative criticism directed towards Pulp Fiction.  This is easily the most overrated movie of all time.  I suspect that critics are afraid to publicly criticize certain directors (such as Scorsese or Kubrick), and somehow Quentin Tarantino got added to this ""untouchable"" list (possibly excluding the painful From Dusk til Dawn series).Pulp Fiction has nothing to endear itself to movie watchers.  It is very mildly humorous, but infrequently.  It is neither focused on the action nor the romance present in the script.  The most common praise I see is that the dialogue is ""sharp"".  This compliment is ambiguous at best, but is also weak and applies to hundreds of movies, many with much better and more insightful dialogue.Pulp Fiction is a weak entry from a director that seems to garnish undeserved praise from critics everywhere.  I suppose they must have fallen in love with the pricelessly insipid Reservoir Dogs."

8 August 2005,0mega,1,3,10,"A movie that has deserved the title of ""The Best""","""Pulp Fiction"" is a masterpiece, a pure masterpiece. There are not many movies that can be watched over and over, and which still have a fresh feeling every time. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be one of those movies and by far the greatest of them, the best movie that has been yet made.Giving a one movie the title of ""the best"" is a gutsy thing to do, but I'm convinced that """"Pulp Fiction"" deserves that title. A movie like ""The Godfather"" is an excellent piece of a criminal drama. It's intense, distressing and respectable movie in it's category, the best of it's genre. But the reason why it can't be the best of them all, is the reason it has a clear genre. The same goes for ""Memento"", ""Psycho"", ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Pianist"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and many other movies that represent the best of their genre. All of those movies has a power to provoke strong emotions from its viewer. That is if the viewer happens to enjoy movies from the particular genre.What makes ""Pulp Fiction"" different from any other movie is the fact that is has no genre. It's comedy, drama, thriller, action, crime, et cetera. Pulp Fiction is everything and it feels like everything. Because of that anyone can see the movie and love it. While watching ""Pulp Fiction"", all kinds of emotions start running through. A viewer feels joy, sorrow, excitement, confusion, comprehension and a large set of other emotions. It's also interesting that even though this movie makes its viewer to go through so intense set of different emotions, it manages to create a perfect equilibrium with everything. After the movie is over, the experience is like after no other movie. The viewer has no central emotion, all the human emotions are active. Love, hate, happiness, sorrow, excitement, confusion are only the tip of the iceberg about the emotions that are felt at the same time. Really strange mix of emotions, impossible to explain, but something that must be experienced.Of course that doesn't apply for everyone. There's always a minority of people who can't feel the same as the majority does. When it comes to ""Pulp Fiction"" the reason for not feeling the same way could be it's violent theme, it's sexual content, it's nonlinear storytelling, anything that just doesn't isn't acceptable in the eyes of the viewer. But because this movie is a mix of so many different movie genres, it's the movie that will most likely give anyone the best movie experience that he or she has ever experienced."
23 October 2006,bdgfrx,0,3,10,Why Pulp Fiction is the greatest movie ever,"When I first saw Pulp Fiction I was blown away. I saw it twice the same day, basking in the gloriousness of this film. The film is an amazing amalgam of fabulous characters, a great plot, and the best dialogue I have ever heard in a movie.The driving force behind the film is Tarantino's, sheer wild ass joy of film-making. He loves to make his characters fun yet real, having them participate in dialouges that range from food in Europe to the cleanliness of pigs and dogs. Though the film tears apart the conventions of a linear story, the plot still manages to be easilly followable and never feels too complicated or convoluted. This is the aspect of the film that I enjoy the most.Tarantino's masterpiece is the finest film of the nineties, a clever mix of characters with angst and well written grit. Pulp Fiction is a milestone in modern film, defying rules and making new ones in the process."
7 April 2020,andreaspinato,1,3,9,One of the best film I've ever seen,I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and this is surely his major creation! I love the fact that in this film there are many stories that are interweaving so nicely.Surely a Must to see!!
3 November 2006,aharris-23,0,3,10,This is a must see movie.,"Pulp Fiction I believe is one of the greatest films ever written. Quentin Tarantino is a great director, writer and actor. I love how he always has a cameo part in his movies. The best part of Pulp Fiction is even though it has flash backs through out the entire film you still enjoy the movie, but the flash backs just make you want to go back and watch the movie over and over again because you feel like you may have missed something. There may be many people that are offended by the unique way Quentin Tarantino shows the really dirty side of the crime world. I believe he did exactly what he wanted to do and he accomplished it with flying colors. Everyone of the actors and actresses in this movie were cast perfectly for each and every part. When you put everything together, the cast, story, and direction you can't go wrong."

The movie also produces some of the most stylish and memorable scenes and characters that you will ever see, with the wonderfully intriguing dialogue produced by Tarantino multiplied over by a cast that produced some of the most memorable performances ever.

4 October 2001,SuperflynShaft,0,1,10,"By far, the greatest film ever made","PULP FICTION is, as I said, by far the greatest film ever made. It is simply perfect. I cannot say enough good things about this film. Of course there will be many people who disagree with me, so I will say this with confidence: PULP FICTION is the greatest film that QUENTIN TARATINO has ever been involved with.Now, without giving away too much of the greatness of this film, I will give a brief describtion of the plot. The film stars JOHN TRAVOLTA & SAMUEL L. JACKSON as two hitmen. They work for MARSELLUS WALLACE(VING RHAMES), who has just hired them to retrieve a stolen briefcase conatining God-knows-what. From their we move on the first of three segments that interwheel and make up the plot: VINCENT VEGA & MARSELLUS' WIFE. In which VINCENT VEGA(TRAVOLTA) has to take out MIA WALLACE(UMA THURMAN) while MARSELLUS is out of town on business. I dare not reveal what happens that night. For that is one of the best scenes in the movie.The second segment, THE GOLD WATCH, stars BRUCE WILLIS as BUTCH, a boxer whom MARSELLUS bribed to take a fall in his next match...BUTCH does not do this, but still got the bribe money. So MARSELLUS decides to hunt BUTCH down and kill him. "" If Butch goes to Indoe, China; I want a n***'a hidin' in a bowl a rice, ready to pop a cap in his a$$!""-MARSELLUS WALLACE. But, when BUTCH and his gal FABIENNE are on their way to Tennessee, he discovers that his priceless gold watch(which had a troubled history getting to BUTCH) isn't packed with his other stuff, so he must go get it. Which leads to alot of suspense throughout the rest of the segment. This segment is my second favorite because of the wonderful BRUCE WILLIS in a different role then his DIE HARD films, and because of suspense I spoke of earlier. And finally, we have THE BONNIE SITUATION, my favorite segment because it contains my two favorite actors: HARVEY KEITEL & TIM ROTH. This one's plot is simple and takes place in about two different places. If I told you it would give away some of the best jokes. And believe me, the situation in this segment is best kept unsaid.RATING: 4 STARS OUT OF 4"

21 September 2007,rachabeth,0,1,10,a classic ; one of my favorite films,"This film wins the title of my ""all time favorite movie"". Why? Oh, I could babble on for hours, but I won't bore or spoil you.Quentin Tarantino has created a masterpiece, three separate (yet intertwined) stories filled to the brim with violence, black humor, and memorable dialogue. Many ""gangster"" movies overlook a crucial aspect of writing - character development. That is not the case with ""Pulp Fiction"". Every single character (even the minor ones) is beautifully developed in their actions and words; the actors on the screen seem like real people - not just highly wealthy performers with guns. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver a particularly great performance, though the other major players are marvelous as well.The three separate stories are NOT told in chronological order, and the viewer may become confused at times - I was definitely lost when I first watched the movie. But after viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" a couple times, I came to appreciate the artistic angle, the overall story being more clear and real to me. The fact that Tarantino is able to pull off such a feat speaks highly of his ability.Some may call this movie ""overrated"" and ""unoriginal"" but I have to disagree. While some elements of this film could be seen as cliché, Tarantino delivers them in a fresh and enjoyable way. I'm a great hater of clichés, myself, and did not notice many glaring ones during the duration of the movie.It should be noted that this movie is not for everyone. There is foul language and violence abound, which may turn off some people. If you have a strong stomach and absolutely adore black, ironic humor (like me!), give ""Pulp Fiction"" a chance.One more great thing? The film is close to three hours long (I think. Don't quote me on that), and it feels like you've been glued to the television for an hour. I have the most difficult time paying attention to longer movies, and Tarantino keeps the viewer so engaged throughout, that you will feel like you've wasted no time at all.Happy viewing!"

Also brilliantly casted is Bruce Willis as the dodgy boxer Butch. All in all a very entertaining film, which filmmakers will borrow ideas from and use in their own films in the years to come. The idea of this being a sequel to Reservoir Dogs is a great idea and makes me think about certain connections to the film. The idea of Vincent Vega being related to Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega from Reservoir Dogs makes me go back and watch the mannerism's of Michael Madsen and see if the director had already casted Travolta as Mr. Blonde's brother while filming Reservoir Dogs.

                        ",Pulp Fiction is the best movie ever made.,"By far the greatest story telling in cinema, in my opinion. Fantastic plot, acting, directing (!), and editing, especially in the modern era of film. Became an instant classic in 1994, and remains to this day a film that others are compared to. Still afraid of pawn shops after all these years. Only ONE Oscar out of seven! Well deserved Best Original Screenplay for Roger Avary and the incomparable Quentin Tarantino. Picture, Director (Tarantino), Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson-shoulda beat Landau, even though he was brilliant as well), Supporting Actress (Thurman) and Editing. It definitely was the Pulpers against the Gumpers that year, but in a day and age where taste was brought into everything, people preferred a happy ending. C'est la Vie."

It was perfect b/c of many things, the duologue was flawless, the drama, irony and everything else was perfectly done. Even the soundtrack was perfect. All the songs just went perfectly to the scene. I love how just because Fabienne forgot butch's watch, the entire gimp scene happened with Marcellus and the hillbillies. And what happened with Marvin and Vince, and Quentin with his cameo. But the greatest duologue ever was here with Jules and Brett, amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This seriously is THE greatest movie made ever. Better than citizen kane, casablanca, wonderful life and the godfather. Acting, perfect. Dialouge, amazing. Everything, flawless. It even made me laugh a couple times."

                        ",It's Definitely Weird,"In my own opinion, Pulp Fiction was a bit twisted and without a true plot. However, the series of events that took place seemed very realistic and I give it 8 stars.  What I mean by that is simple; very well known actors very well acted all of the scenes.  There wasn't a bunch of special effects; pretty much everything you would see could have really happened without any illusions.  I found myself clenching my blanket daring to take another peep at certain points throughout the film.  No, it wasn't scary but definitely weird, weird enough to keep an audience interested.  It deserves special attention in that it is not like any other movie I have ever seen.  I know I'm being very vague about any actual details, but disclosing a small portion of the movie just wouldn't make any sense unless you've already seen it.  It's definitely not for younger kids, but worth seeing with a bunch of friends."
26 November 2021,parkssam-46904,0,2,9,Brilliant,"A brilliant cult film that has stood the test of generations, this film is a classic that remains Tarrentino's greatest work. Uma Thurman plays the roll of Mia Wallace brilliantly, as do Travolta and Willis."

This film was original and unique and I would 100% watch again."
4 December 2021,xegara,0,2,10,such a great movie,"Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' stands out from other films made in the late 20th Century - back in 1994, no-one had ever seen a film quite like it, and its success brought a wave of post-modern cinema. The stage had been set in the 1970s and 1980s with the rise of summer blockbusters, but nothing quite like 'Pulp Fiction' had been seen before 1994 (there was certainly nothing similar of such high quality, or such mass appeal)."

Gunplay, robbery, swearing, drug use, drug dealing, lying, cheating, violence, male rape, sadomasochism, and driving under the influence. A character is shot in the face and it's played for jokes. In one extremely graphic scene."
17 March 2007,tiago_alexandre_gomes,0,2,10,The best film of our age,"Such an amazing movie and an outstanding cast, including my marvelous compatriot Maria de Medeiros who has provided us with her great role, not forgetting about Quentin Tarantino, in my opinion, my favourite and the best young director at the moment. I loved the plot and specially the scenes where Jules recited those well chosen fragments of the Holy Bible, Ezekiel 25:17, ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."". The part when Mia Wallance and Vincent Vega dance is one of my favorite's too, it's already a classic, my what a dance. To sum up, if you haven't seen, you must do it urgently and remember that you are watching the greatest film of the last century."

3 January 2022,animixplay,0,0,10,Best Series,"It is a film that seems to defy any notion of. It's pure Tarantino. It is, in fact, one of the best Tarantino films. Because of the reasons that you watch again , in a sequence of time. For characters, stories, conversations and unforgettable scenes. For the music and top performance. Also, for those unexpected twists. And for the illusion to be a normal story. To evoke emotions. Also, for the way to convey them. Sure for the mysterious magical. For many other reasons."
19 January 2022,sajganovaana,0,0,9,why do we love it?,"Music is like a movie character. She is not seen, but she is heard. It evokes nostalgia or annoys the listener from the first notes. The scene in which Vincent and Mia arrive at the cafe is primarily nostalgic for the days of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. Good old songs are heard throughout the whole scene. The twist to which these two are dancing is a little boring and does not allow them to fully enjoy themselves, but the stage does not spoil at all, on the contrary, it allows you to delve into the rhythm of the music, forget about everything and watch the dance. And, of course, the title theme, which everyone must have heard a hundred times. 4. It's Pulp Fiction, it's situations! Tarantino wrote the script in Amsterdam, this is a known fact. Draw conclusions from here. Tarantino smoked, drank and did drugs. It's not hard to guess what the heroes of Pulp Fiction do...yes, they drink, smoke and do drugs..."

He is a character that personifies an ordinary person who captivates with his innocence, stupidity and sincerity at the same time. Many will say that this is a mistake. But I don't think so. Every dialogue and every appearance is a masterpiece.The other characters didn't disappoint either. But I note that there would be no Vincent Vega, there would be no Pulp Fiction. Namely, the dialogues, the generator of which is this character. It feels like Tarantino wrote all the dialogues for him."
19 January 2022,zukovdmitriiy,0,0,10,Wonderful movie,"Quentin Tarantino shot such a shocking film for its time, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), which is watched and reviewed by millions of viewers to this day. It would seem - two bandits, not the most distant mind, but how charismatic. And three short stories that you watch without stopping. And this unforgettable dance, which not only eminent actors try to dance, but also ordinary people drunk in restaurants. Surely everyone has seen more than once how they dance, parodying the gestures of Uma Thurman and John Travolta. And I am sure that now many people remember this incendiary dance melody. And these philosophical conversations between Jules and Vincent during their off-duty hours... Just an interesting story that is incredibly interesting to watch. And what actors!"

The constantly changing episodes, the ingenious dialogues, which unmistakably unmask every real Tarantino flick as such, and the absolute coolness of this film show how much sweat and blood Quentin Tarantino puts into films like this, as director & screenwriter. Not without reason, he also cleared the Oscar for ""best screenplay"" for this. Since the film consists of several episodes that only make sense at the end, you have no way to imagine an ending in advance. Everything is still possible until the last second (which is actually always the case in a typical Tarantino film), which not only makes the film more interesting, but also keeps the viewer curious and glued to the screen until the very end. By the way, the cast was an absolute hit: John Travolta, in the role of his life, Samuel L. Jackson, who was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Jules Winnfield, Bruce Willis in absolute top form and classic ""Die Hard mania"" (and many other brilliant acting performances, such as those of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Uma Thurman... To make a long story short: This film can't be surpassed in genius. A real Tarantino!"

I went to the location of the Hawthorne Grill coffee shop, used in the filming PULP FICTION, and was devastated to discover that it has been torn down and replaced with an AUTO ZONE. Oh well, the beat goes on.But, I then drove by the Beach Boys Memorial which was torn down when Interstate 105 was built about 10 years ago. The Memorial was under construction under construction near where their house used to be before it was torn down to build the freeway. It's located on 119th Street at Kornblum Avenue off 120th Street near the Hawthorne Airport. People come from around the world to see the house where the Wilson Bros. (The original Beach Boys) grew up and arrive only to find a freeway that has been built up about 40 feet in the air.I wondered whether or not the Beach Boys used to go to the Hawthorne Grill when they lived there since it's pretty close. The Beach Boys Monument is supposed to be dedicated on May 20th. They were pouring concrete today.Interstate 105 opened about 10 years ago and was used in the filming of the movie, ""Speed"", before the freeway was opened."
7 March 2002,scotts-8,0,1,9,"Brilliant, Shocking, Operatic Violence - A Royal with Cheese","An amazing cast makes this thinly plotted film a treat.  The lame plot construct is easily ignored by the unique dialogue - this is what makes the film a top choice.  Often imitated, never fully realized the film is for better or worse the comeback vehicle for Travolta, and a launching pad for Jackson.  Uma has never been more appealing.  The violence is shocking (including a rape scene), but the non-linear story line gives us a series of interwoven redemption stories that work well enough to allow us to listen to the incredible dialogue - the best Terintino will ever offer us.  Sans Dogs."
25 November 2005,sharkypanda89,1,3,10,If god watched films this is what he watches!,"This film, without doubt must be the coolest film ever. It has so much class, it has so much style, you could only wish you were as cool as some of the characters in it. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield(Samual l. Jackson) are two of the coolest characters to ever appear in a film and are played by probably THE most talented and cool actors on the planet.This is Tarantino's best film, and Tarantino's films have nothing but style. They have classic one liners and amazing soundtracks and i've already mentioned the characters and actors. If you have ever seen Reservior Dogs or Jackie Brown you would know what i mean but if you haven't i would strongly suggest to go buy them, forget renting as soon as you see them you would be amazed.Pulp Fiction is a must see and you would understand when i say it's the best film ever if you've seen it.Watch it and enjoy!"
5 November 2007,roubi-m,0,2,10,Great,"I personally think that Pulp Fiction is one of the few good American films. Lots of sovereign sayings. For example in the beginning when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson go through the corridor and they speak about the foot massage, when Bruce Willis and his girlfriend speak about their breakfast, when John Travolta cleans his hands because he was dirty of the blood and Samuel L. Jackson get at him because he didn't clean his hands carefully. And very good scene( my favourite ) is when Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill a young man and before it he says a lyrics of the Bible. Pulp Fiction has interestedly made plot, short stories which are dissolving. I very like this film. :-)))"

                        ",Symbolism in Pulp Fiction,"This is a comment to what Nicolaj Laugesen said about Pulp Fiction.As Nicolaj said Jules (Jules - Jesul - Jesus) is the good man, he thinks his life over when he experience ""the miracle"". Vincent is the bad man, he like his life, drugs, alcohol, parties, women and power! His last name Vega, like Las Vegas he gables with his life. At the ending scene Jules gives Tim Roth some money to safe him, Vincent want to kill him just of principal reasons! Tim Roth is just another human on the way to a criminal lifestyle, but is rescued! Tim Roth is also in Four Rooms (another movie by Quentin) and his girlfriend in Pulp Fiction is the same in Four Rooms, in this movie he has a job, he doesn't like being a clerk, though he is being p***ed on by everybody!I think Wolf is the conscience, the little voice inside your head, Jules supports him in everything he does, Vincent hate him from the minute he sees him! Or is he a midlife phase in their lives where they think thing through, Jules want out and to be clean, Vincent want his old life! In ""The Bonnie Situation"" Bonnie is a sort of jugdement day, they shall be gone when she arrives, that means that shall have chosen a side. Quentin is a reminder of that jugdement day will come.The suitcase is the temptation with the code 666, everybody who looks at it is captured in its golden shine. Notice that Vincent is the one that gets, carry and delivers the suitcase, Jules doesn't even touches it! Wallace is the devil, he sends Jules and Vincent out for the suitcase, and Vincent delivers it while Jules is on the toilet!Uma Thurman is just a satanic human, Vincent like her because she also live a life full of alcohol and drugs! When she is close to die because of drugs, she have the opportunity to think her life over. She activates her security system by pressing one key three times... 666!Butch is the the angel of death and sometimes also Jesus. His golden watch is very important to him, because if time aren't there no body will die! The part from the Bible that Jules says is Ez. 25,7, it tells about some people who was greedy and eager for vengeance, God killed them with their own weapon (revenge). Vincent only kill people in form of revenge, and as God Butch kill him with his own weapon, remember the one in the kitchen. Wallace also tempts him, he won't die but his power will be taken (Butch's power is pried), just like Satan and Jesus in the desert!Zed and his friend represents the thousands years where the angel of death, devil and his men will suffer in pain, untill God releases them for some time, after this they will all be thrown is a lake of magma. At first Butch is the angel of death, he suffers, then he returns to release him, just like God.The title Pulp Fiction describes that its something that always will be there and you can't do anything about it. Okay, almost nothing, you can believe in God for a start! The movie take place in Los Angeles, can that mean anything?Well that is what I've found out of this brilliant movie! But why does it jump in time?"

While watching the film I could imagine as if I was there.All the actors give great performances, Samual L. Jacksons being outstanding. Travolta and Thurman give great performances also. Another thing I loved was the theme of redemption, and how someone is saved at the end of every story. The movie is violent but a lot of the violence is played off screen.

From the bizarre yet believable situations, to the dialogs between characters, there is probably no other movie where I enjoy myself more. The story, is non- linear, but the thing is, is that it doesn't bother the viewer at all. The legendary opening, the legendary ending, the quotes, the soundtrack, the performances, this might just at well be considered the perfect me. To me, it is. I rarely give a movie 10/10, but Pulp Fiction is the movie that deserves it, because there is no possible way you could improve it. On a personal note, there is something about this movie that truly makes me nostalgic. Although it is stuffed with violent and nihilistic themes, this movie is like a big goodbye to the good times, and an in-your-face ""times will never bee this cool again""."

With Tarantino you never expect nothing but the best, as this movie provides just that; the best. The stories all interweave like most of his films (Kill Bill 1 & 2, Reservior Dogs, Django Unchained). The characters are wonderfully dramatic and complex. Uma Thurman is exceptional, Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious and uncaring as the trash-talking hit-man & Ving Rhaymes is wonderful as the boss. All actors are exceptional and beautiful performances but Bruce Willis (not so good). This film is not for children under the age of 17 (rated-R). Explicit language and some nudity."

I remember the first time I watched this film, it was at my grand mothers house, because one of my uncles is a huge Tarantino's fan - So he rent the picture and we enjoyed the films like crazy, After I saw this movie, I was trying to connect more with Tarantinos cinema, And Im sure his one of the best filmmakers The edition, of the film is other good point for this film, These kind of movies really show the people that you don't need to have millions of dollars to make a good films, You just need a good story, a nice script and believe in your project, and the just shoot. When we were in colleague with my friends in our cinema class Tarantino become an reference for all the students in my faculty."
17 January 2011,bryan-hucke,0,1,10,Great movie,"I love a movie that is not obvious and this one definitely fits that mold. I didn't even understand it completely until I saw it several times; and the more time I watched it the more I got out of it. I particularly love the way that the the ""good guy/bad guy"" roles are challenged, often reversing their ""assumed"" role. The thing that vaults this film to the top, for me, was the religious undertones. The REAL story here is one man's recognition of God's role in his life and his choice to accept God in his life. That was not obvious to me the first time I watched it but the message was hiding in plain sight. There are many other reference to God, demons, and angels but you have to look through the basic plot. Nothing is obvious."

It also features critically acclaimed actors such as John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth and a slightly disturbing cameo from Christopher Walken If you've watched this then you should also watch Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2., Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained. Fortunately for all Tarantino fans there will soon be a new movie out called The Hatefull Eight, once again featuring Samuel L. Jackson (of course). Also if we are lucky a Kill Bill Vol. 3 will be released at some point in the future."

There is so much in there, with the movie references and everything, you can catch something new each time.  Nobody does the comedy violence combination like Tarantino"
4 August 2014,lucax,0,0,10,This IS a tasty burger!,"Writer/director Quentin Tarantino demonstrates his encyclopedic grasp of filmmaking by bending, chopping and deconstructing narrative while keeping a groovy beat. Brilliant and brutal, funny and exhilarating, jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet.All the details are executed to perfection. Ironies abound in the smallest situations.The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel, a little bit tiring, a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers. The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers."

And that's exactly what it is. Some bullsh*t stories about hired assassins, bondage,...and some real hard language :p This movie doesn't need character backgrounds or depth in the dialogues, what it needs is exactly what it's got. I'm sure we all talk about our pasts or some philosophical sh*t when we're with our colleague on the way to work, especially when our work is wacking people. Or maybe we need some flashbacks of Vincent Vega's youth to understand his profession...like he got abused by his daddy or something. Come on...and as for the acting and the direction: are you guys blind? The shot when they come out of the elevator, down the hallway to the door, to the back of the hallway, back to the door. That's like a 5 minute shot about a footmassage, it's godd*mn brilliant! That is definitely not bad acting nor bad directing. Although I have to admit there are far better directors than Tarantino. He'll never get to the Kubrick or so level but he gets the job done. And a very nice one too."

Whether it's Miserlou or Jungle Boogie by Kool and the Gang, the soundtrack CD is a must have.The performances are great. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel are all memorable characters but the one that shines the brightest in this movie is Samuel L, Jackson. Every scene he's in, I get shivers down my spine.But the aspect that makes this movie what it is today is the dialogue. Only Quentin Tarantino could have pulled off something like this. It feels so natural and there is many references to pop culture of that decade.I'm warning you: this movie isn't for everyone. I know many people who didn't like Pulp Fiction due to its long dialogue scenes. But once you will finish the movie, you'll be quoting it all day longThe ending was good too. You and you're friends will be debating in the same fashion as other movie like Inception or The Dark Knight Rises.So overall, It's a great movie if you lay back and enjoy the dialogue10/10 (Classic)"

This all-star cast, Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), Samual L. Jackson (Star Wars) and John Travolta (Face Off) deliver their career best performances in this violent, language loving thriller.

Godfather 2.Godfather 2 3. Platoon 4. Pulp Fiction 5. Silence of the Lambs 6. Goodfellas 7. LA Confidential 8. Saving Private Ryan 9. Forrest Gump 10. French Connection
Pulp Fiction is about a 2 hitmen, a boxer, a mob boss, his wife and their intertwining stories. John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Uma Thurman all are brilliant (all got oscar nods)along with Bruce Willis and Ving Rhmaes in the movies main roles. Other lesser characters also shine such as Tim Roth, amanda plummer, Christopher Walken, and my personal favorite character in the movie Harvey Keitel as ""the wolf."" This movie has many stars but the true star of this movie is Quetin Tarantino. Quentin received a best screenplay oscar for his amazing story and his even better dialouge. In this non-linear film, the humor is top-notch. Quentin also connects this movie with the first movie he directed, Reservoir Dogs, and many otehr past movies.By using humor, music, great actors, and the best dialouge in any movie ever Tarantino creates one of the best movies ever made and in my opinion sets his mark as the best director ever. There are otehr great directors such as Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, Stone, and Scorcese. However, Quentin is his own star in his movies and when you say Pulp Fiction i associate Quentin with the movie, not any of the fantastic actors or actresses who starred in this film.Overall i give this movie a 10 out 10 and higly suggest that you see many, many times."

The reason I put it #1 is because I just think that the story is so unique, and wonderful. The characters are fun (and fun-ny) and deep. The character development is perfect. The cast and acting is perfect (with the exception of Tarantino playing Jimmy, but I don't count that). And the way that the story unfolds is perfect. What can I say.. it's a perfect movie. I could go on and on, but i'll stop there.Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie. Perfect 10."
27 October 2003,methx,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction is a brilliant film on more levels than just one,"First thing's first when it comes to a movie like Pulp Fiction, or any GOOD movie for that matter. Being a movie buff myself, I can't stress enough to people to actually listen to the dialogue in a movie, and pay attention to what's going on! Some people that have seen this movie dislike it because all they see is some violence and crude language. A few of these such people I have taken it upon myself to force them to watch it again and this time WATCH it. Needless to say, they now think it's a great movie.Pulp Fiction is basically the events that take place over three days involving two hitmen, a ganglord and his wife, and a boxer. First of all, I must praise Tarantino for his brilliant directing and writing, the way he pieces the story together is superb, his use of ""time jumping"" has never been utilized better. I must also acknowledge what most people appreciate about this movie, that it perfectly displays realistic reactions to extreme situations, or ""hyper-realism."" But what I love most about Pulp Fiction is how the plot develops because of the characters, rather than because of the situations that are presented before them. The characters themselves lead the story to where it goes, because of their characteristics, a rareity in many movies. Despite the fact that I believe without Tarantino this movie would not be nearly what it is, the cast is dynamite. Samuel L. Jackson definatly takes best actor for this movie, and although John Travolta perfectly nailed his part, Jackson simply had a more dramatic role and therefor leaves more of an impression. In the last scene Jackson is brilliant, and Tarantino could not have written a better ending to a superb movie. Pulp Fiction is a brilliant combination of ""Tarantino style"" with a ""Murphy's Law"" theme thrown into the mix. It's hard to even describe why I think Pulp Fiction is so great, so much symbolism can't be described in only 1000 words, but all I can say is that this is my favorite film of all time, and is well deserving of such a title."
7 November 2003,georgewareham,0,1,10,Praise for the film's greatness!,"You could tell Quentin Tarantino was going to be something special after watching his first masterpiece- Reservoir Dogs. Anybody who has watched any of his later work -Jackie Brown or Kill Bill will know that his films are top class. They are undoubtedly some of the best films ever made. However Pulp Ficton is just a work of pure genius. It is definitely my favourite film, and I do not know of anyone who dislikes it (although anyone who doesn't like violence may want to stay away from this one!) The cast, the script and the directing are near perfect and the storyline is out of this world! I believe that Tarantino has shown pride in perfecting this film, he even has exactly the right music. If you haven't seen this film-see it! If you have seen it then I'm sure I don't need to tell you to see it again!"

                        ",Superb Movie!,This movie just rocks! It's not a regular gangster movie because it shows you that gangsters are not always serious and dangerous like in every other gangster/mob movie. 'Pulp Fiction' shows you that also gangsters are regular people by making stupid mistakes and chit-chats that you and I could make. The conversations about a 'footmassage' and 'the charmes of a pig' are examples of the chit-chats that makes the movie on a differently way funny. But there are much more things what makes 'Pulp Fiction' a high standard movie. I just recommend you to watch it and to get convinced by the 'Tarantino' elements in the movie. Those elements could be very surprising although!!! for the ones who didn't see it(and planned to watch it); Have a lot of 'Tarantino' fun!
16 February 2004,Script_Writer_Extraordinaire,0,1,10,"So many, many elements","So many, many elements. Rarely does a director (Quentin Tarantino) come along with a film like this... and even rarer does a director resurrect a career with an amazing role and performance. First of all; the cast. With one containing Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kietel and John Travolta (with a cameo from Christopher Walken), it's evident the script must be amazing to attract such caliber.Pulp Fiction has revolutionized film making, making it in a lot of people's eyes the best movie ever. The characters interact so well, you think they are real people. Jules Winnefield, Samuel L Jackson's character, is one smooth talking, smooth walking, smooth shooting gangster. He really brings the film to life, and his own personal quest takes on many levels. His partner, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is equally hip, and has to take the tempting Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) out on a date. Thurman puts in a great performance, with a character deep, quick and (like most others in PF) the definition of cool.Bruce Willis is Butch Coolidge, the hard nosed boxer. He looks very much like his name suggests, although apparently because he's American; ""Our names don't mean shit"". His story includes the legendary Walken. However, it is how all these stories bind together so well which makes this movie magical. So seemless and easy, with amazing dialogue, seemingly about nothing important but so intruiging. The original style it is filmed in (non chronoligical order) makes it stand out as a film that will be copied for years to come.The film is strongly supported by another story, with Tim Roth's performance as the typical English villain. There is never a dull moment in the film that breaks and creates rules, and if you haven't seen this film, a) where have you been?! And b) buy it. now.This truly is the greatest film ever."
23 February 2017,claud_leonm,0,0,10,One of the few movies you never get tired of,"No matter how many times I've watched Pulp Fiction, it still surprises me.

26 March 2017,Serafim_k,0,0,10,Great,"The least interesting thing about Pulp Fiction is what is in that bloody briefcase. Whether it is unlimited moolah, the soul of Crime Lord Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) or the gold lame suit worn by Val Kilmer's Elvis in True Romance (1993) really misses the point of Tarantino's molotov cocktail of a picture. Making a mockery of the difficult-second-film cliché, Tarantino weaves a patchwork of crime film history into something shiny and new. Peppered with great moments eaten up by actors working at the top of their game (Travolta, Willis and Thurman have never been better, and the film created the aura of greatness that currently surrounds Jackson) Pulp's witty writing, pop culture-surfing, gleeful amorality, cult tuneology and hyperkinetic energy has redefined the crime genre for the foreseeable future."
5 February 2004,Spoonie_Gee,0,1,10,What can i say?,"For those who have never seen Pulp Fiction, I will put it plain and simple... Greatest Movie Ever!The plot is simple but oh so effective. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are two hitmen, who work for the big boss (Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis play Butch Coolige a washed up boxer and the sexy Uma Thurman play Mia Wallace, the big boss' wife.The way all of these characters interact with each other is what makes the movie so enjoyable. The fact that you can watch someone being shot in the face and laugh uncontrollably is amazing. No director has been able to revolutionize the way we watch violent films like Quentin Tarantino.The real star of the film is Samuel L. Jackson who plays Jules Winfield. This is the first movie of it's kind, where a character can the the ""F"" word so many times and still have so much dignity. He is not only incrediblly funny, but he is also a powerful figue in the film, changing his attitude from one extreme to another, whilst remaining hilarious. Bringing washed up actors back from the dead has also been a trait of QT's (Pam Grier - Jackie Brown, David Carradine - Kill Bill). John Travolta went from a B-grade actor to one of the most recognisable and entertaining actors in the world. His dance scene with Uma Thurman is so funny, you wont stop laughing for hours. Uma Thurman also plays her role spectacularly. Also not quite as strong as in Kill Bill, her character is more deep and required more attention than the Bride in Kill Bill. The big man himself, Tarantino, also makes an appearance as Jimmy from Taluca Lakes. Many people criticise his role as Jimmy, but I personally found his performance to be hilarious. The way his character worked with the Wolf (played by Harvey Kietel) was exceptional. After watching this amazing movie, you will want to watch it every chance you get. You will never get enough of the hilarity of Samuel L. Jackson's character, or the genius film-making techniques of Tarantino. If you have not seen this film, go and rent it, actually dont do that!!! GO BUY IT (so you can watch it over and over and over again)!!"
9 February 2004,Quentin_Tarantino,0,1,10,A Real Rarity,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that only comes around so often. Either you love it or you hate it. The storyline is not in chronological order, so most people will need a second viewing to fully understand it. I have seen it many times, and I keep finding new things with each viewing. This is the sign of a good movie (in certain respects, of course). The acting is SUPERB, the dialogue is funny, and the storyline is very clever. The only flaw is that it is over a lot of people's heads. People get confused, they miss the subtleness of facts & humour, and of course some simply dislike the gore (as little as there is) and the general crudeness of the dialogue. However, these are all essential to give off the impression that Tarantino wanted. He immerses you in this world where every character is different and unique and you can see the viewpoint of every one. It is an amazing movie, and everyone should watch it at some point."
20 September 2016,mattallencomedy,0,0,10,A perfect mix!,"This is the second film from Quentin Tarantino and it is simply amazing! It's a perfect mix of drama, comedy and violence. The film keeps you engaged with each character extremely well with the way the narrative is done and by the time the credits roll I guarantee you will be getting the soundtrack as it is absolutely kicks ass. The film is definitely not for the faint of heart as the violence when it happens is quite intense (but if you didn't know that already you obviously have never heard of Quentin Tarantino), however the violence isn't the point of the film and its used in good measure. It's a definite must for anybody's movie bucket list! Go watch it now!"

The lines are memorable, the action tense and in your face. I was addicted watching this film for the first time, and I still can't stop watching it.

8 September 2012,mindfullofspoilers,0,1,10,The perfect masterpiece.,"This movie is my personal favorite, along with The Dark Knight Rises, but there's something about Pulp Fiction that I can't put into words. It combines action, crime and a bit of comedy almost perfectly. I can't see any other cast than this one; every actor fits its character beautifully, specially Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. The movie isn't chronologically ordered, which, in my opinion, makes it better because of the mystery it creates. Anyway, you realize, at the end, that you spent 154 minutes watching an excellent movie and you don't regret it. Tarantino really managed to create a masterpiece, even better than his first movie Reservoir Dogs. I recommend this film to any movie lover or aficionado.TL;DR - Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies you'll ever watch."
18 November 2012,joe_qpr,0,1,10,very good masterpiece of a film,"Pulp fiction is Quentin Tarantino's master piece. It is his follow up film from his first big screen film Reservoir Dogs. Which was a splendid film just like Pulp fiction but unlike Pulp Fiction all it has is small actors (except Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth, who also starred in pulp fiction as Mr. wolf and honey bunny). Tarantino's new master piece stars huge house hold names such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman. Pulp fiction won the Oscar for best original screen play, and the Palme d'Or, the BAFTA for best screen play and six other awards. Pulp fiction is cut up into different chapters at are all related at different points. It is a real original idea that had never been done before and by God was it a great idea. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (which is why he won the BAFTA for best supporting actor) they had great back and forth whether it was about a divine intervention from god or what they call a ¼ pounder with cheese in France! In my opinion Pulp Fiction is the best film of the year. The only reason it didn't win more than it has is because of that lovable idiot Forest Gump. Not many directors hit back as hard with their second movie but Quentin Tarantino has! Let us all hope that he continues this run of great films for years and decades to come like Ridley Scott has with Alien and blade Runner. Tarantino really develops the characters well in the end he has you loving the murders just due to some of the lines they use like Samuel L. Jacksons character Joules with ""say what again I dare you I double dare you motherf***UU**!"" I have no criticisms of the film it's my idea of a perfect film others may find it too bloody like his first film but not me and the majority of Tarantino fans it's what we have come to expect of the best director of our generation.

It is very funny in many parts and I like the part when Vincent does heroin while driving. That has to be the funniest thing EVAR! Two more lines. This movie has Uma Thurman in it.

One will see things that better up hold the story, this is an example of its complexity. Second and last, this film has some of the best acting I've seen in a movie. John, Uma, jackson, Ving, Willis, Tarantino, Keitel, Roth, Plummer, Stoltz, Arquette, and even Buscemi were awesome. This is and always will be my second most favorite film, under Kill Bill of course."
9 July 2014,eric-sam-hicks,0,2,10,Memorable and Stunning!!,"I can't tell you how many times I've watched this film. The dynamic between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta is one of pure beauty. Together they make the most bad-ass and cool ""do-anything"" dudes ever... the kind of guys you'd like to have a beer with but always be afraid of turning your back on.Tarantino just seems to have a way with ultimate shock value. One minute you're floating along on the journey and the next you get smacked up the side of the head... a new twist. Keeps you on your toes. Full of surprises. The writing is iconic. The style flows. And the sex is tangible. There are very few movies that I go back to time and time again but if you're like me and enjoyed Gladiator, Braveheart, Fight Club, etc... then this is definitely something you are gonna wanna watch. I just hope Tarantino never reads this review himself, he'd probably call bullshit on me.Enjoy!"
22 November 2016,calebasatterfield,0,1,10,Classic Tarantino,"This is an excellent film for any Tarantino fans. I myself am a huge Tarantino fan but can also recognize a dud when I see one. This one however is far from that. I think all of the actors and actresses put on excellent performances from the astonishing cast that was put together. You find yourself interested in all of the characters instead of one main one. It's a nice gritty film with sprinkled in comedy. There is one scene in particular that might be quite graphic for some but you should expect that from a Tarantino film, as many of his films contain something of a graphic nature or an offensive conversation. Still I believe this is Tarantino at his best."
13 May 2019,khaliloz160,0,1,8,Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); they're on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. They're as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travolta's career is a series of assignments he can't quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (""The car hit a bump!"") but he doesn't know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence that's funny and bizarre. She's the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. That's before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, ""YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D. to YOUR house, I'LL stick in the needle!"" Bruce Willis and Maria de Medeiros play another couple: He's a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesn't. She's his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesn't understand why they have to get out of town ""right away."" But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, ""Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge,"" and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walken's monologue builds to the movie's biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control.If the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. A lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: The characters say only enough to advance the plot. But the people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun. It also means that the characters don't all sound the same: Travolta is laconic, Jackson is exact, Plummer and Roth are dopey lovey-doveys, Keitel uses the shorthand of the busy professional, Thurman learned how to be a moll by studying soap operas.It is part of the folklore that Tarantino used to work as a clerk in a video store, and the inspiration for ""Pulp Fiction"" is old movies, not real life. The movie is like an excursion through the lurid images that lie wound up and trapped inside all those boxes on the Blockbuster shelves. Tarantino once described the old pulp mags as cheap, disposable entertainment that you could take to work with you, and roll up and stick in your back pocket. Yeah, and not be able to wait until lunch, so you could start reading them again."

                        ","""How do specific cinematic and dramatic elements bring out the literary elements (plot, setting, characterization, theme) of the film?""","In this movie, ""Pulp Fiction,"" different cinematic and literary elements were used to bring out the literary elements of the movie.  The director, Quentin Tarantino, did an excellent job of using different camera techniques and also drama techniques in order to make the story line stand out.  I believe that this is one of the best movies of all time, and this was accomplished through the use of cinematic and dramatic elements. When using the camera to express the plot, setting, theme, etc., the director performed many different actions.  There was an abundance of point of view shots and dolly shots.  In the scene where ""Marvin gets shot in the face,"" there is a point of view shot from Marvin's perspective and it shows John Travolta's character turned around facing the camera while sitting in the passenger seat of a car.  The camera uses this shot to show the objects in the front windshield moving and makes clear that the setting is in an automobile.  Another point of view shot that shows significance to the story is when Bruce Willis's character comes back to his house to get his watch and finds a gun on the counter.  When he sees the gun, the camera turns to the point of view shot where Bruce Willis's character is focusing on the weapon.  This shows that the gun has a significance and the scene becomes dangerous.  It thickens the plot of the story greatly.  The director also uses dolly shots to express the mood of the story.  When John Travolta's character and Uma Therman's character are dancing the twist, there is a dolly shot that moves around the characters in a circle.  This gives the effect that the camera and cameraman themselves are dancing.  The dance and dolly shots give off a positive mood and lighten up the movie right before it drops into Uma Thermans overdose. Quentin Tarantino also used many dramatic elements in order to advance the plot and setting.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters have a certain attitude radiating off of them even when they do not have any dialogue.  Their suits match as hit men and they both have extreme hair styles.  These dramatic elements bring out their characters and make a connection with the audience.  The director also uses music to set the mood of the movie.  While doing the twist, there is pleasant music to portray the mood as happy and there is no danger for the characters. The director did not only advance the plot with the story line, but he also used dramatic and cinematic elements."

                        ",Whoa,"i just saw this movie and i would like to say that it is awesome. Seeing many of Quenitin Tarantino's films, it is obvious that he has become comfortable with writing stories with separate subplots that interweave. That is his format for almost every movie, save his efforts in Kill Bill Vol. 1+2. anyways, the audience knows that the stories are going to interconnect at sometime, but they just don't know when and that is what makes pulp fiction so enjoyable. there was a comment that quentin Tarantino is not a good actor and i disagree with that. he is good for parts that require quirky people because let's face it, quentin Tarantino is about as quirky as you can get! he's comical in his small role, though i would agree with not casting him in a feature role. pulp fiction is an awesome movie because there are so many layers. did anyone else pick up on the 666 tattoo with Ving Rhames?"
18 July 2012,abhinandans-banerjee11,0,0,8,The process of story telling becomes most important than content of story.,"Crisped dialog and the short focal lengths of each period of the film composes the entire motion journey as a thrilled 154 minutes short story.I,personally felt the entire film as a single-story-film but certain breakdowns for the sake of designing it in a breakthrough format.Though in some sections the long dialog parts start to make monotonous the motion ambiance but thanks to Quentin for the crisped twists in them.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson usually mesmerizing on the floor.Samuel's present designed such a epic funky Hit-man ambiance while Travolta represents the suspense fragrance throughout the entire.Uma Thurman is stunning.Bruce Willis's silence designed dark suspense ambiance.Harvey Keitel's surrealist humor designs a tricky metaphor.Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are on their own.Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife and The Gold Watch sections are backbones of the film.The Bonnie Situation portion is so metaphorical indeed.Blowing up the face of Marvin,is so significant in contextual vision.Wolf's surreal characteristic stands for the social.Apart from these all,as film Pulp Fiction- shows how the process of story telling becomes most important than content of story...and it also tells how to break the convention!"
24 May 2013,tpowbutters-428-765217,0,1,10,The perfect movie.,"The plot is out of order. The characters are over the top. The dialog is vulgar. The violence is brutal. And the result is perfection.Never before have I watched a movie that I can consider ""perfect."" Movies usually contain a number flaws, while fewer ones contain a couple mistakes that can be shrugged off. But there is nothing wrong with Pulp Fiction. Tarantino made a flawless movie.To have a perfect movie, you need the perfect casting. John Travolta nails it as Vincent Vega. Travolta has made some questionable choices in his career, but taking this role resurrected his career and earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Samuel L. Jackson is the standout star of the movie. From quoting nonexistent Bible passages to explaining foot massages, his character of Jules is one bad-ass motherf****r. The rest of its all star cast includes Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth (who probably has the most underrated performance in the movie), Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken.The plot is told our of order, which just adds more thickness to the movie. This is not a movie where, when you watch it the first time, you can just sit back and relax. Tarantino's movies make you think and he does the favor of not insulting the audience's knowledge.The most interesting and intriguing part of this movie is the screenplay. In fact, every Tarantino movie can be singled out for screenplays. Pulp Fiction succeeds in transforming its characters into everyday people, who talk about sex, foot massages, hamburgers, television, the Bible, coffee, and watches (don't ask where it's been). Without a solid screenplay, a movie can fall flat. Tarantino's Oscar was well-deserved.Overall, I give Pulp Fiction a 10/10. If you haven't seen it, then I highly recommend it. If you have seen it, you have been a witness to cinematic gold."

26 June 2018,nicolaivasic,1,6,8,Overrated,"This movie is somewhat overrated. 
People generally seem to like this movie but they're doing it all wrong. I feel like people's comments about this movie, such as; ""it's a masterpiece"", ""this movie was great"" and Bruce Willis has a great butt"" are somewhat unfounded, lack basic arguments, scientific reesearch and should be directed towards more epic pieces of the cinematic history. Examples of such pieces would be; Mad Max: Fury Road and/or other movies that are completely perfect. We should be careful of throwing out such compliments toward overrated historic innacuracies such as Pulp Fiction and Schindlers List.
It is a good movie and it has alot of good qualities, but the main quality it has is that its overrated. Its not the best quality but it feels like its a fitting one, it being overrated that is.
Maybe one day Tarantino will make a sequel to this one (and maybe call it Pulp Fiction: Rise of the Gimp or maybe Pulp Fiction 2: Uma Thurman Unchained or even Pulp Fiction: Everybody be cool this is a Robbery) that won't be as overrated, but it feels unlikely since he is making perfect western movies at the moment that are completely UNDERrated.
To summarize, this movie is overrated and it will probably stay that way for a long time."
4 August 2014,Corbob1,0,1,10,One of the best movies by Quentin Tarantino,"This is a must-watch for any Quentin Tarantino. How have you not watched it yet? =) Seriously though, keep in mind there are some very violent scenes in this movie that are not OK for children. Please keep this in mind if you haven't seen it or have only watched the uncensored version.This film brings together Quentin Tarantino's skills to tell a story out of order. Many have tried to duplicate his style to this day. It's a masterpiece that you can watch over and over. Share it with all your friends! My girlfriend recently watched just the ending of the movie and was surprised to find, when watching it again start to finish, that she had no idea what happens to the main characters. She also was shocked to find how many ""big name"" actors were in it.As of writing this review, it's available on Netflix to stream online. If you still haven't watched this gem, do it without delay!"

13 May 2012,carlitosway-1,0,1,10,Quentin Tarantino is a God amongst Mere Mortals!,"For many conversations that have started with my friends asking Top Ten Movies of ALL TIME, I always have this movie in the Top 3 and that is only because there a couple of mobster movies that I like to place as one & two and they are The Godfather and The Untouchables but the race between the three is so tight!! I like to think of Mr. Tarantino as King Midas because for me, anything he touches turn to gold, at least in my mind!! And Pulp Fiction is his Magnum Opus!! First of all John Travolta owes him his career, John Travolta had fell off the Hollywood map of sorts before he catapulted him back into the Actor that is in demand now. Every character in this movie had a charming personality and could stand on their own merit to make their own spin off movies. As Quentin's evident and consistent style the soundtrack of the movie was eclectic and alluring, there isn't a single song in that soundtrack that I don't enjoy and I can honestly say that before this movie if I knew more than 2 of the songs it was probably a lot! The dialogue, THE Dialogue, OMG!! THE BRILLIANT DIALOGUE!!! This movie has some of the very best lines EVER, my friends and I will sit down and watch the movie and see how much more one of us knows than the other and every chance we get we quote the movie!! For those of you who live under a rock and have never seen this movie you will find that it stimulates your cinematic palate for the rest of your life or you simply don't get it, nor desire to and quite frankly I feel bad for the latter!! If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for!?!? And if you have seen it, it's time you see it again, then again, then again at least 100 hundred more times, for me it never gets old and i ALWAYS enjoy it beginning to end!! Thank you Mr. Tarantino for this Masterpiece!!!!!!"

                        ",Tarantino's world-creation,"""Pulp Fiction"" will stand as an example of the creative, life-embracing potential of cinema for generations. Tarantino has succeeded in relating a ""fiction"" to an audience that has perhaps expected something else: the relation of a set of ""facts"" in their taken-for-granted context. Tarantino has powerfully understood the potentially authoritarian position lent to a filmmaker with an audience that demands such simplicity, such servitude. The director of ""Pulp Fiction"" has not delivered a linear, appeasing plot or characters. He has, in a sense, created a world in which situations are not easily rendered in a series of simple cause-effect relationships. The chapters of his story come as he wishes to give them; this is ultimately an act of respect for his audience, allowing them to enter his world and imagine the possibility of their own creations.Elements of this film remind me of Gary Walkow's 1995 film ""Notes from Underground"", based on the Dostoevsky novel, which is, fortunately coming to DVD in September. The Underground Man in the story cannot but view his life through a lens; this self-consciousness undermines his humanity and creative possibilities. Walkow's brilliance is reflected in the act of effectively turning the camera on his audience, holding up a relentless mirror to society and its inevitable product: a completely sick, dehumanized, alienated individual. Tarantino combats the mundanity of this alienation in his film ""Pulp Fiction"" through his ability to relate a ""fiction"", seeing it ultimately for what it is: his own creation, which he can change and manipulate as he pleases. Both ""Notes"" and ""Pulp"" come highly recommended; they each invite the viewer to embrace his or her own agency."
19 October 2012,finephily2,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction,"Absolute CarnagePulp Fiction is a dramatic narrative of the lives of two diner armed bandits, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and two mobster hit men that unravel into four separate tales of violence and redemption. As the turn-of-events of each story unfolds, it starts with the beginning from the end of each individual story and ends at the beginning. A single bible quote, illegal drugs, pawn shop mayhem, and an unexpected robbery kept the viewers at the edge of their seats. The film successfully attempts to correlate all four story lines simultaneously. I believe it was the intention of the writer Quentin Tarantino, to depict the characters of their completely different life styles. I think Tarantino wanted to show how different each lifestyle was, but they all had one thing in common. They all thought that they were the most powerful entity in the stages of the game, but they found themselves vulnerable to others. The crime boss thought no one was more powerful than he, until he got caught up in the pawn shop mayhem. Feeling very much in control and powerful, the hit men had a mishap and found themselves controlled and powered by another. The gangster's wife felt she was powerful by being married to the crime boss, but she lost her power by her illegal drug habits. From a direct order from the crime boss, the boxer chooses to ignore the directions thus, showing his power. His power was taken away as soon as he did not fulfill the deal. The two diner bandits had the power of a handgun, but soon lost their power when meeting up with the hit men with guns pointed at them.I found a couple mistakes in this movie in which I believe there should have been more accuracy. Recitation of the bible quote, Ezekiel twenty-five, was not quoted accurately as it is written in the bible. The Acura that Mr. Wolf drove was a two seat vehicle and he invited his girlfriend to breakfast and offered to give the hit men a ride home. How is this possible? I often wondered how a hit man for a crime boss could leave his gun in the kitchen of the steak-out house and use the restroom! I found the film unique, challenging to watch, and written well."

10 November 2012,wiegerstroo,0,1,10,"Pulp Fiction, just an awesome film","Pulp fiction, maybe with one or two exceptions the most famous film Quentin Tarantino made. Am I right in assuming that everybody who can read has seen this film? If I'm not and you haven't seen this awesome film you should probably stop reading this article now and just go see it!The film is based on three stories, the story of two robbers who decide to rob a restaurant, the story of two gunmen who are working for a powerful mobster called Marcellus Wallace, and the story of Butch a boxer who doesn't only play for the game. Although the story lines can be somewhat vague, and the stories aren't exactly chronological the film has a drive in it that will get you hooked from the first second.Quentin Tarantino is very well known for his violent scenes, the graphicness of his shots and his referrals to other films. In this film he shows his graphical insights and love for other movies again and again. His love for the f-word is demonstrated as well as his love for violence in films as it plays a very prominent role in this film because of the characters who are all involved with the underground in Los Angeles.Overall this film really is a must see, it's just so awesome. I can't put it in other words, it's awesome."
19 June 2005,QTFilmFan,0,1,5,Pulp Fiction,"The second film from the auteur named Quentin Tarantino proved to many individuals around the world that he is a filmmaker with style and energy, among many other things. This film was the first that I had encountered of QT's, a friend told me to check it out and to put it simply, I was amazed. At the time, I wasn't much of a cineaste at the time but right off the bat I was intrigued at every aspect of the film. QT's direction, writing, the acting, cinematography, editing (Sally Menke is fantastic, I'm glad QT and her have that bond like Thelma Schoonmaker and Marty Scorsese) The use of music. For a film that runs at 2 and a half hours, it whizzed by real fast because of its slam bang pace and style.

6 January 2015,qwinisabelle93,0,1,10,Great movie,"Definitely worth watching again I would say. Although it was released 1994, the storyline and the acting were good. This movie is a mixture of humour and violence. Though the plot and storyline does not really go smooth in a way. There happened to be those intersecting story lines in this movie but that is how it attracts the people to watch it, isn't it? The dialogue and lines in this movie are priceless. They were so good and you can't seem to get it out your head. I specifically enjoyed the part where Uma Thurman comes into picture. I liked her since the movie Kill Bill. She is beautiful and she has shown her talented acting portrayed in this role. And Samuel L Jackson, which I do not really have to elaborate. He has this unique way of making appearance and playing a role that no one would be able to forget his role."
5 October 2015,gogoenriques,0,2,10,Second greatest film of all time,"In my opinion Pulp fiction is the best written film of all time. Pulp fiction started out as what was supposed to be four different shorts, all put in one movie, each directed by a different filmmaker. Four Rooms is an example of this. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino came up with the idea of melting all the short movies together to make one, and let me tell ya, it was the best decision he's ever made to date. Pulp Fiction isn't only a landmark in cinema and film history it is also one of the greatest examples of pop culture. The music is another element that makes this movie great. Quentin Tarantino has said that in movies he looks forward to the moment when the music in a scene is blended to it. According to him, and to me, music should't just escort a scene, it should't just serve the purpose of not letting the audience feel bored during a long romantic/existential scene. The music should be part of the scene, meaning that if the music isn't there neither is the scene. An example in the movie is Surf Rider at the very end. Personally Pulp Fiction is my favorite film, at the same level of Outrage by Takeshi Kitano. Many have compared the two great directors because of their great use of violence in their movies. I don't agree, personally they are opposite and that is why I like them. Yes, they both use violence, but in completely different ways."

                        ",Pulp Fiction,"A brilliant film. Tarantino uses a simplistic technique for allowing his characters to evolve and reveal themselves, yet it is the context in which he puts them (and by context not only do I mean the scene, but the relation dynamics between other characters in the scene) that allows him to create deeply interesting, powerful and generally entertaining characters. All with their own idiosyncrasies, and often alluding humorously to societal stereotypes he creates a reality, which so often transcends upon us in the mundane of our societies. Tarantino demonstrates movies should be just as much about the verbal aesthetics rather than the visual through his eclectic dialogues, and the way many of his characters are founded upon an accent and a specific manner of speech (diction etc). Arguably, in our contemporary societies, the quality of dialogue (and verbal elements generally) has begun to diminish as a result of our new technologies and obsession with visual effects. Pulp Fiction, for me, is a way of returning to my real understanding of good films: a sophisticated fusion of excellent visuals, plot and (let's not forget) dialogue."

Very clever to show how the characters were so detached from their real work. So many surprises.Mia and Vincent: what was the motive of Marcellus to throw those two together knowing there would certainly be an attraction? A test perhaps...Loved Samuel L. Jackson epiphany...Interesting how the conversation between Honeybun and #### seemed so ordinary and then we wait for their drama at the very end.Those who live by the sword, die by the sword.

27 December 2012,markbekker1998,0,1,10,Must. See. Film,"The acting is brilliant. The dialogue and screenplay are probably the most creative I have seen of any movie ever. And frankly, the film just works. The characters work so well with each other and the various scenes fit so perfectly with each other. Every second and every line in that movie just seem entirely necessary and equally amazing. Typically, when I watch a movie, I tend to pick out flaws or things that I think could have been done better. I found none of that in this film, it's perfect. It simply brings tremendous pleasure to watch it over and over again. It is a masterpiece in film history and my personal favorite movie of all time."
20 February 2016,hobbylos96,0,0,8,"I don't understand it, but I feel that this movie is really special","As someone who hasn't seen that many movies but knows a bit about literature, arts etc. I can definitely admire most of the movie. I see why this movie has become so important for cinematography. Besides, it is also enjoyable to watch, some scenes are just straight out funny in their own and odd way. Still, I can't really get into a flow when watching the movie, there is no magic taking place for me like it is with the best of the best movies. This is probably due to a lack of knowledge on my part but also owed to the fact that the movie is not made to be the most entertaining one, but rather to show what is possible when it comes to narration style and combining different style elements. So in summary: You won't get bored watching the movie, you sort of have to have seen it and you will definitely realise that this movie is a piece of art, it is however, a different question to what extend you can admire that. Hence the 8/10, for me the movie should be a bit more plot driven to get 9 or 10 stars, but of course it was intentionally decided against that"
25 January 2013,PulpFictionist,0,1,10,"If you're reading this, you need to see this movie","A positively rapturous and sublime cinematic experience. The acting, directing and dialogue crackle across the board and shine throughout, and the nonlinear narrative is as consistently compelling as it is complex (and innovative!). Quite simply, an artistic masterpiece, a cultural watershed and a career-defining (and shining) effort from a directorial savant. Never before, and possibly never again, will humor, violence and redemption blend so effortlessly--and quite so stylishly--together. An absolute must-see, must-own film for any and every moviegoer. In this man's humble opinion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have ever seen."

13 February 2013,farmertravers,0,1,9,Think you know what a great film is? Think again.,"I suppose by now you've already guessed that this is going to be a rather positive view, but I just cannot get across how good this film really is.As long as you're prepared to experience scenes of sex, drugs and extremely bloody violence, as well as ridiculously excessive amounts of profanity (apparently the F word is used 265 times), Pulp Fiction is a film you can watch again and again and again. First time viewers, I guarantee the exotic blend of humour and action intricately woven into a brilliantly bizarre storyline will leave you more than satisfied. The superb acting, courtesy of a cast list adorned with talent, paves the way through the intriguing plot certain to captivate every fibre in your body. 2 hours and 34 minutes well spent, to say the least.But then your journey through Pulp Fiction is by no means over. Watching it time after time reveals a multitude of subtle hints left by the man behind the magic, Mr Quentin Tarantino. There is much more to this film than meets the eye, which is yet another reason why it is so good. Honestly, if I could shake the hand of anybody in the world, it would be the hand of Mr Tarantino, for bringing the world such a stunning film, whether or not he knows what the word 'chronological' means."
21 July 2013,mrblonde999,0,0,10,"A phenomenal film, with outstanding thought out structure.","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that gets to you every time you watch it. This film is hands down one of the greatest icons in the film industry. It structures out a plot through different stories at different occasions and brings a one line connection throughout the whole story. Tarantino is not only my favorite film director, but one of the most skilled at what he does. He provides an edgy plot with violence and references that happen in real life. Although Pulp Fiction may be far fetched from actual reality, but it still is a realistic fiction piece. The characters are well formed and controversial and has distinct personalities throughout. This film is by far my favorite and one of the most well written pieces the world has seen."
1 February 2014,bubweiser07,0,0,10,Best of its time,"Quentin Tarantino has one the most brilliant minds ever. Not only does he make great movies, but he always finds a way to keep you interested in whatever it is that going on... exception ""Jackie Brown"" which is a review I'll save for a day when I have time to complain about how awful it was..... So as I was saying Tarantino is a brilliant and I think the way he lays the story out in this particular movies couldn't have been any better. He had the perfect cast to pull of what I believe to be the best movie of that particular year. I honestly thought when I first saw this film that Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta were going to be a horrible match side by side, but the scenes with those two are what made me love the movie so much. Willis and Rhames scenes were great too... the situation they were in was kinda effed up, but none the less entertaining. The only time I lost any interest in this movie was when Uma Thurman had her moment of glory, but when she overdosed it kinda pulled me back into what was going on... weird I know, but back to my point the movie was great and I give it a 10/10. I know this isn't a great review, but I'm not good at this kind of stuff so bite me."

15 September 2016,wmmachado,0,0,10,One of Quentin's top masterpiece.,"This is one of the best movies of Quentin Tarantino, even though all of his movies are beyond excellent to me, this one in particular and Reservoir Dogs are the top of the list. Can go wrong with the cinematography and the intense gripping dialogue. What a genius. Great storyteller. Editing in the movie is also great, coincidentally Quentin Tarantino uses the same video editor for most of his films, the lovely Sally Menke, may she rest in peace. Unfortunately during 2010 she passed away during a hike at the Griffith Park in Los Angeles, he last movie she edited for Inglorious Bastard 2009. In 1994 she was Nominated for – Academy Award for Best Film Editing – ACE Eddie for Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic and BAFTA Award for Best Editing in Pulp Fiction. While in 2003-04 Kill Bill gave her four other nominations and two big wins in Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Best Editing and San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Editing. Regardless Quentin Tarantino is the real man of the hour with over one hundred twenty wins & one hundred sixty six nominations and Two Oscar Awards."
23 August 2013,brasher-tom,0,1,5,It was OK.,"I watched the movie with my mate expecting to watch the best movie I have ever witnessed in human history, after watching shaw-shank redemption with the same friend we thought that pulp fiction would be the same experience. We were wrong.Pulp was an OK movie the beginning since with the big mac was half decent but not something to get too excited about, personally i believe this movie is unbelievably over hyped. The restaurant scene was very dull and nothing much happened. I tuned out during the boxer talking to the boss scene and just gave up after the boxer left the ring and ditched his boss to find his girlfriend. The movie was OK, i know I will receive abuse from people saying that I am an idiot but it is my opinion and I an entitled to it, but I can kinda understand why people like it so much. Brasher."
21 June 2014,relaxingend,0,1,10,Best Movie in the last 20 Years?,"Since ""Pulp Fiction"" was released in 1994, there has arguably not been a better film made. It is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's rating of a 9.0 is well-deserved on IMDb. Without spoiling anything, I'll try to keep this concise. It has some of the greatest acting, dialogue, and direction you'll ever see in a film. Some people complain about its length, but I was entertained the whole way and the viewing went by quickly. (At the end you'll be begging for more!) I've seen several films from director Tarantino, and this is probably his best work, though ""Reservoir Dogs"" comes close. The movie is mostly a character/dialogue movie with interesting twists, but it includes top-notch action and violence every so often, adding to the entertainment value. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis give some of the best performances in their careers. Other notable performances include Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames, with much smaller roles. The movie redefined cinema and has been replicated since, but never duplicated. The storytelling was through multiple characters and their different stories and experiences intertwine into a big cluster of madness and excitement. Also, the story is not told in a linear fashion. Many memorable scenes and quotes are also contained in this film. Many things have been said about this masterpiece by others so I'll leave it at that."
1 April 2013,trade-648-481770,0,1,9,My all time favorite.,"Pulp Fiction was the first movie that I brought on DVD. I think that it will go on to become a cult film as it has so many classic lines and different levels. It can be pure entertainment or it can be viewed as a cut across 1990's America. A Tarantino fan I am. Pulp Fiction ( which I watch at least twice a year) never gets tiring as there are so many areas to explore, so many visual nuances to catch the eye every time you watch it. The sound track in itself is amazing in the way that it brings scenes into focus. Tarantino again shows that CGI will never replace storyline, acting and excellent directing. Pulp Fiction is the sort of movie that any movie lover should see at least once from their bucket list."
11 April 2015,psalmv128,0,1,10,This is One of the Best Pieces of Work I've Ever Seen!!!,"Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."

                        ",Bad review,"""...characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring..."" You apparently missed the deeper plot where the briefcase holds the soul of Marsellus Wallace. (The band-aid on his neck is apparently where it ""came out"" and the combination to the briefcase is ""666"", further showing he sold his soul to the devil) Ill agree it wasn't the best plot-driven movie, but there are worse movies out there. I just hope people arnt or weren't influenced by your review as it was lacking in any real view on the movie. There are always deeper stories than the bright pictures you are seeing on the screen. Granted, they do make movies sell, but its usually whats inside that makes it a good movie."
13 April 2014,maudrius10,0,1,10,This is a very good film.,"I normally don't write reviews for the films that i have seen, but Pulp Fiction was so good that i decided to write one for it. I usually don't watch movies that are over 20 years old but this one was special. The plot was all mixed up and the story is in a point of view of different characters. Bruce Willis, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson star in this film and they are among my favourite actors. This movie contains a lot of adult scenes but I believe that I am mature enough. Even though I am only 15 years old, I understood the storyline and I really enjoyed watching this film. That is what makes this movie original and that's why I recommend this movie to anyone."

I find something new every time I watch it.Whether it be for its amazing dialogue, flawless direction, intriguing characters, or just flat out raw brutality and excellent film-making, pulp Fiction, in my mind, stands out as the greatest film in the history of cinema."

31 July 2013,Jorobo96,0,0,10,Royale with Cheese,"Having never watched a Tarantino film before, I was recommended Pulp Fiction as an extremely striking and memorable film (and among the most quoted films of all time). Despite the initially confusing start with new characters and situations being introduced very quickly with no apparent connection with one another, I was completely sucked in to the darkly comic and often disturbing world. The All-star cast were all brilliant, especially John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, who bounced off one another to make genuinely believable partners in crime. The final scene is both fantastically acted and is one of the most lasting images of the film. Overall, it is a gripping and hugely enjoyable film (save for Tarantino's appearance!)."

The conversation at the movie's outset about burgers et al. having no relevance to the scene following it had made me doubt whether it's worth to continue any longer. One fine day, i watched it fully and my word, what a movie it is!The movie has a non-linear narration and that too with multiple plots that are related. The movie is great for it's artistic nature. It's not a movie for the conventional audience. The dialogs sometimes go out of relevance to the situation but that's been done deliberately. It has made the movie artistic and stylish.Excellent performances. Especially that of Samuel Jackson and John Travolta.Another great feature of the movie is it's excellent characterization. There are plenty of characters with defined-roles.

21 February 2016,Divinelink,0,2,9,Astonishingly Amazing,"It actually took me so long to watch this movie, even though it has be suggested to me so many times but for some reason I would not just watch it. And boy, I was so wrong. It is well known that Quentin Tarantino has done prodigious work over the years of his career followed up by Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill: vol 1 & 2 but Pulp Fiction is without a doubt his masterpiece. Now to the movie review.What I like most of this film is that it will keep you interested during the whole experience without the existence of unimportant scenes and characters, boring gaps in between the scenes and leaving no unanswered questions or plot holes. There are plenty of characters and with that said almost every viewer can associate with someone. During the movie you will experience a bunch of feelings: Sadness, pity for some characters, gross and laughter. Trust me on this one, you will LAUGH a lot. Especially with Samuel L. Jackson's acting and generally the conversations between them. Not only that though, some things said will make you appreciate life, question some things you may have in your life, decisions and principles leaving you at the end of it a better man or at least a skeptical one. To sum up, some good points of the movie:Realistic and moving conversations, check! Incredible acting, check!Interesting flow without getting bored, check! Music & soundtrack that fits the movie, check!It's a unique experience and I would recommend it to everyone, especially to Drama/Crime fans out there."
24 January 2005,mcloughlin_599,0,1,10,Quentin Tarrantino,"""Resevoir Dogs"" put Tarrantino's name out in the public and he raised a lot of eyebrows in 1992 or whenever it came out. ""Pulp Fiction"" came out two years later and silenced any who doubted Tarrantino's genius. Sure there were those critics who were jealous of his success, and others who simply didn't understand why the movie was such a smash. I remember seeing it when it first came out when I was in the 8th grade. From then to the present, I've seen the movie at ten times. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the best movie ever made. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every moment is crystal clear perfection. John Travolta and Samuel JAckson couldn't have -and never again will- have a better performances as the two gangsters who are part of some fictional multi raced gang in L.A. Bruce Willis is the boxer who's out to make money, but still maintains belief in some things like honour and posterity. Whereas other great gangster movies like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Scarface"" show you how these gangsters live and the struggles they go through, Tarrantino is able to show all that while going much deeper into the psyche of gangsters. As in the case of Travolta's character they can be sharp,dry witted, and stupid at the same time. HAnd there are several other great characters along the way. The time line of the movie is arranged in a circle where it ends in the same place it began. This works very well because Tarrantino clearly chose his scenes very carefully according to that time line idea. There is nothing that I can say to do justice to this movie. If you haven't seen it then you must because it may end up changing what you think about cinema forever."
8 December 2013,epibobby,0,1,10,Really great movie,"Perhaps the most recognized of Tarantino, and because film is a pure success. Found it difficult to fault this Pulp Fiction, which depicts the thugs like you've never seen. The cast? Just perfect. The soundtrack? Majestic. 3 craziest stories as each other, intertwined in such a fluid that flows brilliantly fast 2:30 narrative. Lightweight, funny, bad ass, and armored surprises. Tarantino we always balance a situation which is not expected. Dialogues? The best that Tarantino has ever done. I put 9 star in this film, but because for me, Pulp Fiction is part of the cream of cinema. The film you can watch again and again, a smile on his lips non-stop, and whose lines are so explosive that they must be reused in a conversation."

That is the first time that I enjoy dialog in a film without being too concern about the ""story"". The dialog is the drama itself, and Tarantino did it very well, a character also I found in his another film, Reservoir Dogs, which I watched later.I learned that Tarantino ever worked as a video rental employee that usually watched many films in parts, and the habit has set a particular way of watching a film. In the contemporary development of media recently, I think those fragmented, incoherent and pulpy forms of visual civilization has became more and more visible to us. And in that terms, Pulp Fiction has given a first sign of how life would be, and how we will live our life in this more and more fragmented, disjointed and rapid flow of information. In that sense, Pulp Fiction has been prophetic."

17 December 2013,CaptainSavaho,0,1,7,Classic Tarantino,"Everybody has an issue with dysfunction. Dysfunction with family, in the workplace, in social circles or elsewhere in their lives, but everybody in today's society suffers from some type of dysfunction. This film illustrates the very meaning of dysfunction. In looking at any one of the characters from the John Travolta and Samuel Jackson roles as professional hit men (Vincent and Jules respectively) to the head mobster and his wife, Marcellus and Mia played by Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman, all were drowned in dysfunctional issues. The highpoint of the film is that in comparison to your own situation at home where you looked at the familial relationships as being the pinnacle of microcosmic sociopaths, this film makes them appear as angels. I believe one factor that helped make this film come together was the dialog. The wit of Jules was expounded brilliantly.In essence this film appears to have three separate and distinct story lines - which helps those of us with ADD. There is the component of mystery. For example it was never revealed what was in the briefcase Vincent and Jules were sent to retrieve.While I have actually viewed this movie on more than one occasion, I am not certain I can narrow one single plot or story line as the primary. The theme of the movie was the social implications in a dysfunctional world. While this is a very loose association, I would think that the horror movie (series) Saw is the closest thing I can offer in suggesting thematic comparison.His (Tarantino's) use of props and shock value are two of the most important components to tie into the movie's theme. If I had to pick a third, it would be the creative dialog between the characters.The film did not follow a strict chronological sequence which, in keeping with the dysfunctional theme managed to work in the film's favor.Tarantino uses his now well-known knack for the dramatic to create and develop roles that are violent, mysterious, humorous and charismatic all at the same time. Somehow this movie fits together. The direction, cinematography, and editing work to make a film with apparent random scenes somehow mesh.This particular film is indicative of the mind of Tarantino. Anyone who has developed a liking of his style and inner goings-on will appreciate this work. It is destined to be a classic in the minds of movie buffs everywhere."

The plot is something you can even put your own twist to it. It's a must watch!If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't lived! The chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta have is undeniable. This movie is hilarious in an awesome way. Very awesome. This is the only movie I would give a 10/10. Its a cult classic !! Best movie Tarantino has ever made. My only regrets are watching this movie so recent. I wish I wasn't about a year old when it came out. Easily makes the list of top 5 movies of all time. This is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece."
8 January 2014,Steak-Sauce,0,1,10,Great,"This Film is one of my favorites, as I have seen many. The Viewer is taken on a ride as they witness 3 stories that revolve around the world of Marseilles Wallace. The journey they are taken on is great and unlike anything you've ever experienced. All I can say is that the only movie I've ever seen in my opinion that is better than this the Shawshank Redemption, a movie loved by almost all people. So if your in for excitement, then buckle up and hunker down, cause your in for a treat But this movie is not for all,as the graphic content might disturb some, but if you can handle it, I strongly recommend you witness the greatness that is Pulp Fiction."
12 April 2014,edgarmorenoventura,0,1,10,Perfection.,"This one is the movie. The first one, the best in all lists.Twenty years ago Pulp fiction was the first movie which moved me to watch it for 5 times at theaters, and no one had got it later.It's noir, it's comedy, drama, thriller. Is the rescue of celebrities, the homage to classics, the acting play as a game. One of these films you never get tired to watch, always can see new things. Tarantino is a creator, written in capital letters. A new language of time-line argument, a care-selected soundtrack, the perfection of a style started in Reservoir dogs. A ""show how"" of production management, with a few bucks is possible to make a masterpiece. The MUST ONE.Sorry for my English."
13 January 2014,dburnett0723,0,2,10,Outstanding,"Pulp Fiction's use of dramatic emotion and lust towards people you aren't supposed to lust after leads to trouble. This movie aced all expectations. I could not have been impressed any more from a Quentin Tarantino movie. Outstanding. This fit the right time period Tarantino was going after. The syringe loaded with adrenaline added a boost of nostalgia to the piece. Nothing could be changed about this film. Definitely worth watching. I have 3 copies myself! Keep up the good work Tarantino. Yes I am in love with this flick and will continue to keep it rated as my favorite of all time. From a fellow film student, this movie enlightens the cinematic experience."

20 February 2014,nunya2014,0,0,10,A MUST have modern era classic!,"Everything from themes, to dialog, to underlying storyline is a modern-day classic. One can watch this movie 10 times and come away with some new perspectives each and every time. Even the music is totally engrossing. SEE THIS MOVIE!A one time viewing is not enough. It's like an onion. Each viewing peels another level. And each new level reveals insights you didn't notice before. The film strikes deep emotions and introspective tones without being overly intellectual. You never feel like your sitting in a literature class, but nonetheless you find yourself diving deep into the characters.Most remarkably, it does all of this ""Deep Thinking"" while keeping a wonderful sense of humor. It's a real trick to be exploring these engaging powerful (and even violent) characters and yet keep you laughing too!Bottom line, it's like a 10 course meal with all different flavored levels that still manages to keep the watcher wanting more. A modern masterpiece!"
10 February 2014,p-ploskov,0,0,10,Best movie in the history of the cinematography,"One - word Tarantino! ! !In far 1994 as you know, there was a decent number of very interesting and qualitative movies, such as: ""Escape from Shawshank"" Frank Darabont, ""Leon"" Luc Besson, ""Forest Gump"" of Robert Zemekis. . Transfer of all these pictures can borrow much, it is a lot of lines, but it is most, from listed above, in my opinion, Quentin Tarantino's movie — ""Pulp fiction"". In due time this picture made furor, both on critics, and on film fans. The movie received the Oscar for the best scenario, was nominated for sets of awards and in general is recognized as one of the best criminal tapes, when or removed. Why — it received this rank? In my opinion it occurred from — for courageous approach to violence, impudent talks and the extraordinary scenario written by the director. Tarantino managed to make simply cult movie which it is possible to reconsider one hundred times of a weak and simple plot! To Tarantino anybody such didn't do anything, and infinite imitations from which I can distinguish ""Cards went then, the money, two trunks"" Guy Ricci and Barry Zonenfelda though even they near ""Reading matter"" are destroyed. About actors conversations are absolutely excessive, after all everything likely is already told to me. John Travolta, Sam Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and, great and awful Quentin Tarantino — everything coped with the roles unbelievable!My result ""Pulp fiction"" — the movie simply phenomenal, before it cheerful, interesting and extraordinary! Above any estimates."
10 January 2006,garydavidkiplin,0,1,10,Worth missing chemistry for!,"I first watched this film around a year ago. My friend brought it round to watch before our chemistry lesson in the afternoon. We knew Pulp Fiction was a long film, so we figured we would stop it after about an hour or so and watch the rest some other time (that way we wouldn't miss college!) What we didn't realise is how good the film is! There was no way we were leaving that room without seeing the film in its entirety. Needless to say we missed chemistry! The only thing to have ever made me miss a lesson at college except Scarlet Fever! I have to say it was the best film i had ever seen at the time and it remains on the top spot to this day and i expect every day for the rest of my life. Since that faithful day i scived off school i must have watched the film at least another 20 times. Every time has been worth investing 154 minutes. It raised the standard for any form of visual entertainment, Every film or program i have watched since has been compared to Pulp Fiction, which in a way is a bad thing! Nothing has ever lived up to that . film and i suspect nothing ever will, making most new films a disappointment. It has also made me far too critical of films, i can never see a good film, they are always ""quite good"" or ""ok"" but never Pulp fiction.This is for good reason though...IT IS FANTASTIC!"
13 February 2014,mockingbird04,0,0,9,One of the best movies ever made! Little things made that.,"When i first time saw Pulp Fiction i was amazed - how people could think that this is one of the best movies ever made. Of course nonlinear storyline, smart and specific dialogues and Samuel L. Jackson great acted character Jules Vinnfield was something that get my attention and i even thought: ""This movie is really good."" But that wasn't what critics said. Critics said: ""This movie is excellent!"" After some time i watched this movie again and i started to see some details that i had missed first time. Then i watched this movie third time, then fourth, fifth. And then i realize - those critics were right. This is one of the best movies ever made! Little things made that. You know, i don't talk about twisted plot or storyline itself. Just listen to conversations! What Mia told to Vincent before she goes to toilet, where she sniffs some cocaine? ""I'm gonna go to bathroom to powder my nose."" It's simple, but brilliant. Another example - before Vincent accidentally shoots in the face they informant Marvin, ""You think that God came down from heaven and stopped..."" (gun shot), he didn't even finished that question about that situation which Jules is so infatuated before Marvin is just another dead body. And these lines isn't most well known from this movie, the whole movie is full of mind tricks and ""wordplay in Tarantino way"". Every word in dialogues means something, even if it doesn't make sense. To say true it's only make sense for us - movie fans, but that's the point. Tarantino wouldn't made this movie, if it would be only for him. No, he wants to share his amazing mind, unique humor and deep thoughts with us. I am not really sure, if this is best movie ever made. I'm not sure even if this is best Tarantino's work or best crime movie in general, but this movie always will make you think, you always go inside characters brains in those tricky situations and you always be surprised, no matter how many times before you have watched it. If you are real movie fan and have mind and emotions, you cannot dislike this movie. The only problem - Tarantino sometimes is too smart for you!I hope you liked my review. This is my first serious movie review, but hopefully not the last. And sorry, if my English isn't perfect!"
20 February 2014,netlixmove-olic,0,0,8,A piece of artwork,"While the plot and story line didn't quite do it for me, the one thing I can say is that this movie was that Quentin Tarantino can make one heck of a movie. Even though I didn't thoroughly enjoy the movie's story, which I found confusing and choppy, the acting was an A+. The filming style reminded me a bit of Spike Lee just from a style standpoint that everything means something (yes I know how ironic that sounds). What was the most interesting part of the style of the film was the long scenes. They might actually of been some of the longest i'd ever seen a a movie. I felt as if this role was made for Samuel L Jackson and him alone, he often plays a role with similar actions and emotions. Another thing thing I did feel was missing was real character depth. Even though they had very dynamic personalities, which anyone could figure out, upon the 2nd viewing I realized I knew nothing about them. Yes, they had interesting action, but the motivation for these actions is unknown. For example Vincent Vega ( John Travolta's character) and his heavy drug use, why? People just don't turn to drugs he must of had some unknown internal conflict going on, that just went unspoken about. If you want to watch something that really captures your attention and you fall into love with he plot and characters don't watch this movie. If you want something that is though provoking and very artsy watch this. Everyone should watch this movie at least once."
16 February 2014,alexcarpenternyc,0,0,10,One of the greatest films ever made,"In the amazingly beautiful way Quentin makes this film come to life, it's hard to say this isn't one of the greatest films of all time. It's beautifully written and the musical score is absolutely perfect. In his stylish way of filmmaking he seems to make his audience feel as if they are actually there and leaves you wanting more. If this film was three more hours long I would love it even more. There isn't a dull moment throughout the film and not even the slightest moment of boring or not appealing themes or moments. It's non stop beauty and amazement from start to finish. You couldn't ask for a better movie going experience and this film will remain a classic for decades to come from audiences all around the world. Pulp fiction is the kind of movie you and your friends and family talk about and quote endlessly for years to come"

                        ","A fine, gritty, and fun film...","It's hard to gauge what Pulp Fiction means to me personally. In the world of cinema, however, Tarantino's film has been heavily influential; changing the language of American cinema in the 90's and onwards. Even today, PF's influences are everywhere. More than likely, you've seen homages to this film in many of the more recent films you see, without even knowing it.It's not hard to see why the film was (and still is) as popular and highly regarded as it came to be. It's hip, to say the least. The dialogue is hip, the characters are hip, the cinematic technique is hip. Though what PF has that other ""hip"" films don't, is a freshness. It's a relief from the standards and conventions of what cinema seems to have become. Tarantino tried to defy the laws of making a Hollywood picture, all while maintaining enormous commercial success.Pulp Fiction tells us four different stories. It follows two hit-men, a mobsters wife, a champion boxer, and two diner robbers. Their stories are intertwined out of typical chronological order.Tarantino's writing is absolute genius. He seamlessly moves in and out of story lines, weaving back and forth in time. It's never confusing, and relentlessly entertaining. Though much of the film consists of long stretches of character conversation (most of which has nothing to do with the plot), the dialogue is so realistically written that we get caught up inside of it. Silent observers of two people engaging one another. Tarantino's Oscar was well deserved.The cinematic technique is also quite fresh. The photography is close, gritty, and unflinching. The lighting is gloomy, and reflects a kind of magazine like feel (the film is inspired by pulp magazines). Tarantino pulls away from action, allowing us to observe all that is going on, but gets up close and personal during conversation, allowing us both viewpoints.The cast is superb. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play the hit men and strangely enough have a great chemistry. Their breakfast conversation is brilliant. Uma Thurman plays the mobsters wife, and though her part is short, it's quite excellent. Bruce Willis plays our boxer, and has the most demented story in the film, but he was great as usual. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are the robbers, who make their presence known despite their very short screen time. Other cast member include: Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino himself. The casting is stellar.I honestly cannot think of any flaws whatsoever. It works as a black comedy (and boy is it hilarious), a crime thriller, as well as having something slightly profound about it, though the film says nothing. It doesn't need to say anything; it's pure cinematic perfection. It's one of the greatest American films of all time.So, again, it's hard to say what about Pulp Fiction affects me personally. I appreciate it as a film milestone, but I also have a ton of fun watching it. It doesn't seem to get old. Though the film doesn't really have anything to say, it penetrated our culture in an interesting way. I think one could say that Pulp Fiction was the defining film of the 90's. Its influence still reverberates, even to this very day.Someone once called it a boy movie; it's not. It's a film lover's movie. It's entertainment at it's purest and most joyously crafted form.Maybe that's what it has to say. Maybe it's just there to remind us how perfectly visceral and downright fun cinema can be.""They call it a royale with cheese."" 10/10"
20 March 2015,NadiMilano,0,0,10,Best movie of all time,"A classic! One of the best gangster's movie, with great action and lots of blood. Just what you need to spice up your night. Pulp Fiction is though and cruel but also at times very fun and hilarious and always entertaining. There is no down moments and the adrenaline is kept high from beginning to end. I personally love Tarantino and the way he presents the story, always intricate and full of suspense. Another amazing component to the movie is without a doubt the soundtrack which is legendary and so appropriate. The cast is very strong, from Samuel L. Jackson to Uma Thurman to John Travolta every single character has its own reason to coexist with others. The movie was made in 1994 but is still so current and definitely a timeless piece."
25 April 2005,dcs3000,0,1,9,My first Tarantino movie,"Pulp Fiction The movie that made me discovered Tarantino and his directing style. The casting is awesome. Uma Thurman, although not my favorite actress, gets the job very well done. John Travolta was great acting Vincent Vega, a drug addicted gangster, so was Bruce Willis as Butch, a nearly retired boxer. They actually thought of Sylvester Stallone to act this part first Could have been good as well, thinking about his background acting as a boxer in the Rocky series, but the result with Bruce is just brilliant. My favorite character was for sure Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) who's the ""soul brother"" assassin type, colleague of Vincent Vega. He appears as a very knowledgeable guy who can talk about anything from religion to foot massage, while eating a burger with the left hand and shooting wannabe gangsters with the right handand don't forget the hair-style. He's a BAD man, and he's cool at it. Now the plot Well they kinda all have their own stories but it's all gravitating around the same thing. Vincent and Jules have to get back a case that was stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace Then things happen, they make several encounters that cause trouble or bring other characters in the mix But the best is the way Tarantino makes you discover the whole story. I won't discuss it here as it would spoil the fun for those who're gonna watch it for the first time. Just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.It's really worth your money and time in my opinion. I give it a solid 9 stars (wanted 10 but I thought nothing is perfect so)"

Its an iconic American movie, that so many other movies have tried to copy, but fall short.Some of the most memorable scenes ever, at least to me.The dance scene, gimp scene, and heroin scene are instant classics. Bruce Willis is also amazing in this. Sam Jackson can look at this movie as the movie that truly put him on the map.Just enough gore to satisfy me,and Christopher Walkin !!, what else do you need ?, I love Tarantino as a director, but his acting is very, very sub par.He should definitely leave the acting to the actors.Besides that, the movie is truly one of my favorite movies ever."

A great production and a great movie all around. Quentin Tarantino never fails to produce a great film. Some of my favorite all time scenes and movie quotes are from this movie. Some people love Tarantino, some people hate him, and others love to hate him. I am one of the people that loves him and the work that he does. I don't think that I would consider him a genius like some other might but I do think he is great at what he does and he has yet to disappoint me. Watch this movie!"
11 February 2017,johnstrubhart,0,1,10,Great Flick,"I found this movie to be very entertaining, engaging and satisfying. From the moment Travolta and Jackson's characters argue about the significance of a foot massage, the viewer is drawn into classic pulp fiction. It was excellently over the top with the dialogue and action. A Quentin Tarantino classic, this is a masterpiece of movie art and a great social commentary on America's love affair with violence. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta give their most excellent performances in this movie. Can you figure out what is in the briefcase? Let me know if you do. I'm dying to find out. If you like fast action, witty dialogue and over the top fight scenes, you'll love this movie Oh, and the music is great too. I highly recommend the soundtrack."

This is a great comeback roll for the likes of Bruce Willis and John Travolta. Uma Thurman does a magnificent job playing Mrs Neil Wallace. I love Quentin Tarantino's cameo appearances in all of his films. Harvey Keitel is a force to to be reckoned with. Shot on film this is a beautiful masterpiece. Bring out the gimp!

Moreover, Bruce Willies demonstrates the role of a strong man and will do anything in order to get what he wants. Upon being captured by rapists no doubt more than twice the enemy and save his life so continue showing his human side to have compassion for others. In conclusion I can say that Tarantino's film exposes nothing predictable parts and leaves you least expected surprise. At the time of joining to each character in the movie space time naturally demonstrates that the director's job professionally prepared."
25 July 2014,fercks,0,0,10,A masterpiece,"It is a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino arrives to Immortality. A different film language that had never seen. That said, Tarantino's twist on the pulp genre is also damn near a work of art. At 31, he shows a disdain for flashy style and lofty pretension. His passion is for storytelling that allows the most outrageous characters to reveal their feelings in long takes and torrents of words, poetic and profane. Pulp Fiction proves that Tarantino is the ideal director for preserving the verbal rhythm and wicked playfulness of his scripts. He revels in pop culture, especially that of the 70s, and he's no snob; The French New Wave or blaxploitation, The Wild Bunch or The Brady Bunch it's all grist."

For younger viewers, it may be confusing because it jumps around a little bit with the different stories of several people. (I wouldn't really recommend this for ""younger viewers"" though.) All of the actors did a very good job, and Quentin Tarantino did yet another stellar job of directing a movie. This movie contains MANY uses of the ""f"" word, among others, so if you are planning on letting your child watch this-- keep that in mind. I wouldn't recommend this movie for people who are sensitive to cuss words or other semi-controversial subjects. (As there are some references that may be deemed rather inappropriate to some viewers) There are some sexual parts that may make younger viewers uncomfortable, especially if watching with parents. All in all, I would rate the movie an 8 and I have seen it countless times and would have no troubles watching it again!"

                        ",Pulp Fiction Review,"Pulp Fiction is a dark comedy, which means the audience empathizes with the victims who are suffering while the comedy is used to mock the victim and belittle them throughout the course of his or her suffering. This is evident in the films eclectic dialogue, a mix of humor with violence. The small criminals or Los Angeles mobsters carry a mystery briefcase and use many conversations throughout the movie. Language used in the movie shows the sense of humor they share and the perspective they have on life. It emphasizes on blood, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, and (leather) freaks. The movie also uses narrative techniques that do not follow an intended pattern, and the movie is out of chronological order; each storyline focuses on a different series of incidents. In the movie, there was a part where Vincent gets prepared to stick a needle in a woman's chest who is suffering from an overdose. Stoltz freaks out and does not want to stick her with the syringe, so he tells Vincent to do it, because he took her. Vince hesitates for a little bit, talks back and forth with other characters, and then stabs the women in the chest, and she arises. Scenes like this make it a black comedy. In the odd movie film, it is a seemingly complete narrative, in which is chopped into pieces and rearranged like a puzzle. A gangster film has no police officers in it. It is a montage of bizarre characters, from a black mobster with a mysterious bandage on the back of his baldhead, to hillbilly sexual perverts, to a mob problem solver. There is a shot reverse cut used in the film to show the audience that the drug dealer was watching television and then, we see the TV, while showing the audience what he was watching. The film also used match on action when the car heads to the house, car goes out of scene, and then we can hear the car crash. The drug dealer comes out of the house and looks to see what happened, while the camera is showing us his vision, we then see what he sees, the car crashed in the side of the house, that is when the audience confirms what the crash was. There were quite a few techniques used in the film, I chose to highlight the adrenaline scene. I believe the editing found in the movie were appropriate because the cuts were not the greatest and in the end it ties the film together. The low keying lighting was perfect. The sound in the film went well with the current scene of action. The background music would set the mood using Al Green, Kool and the Gang, and Ricky Nelson. There is also music that gives personality and creates moods to the characters and film frames. I believe the sound choices used were effective for this movie. It assisted with enhancing the movie. The cinematography used supports the mood of the scene. In movie used many close-up scenes. One scene that sticks in mind is when Samuel L. Jackson is sucking through a straw. The scene builds tension because he is staring at Brad while sipping the drink, and his eyes are off the camera. It builds momentum for the audience knowing there will be a shot out or death coming soon. The camera is eye level with Jackson and the lighting reflects an image in his pupil. The films art is set up in a way to heighten scenes. There is humor, tension, violence, and graphic scenes that can be obscene. The social environment of the movie shows a pattern of events that do not typically happen. Vincent and Mia get up for a dance contest during dinnertime at a restaurant. Mia makes Vincent join her in the dancing. There is also a part when Marsellus and Butch's chase leads them to a pawnshop and Gimp and Marsellus gets sodomized, which is how the turn of events in Pulp fiction happen. There is a form of racism and violence in the social context. This lead into unexpected events from the story line that can distract some viewers because some of things that happen in the movie cannot be resolved and contradicts a resolution for the problem. The story has multiple stories making it hard to look for a straight story. The purpose of the film is to combine every type of film created into one movie. There is a bit of everything in the film, which created a film movement, and not as film story. There was a different narrative and visual technique used to convey the meaning of the film the qualities of these two traits created an artwork. I personally enjoyed the film after learning more about the world of film. I watched it one time and did not like it because I could not follow it. Now I understand the social themes through the mise-en-scene used in the film. I did not enjoy the movie until I could better understand it. This movie will now be on my list of movies to recommend. I will only recommend this movie to people who are open minded due to the racism and violence that takes place."
2 November 2014,hakym-reagan,0,0,8,Message accuracy,"This movie is a success in many different ways. I love the rawness of the action cuts and emotions portrayed by the actors. Everything on set or on camera is made to make the audience feel the authenticity and humanity in the story and the characters. It is true that there is only one camera covering most of the actions which is a downfall for covering every aspect of the message. Nonetheless, the director did his best with the one camera and perspective he had. As directors, we first have to think of movies as a message and the cameras as tools to tell the story. Different angles from different cameras can add details to a shot which appears more tense for the audience and more appealing as well. But in overall, even with one camera that he used mostly it shows talent and amazing creativity. There is no doubt to how far the creativity of the director of this movie can go. I just personally believe that if he played with the rules and used his creativity within the rules to break them, that would have been genius. I understand that rules are made to break them but we also have to think about which rules to break within the rules themselves. There are rules that if broken, a masterpiece can never reach its true value."
24 September 2014,jrleedom90,0,0,9,I give it a 9.0,"You Are the Critic: Part II If you like the intensity of, drugs, crime, twists and some of Hollywood's best actors, Pulp Fiction is a recommendable movie. Pulp Fiction was given a nine out of ten on the rating scale which is agreeable. The movie was a prime example of crime that could of occurred in the early 1990's. The rating is accurate due to the outstanding creative writing that several viewers agreed on. Although the movie gave a lot of glory to different types of criminals, the movie did have an interesting plot and the characters were synchronized with the whole movie. John Travolta and Uma Therman did an outstanding job in their roles. They worked well together and the chemistry was believable. Samuel L. Jackson also played an important role and was significant to the movie. There was also friendly chemistry between him and John Travolta throughout the whole movie and it seemed realistic. The two in the movie came off as intimidating and fearless. The setting was realistic and took place in several different areas. The only argument I would have over the movie is how the movie jumped from scene to scene. It went back and forth between Bruce Willis's character and John Travoltas which was kind of misleading and confusing the first time I watched it until the end. There were also several other characters who played important roles at different times. There was the crazy couple who held up the restaurant in a robbery when John Travolta happened to be there eating in his character. It was kind of confusing as to what was going on but made you curious as to what was going to happen next. There were some scenes that where a little too extreme such as the rape scene but made the movie edgy and kept you guessing and wondering. There was a mixture of all different types of people who commit crime that also intensified the movie. There was anything from a boxer, to gangsters and robbers. There is lots of yelling, screaming, deep conversations and gunshots through the whole movie. The movie genre is classified as crime which is ideal. It is also thriller which is also accurate due to all the violence that takes place throughout. It is definitely considerably a drama as well. There is some slight comedy but is not mentioned on the IMDb profile for this movie. The movie was pact full of different intensifiers. There was crime, lust, forbidden romance, drugs, money and all the above intertwined to make for a good movie that won several awards. The ending was unexpected but put all the pieces together as to why some of the characters were even in the movie and helped it make sense. All in all the movie was a masterpiece and lots of positive feedback and reviews from viewers and critics. I personally enjoyed the film and I would recommend the film to mature audiences only of course. The movie is captivating and can easily snag your attention for a couple hours."
25 September 2014,kellisale,0,4,2,Viewing for the first time!,"Pulp Fiction was filmed in 1994 in the city of Los Angeles. This movie falls into the film genre under action thriller. This movie fits well into the typical crime drama that we all know so well. This movie has two hit men, a boxer, his girlfriend, and a gangster's wife. The main point of the story is the two hit mean Vincent Vega and Jules are on a mission to retrieve a briefcase that has something mysterious insides that leaves the audience guessing. While the two men are on their quest, they encounter some problems like a restaurant robbery, a dead body in the back of their car, and a boxer on the run. The editing and the transition in this film were amazing and had perfect timing to make the movie flow smooth. There were perfect establishing shots that set up the scenes and give you an idea of what the story line was going to look like. The sound of music throughout the movie had good synchronous sound. The music fits into the background and the scenes really pop and fit together with the sound effects that were chosen. Some of those scenes would not have been as intense if the right music was not put into the correct places. This movie is hard not to get emotionally involved in. As stated above, the music or score elicit plays a major part in making scenes related to the audience. For example, the car scene where the gun goes off accidentally and the sound effect off the gun going off has a huge impact on someone's feeling and the way they react to it. This is not the only scene where music comes into play and makes an impact on the viewers. Cinematography is another art of film making that supports the tone of the movie. The camera perspective, the positions, and the camera distances. Pulp Fiction uses a variety of zoom shots and deep focus shots that you have eye level shots that really focus in on the characters and capture their facial expressions. The angels and the position of the camera really allows the audience to be involved in the film. Everything that it takes to make this film happen works through the magic of cinematography. After watching this film for the first time, I can't say I can pin point the meaning of the movie. There are three different story's that happened within this film and they are tied together to make the film a true thriller. I believe every movie has a story behind each one and something to tell the audience about morals and everyday decisions with the impact of real life situations. Being a first time viewer and not knowing what to expect I had no personal influences or any biases that made my decision regarding this film. I loved everything about the movie, the plot, and the characters. Pulp Fiction was well written and directed and I loved it. This movie was enjoyable to me because it had twists and turns and it kept me guessing about the briefcase. I was able to follow the dialog and stay interested throughout the entire movie without missing any key points.After everything is said and done I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone looking for a new action thriller. The actors are mind blowing and the movie is so different in a way that's hard to explain without viewing it for yourself. Nothing about this film will disappoint you and it will leave you wanting more."
6 October 2014,iofe-40036,0,0,10,greatest movie!,"I grew up with the marvelously written dialogs from Pulp Fiction!!! Know them by heart! Very daring approach to morality, questioning and making fun of everything that's supposed to be very serious. And what stroke the most is the form - the stories are interlinked and edited in such way that you are challenged to make the puzzle into a chronologically aligned story by yourself after viewing. And of course very inspiring music! Also I love the stories that Vincent Vega is telling about Amsterdam cause I live in Amsterdam and it's so nice to see that he is even smoking tobacco ""Drum"" which is still very popular here among Dutch people.love it! recommend to everybody!"

I enjoy Quentin Tarantino movies and this is one of my favorites of his as well. Everyone should watch Pulp Fiction at least once in their lifetime. I loved this movie because it was funny, smart, and it had some very memorable scenes! My fiancé and I enjoy quoting the movie to each other to make each other laugh. Sometimes, something in real life will make one of us remember a line or scene in the movie and it just cracks us up! :) Add to your Watchlist of movies you have to watch before you die. When we have a Tarantino weekend, we always have to watch Pulp Fiction! If you enjoy this Tarantino movie, also check out Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol.1 and Kill Bill Vol.2. Also rent Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained and Deathrace. Give them all a try, they will make you laugh, wince, drop your jaw, and most of all smile!"
14 January 2015,scotthallproductions,0,3,9,Gangster Story Telling,"Only a brilliant film nerd with amazing imagination, that knew grew up in LA, could make a movie like Pulp Fiction. Watching it again, and again, you will love it again and again. The cinematography is also great. The casting of the characters are perfect also. Editing, sound track, dialogue, locations...all awesome. I would hope one day QT, would create a Vega Brothers movie, staring John Travolta and Michael Madsen. There is so many quotable lines. My friend and I will just talk to each other with lines from the movie. The dance scene with the Saturday Night Fever star and sexy brilliant Uma, is one of my favorites scenes. Watch this movie!"

Quentin Taranto's masterpiece,""Pulp Fiction"", is simply brilliant. It has violence, quirky humor, great dialog, brilliant acting, memorable scenes etc. Tarantino's way of writing his dialog is fantastic, it's the most realistic way of speaking in a movie you will ever The story is tolled in an untraditional way as to what you may see in most films. It's tolled in a non-linear way. This is such a unique and original way of telling the story. The movie is broken up into different, small story's that all piece together and intertwine with each other. This is a very hard thing to pull off in a movie, but Tarantino does this brilliantly!The characters are fantastic. Each one has there own individual traits and personalities, so unique in there own way. My personal favorite is butch. His back story is really interesting. You could probably make a movie all about him if you wanted to. But each character is great.The acting.......the acting is.....it's so hard to describe how good the acting in this movie is. Some great actors\ actresses such as, Samuel.L.Jackson, John Travolta, Uma thurman,Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Harvey keitel, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken etc. And all of them put in a great performance.(Tarantino even got in on the act.) But the movie as a whole changed the way people view film. It changed the way people view telling a story. This movie isn't just a great movie, its groundbreaking, it's revolutionary, trailblazing, and it still holds up today.Definitely one of the greatest movies ever made!Looks like I wasn't lost for too many words."

All His movies are great, I hope I will meet him someday, and maybe be in one of his sick and twisted movies. I loved Kill Bill Volumes one and two. I loved his short part in Pulp Fiction. I Admit, it was small, but it sure was the best part in the movie. I will always laugh at that part in the movie. I Hope that he has his own show someday. It will be ten times better then CSI ever dreamed of, and by the way, I loved the CSI finale that he directed.

3 December 2014,Jilandop9,0,6,3,A poor and meciocre movie,"A mediocre, poor and shallow film, a silly movies like Pulp Fiction are the reason why Hollywood has always been treated as mere entertainment by French critics. Pulp Fiction is the Star Wars of the 90's decade. To start the film has a story so stupid and clueless, the director, Quentin Tarantino, addicted to video store movies, found that writing a nonlinear script would create a great movie, but it's all nonsense, editing is confuse, the characters are mere wooden planks, the biblical quotation tries to give a seriousness to the film, but is shallower than a teaspoon. Pulp Fiction has yet unnecessary dialogues as Jules and Vincent talking about bacon meat in the restaurant or on the foot massage Mia, the film also relies on Mucguffin created by Hitchcock and Welles in the 40's decade with the suitcase and its golden glow. Pulp Fiction is at best a mediocre film, without depth, mindless entertainment, not important. It's a shame that movies like this have a million votes and artistic works such as Jean Renoir or Shakespeare adaptations have little more than ten thousand. Says a lot about our decline in the arts taste."

The writing is spectacular and memorable down to every last word, the characters are unique and interesting while all still remaining grounded, and the cinematography and music help create some of the most memorable scenes in film history.With one of the greatest directors ever working with some of the best actors of the 90's playing career defining roles, it's easy to recognize how this film keeps its place as a monumental shift in the significance of films and their purpose as entertainment."
13 January 2015,Lucielong,0,3,10,10/10 For Pulp Fiction,"Brilliant film to watch and I would say this a great classic to watch and I advise everyone to watch it! I first watched the film in 2013 with my boyfriend and when I watched it all the 1st time I couldn't believe I've not watched it before! I'm in love with the style of the film, the fashion, the genre of year, the music and the acting. Quentin Tarantino is one of my favourite Directors and Film producer's and he just makes top quality films and he basically is a great guy for doing so! I could watch Pulp fiction and never get bored which is a rare thing! I would advise people to watch the film and give it ago because there is a rare fun beauty about this film! So don't be a square! ;)"
6 March 2018,Ira-Wendorf,0,0,10,Quentin Tarantino was way ahead of his time!,"The writing was phenomenal; when Tarantino shuffled the linear time line of the story and you could not detect in until the end it truly was a deception that only a master magician could preform. It is now 20 years later and I have seen other writers attempt it but everything else pales in comparison to Tarantino's genus.Of course the following actors:
Uma Thurman
John Travolta
Samuel L. Jackson
Uma Thurman
Harvey Keitel
Tim Roth
Amanda Plummer
Ving Rhames
Bruce Willis
Rosanna Arquette
Eric Stoltz
Christopher WalkenMade this film an authoritative classic that only ages because of ""The Five Dollar Shake"". I am a big fan of all of the actors and the writer Quentin Tarantino.Even today I still carry my Bad Mother F#@%& Wallet everywhere I go."
15 January 2015,shawnlove86,0,2,10,A classic that will stand the test of time .......,"I love this movie. I would personally love to thank ""Q"" for making this film. From the cinematic perspective, to the brash dialogue, this movie keeps your attention from beginning to the end. The twist and story lines intertwine in such a way that makes you feel like your involved in the film. But best of all, the reemergence of John Travolta. From his smooth delivery, to his unforgettable dance moves, this film definitely reminded us why we love him. Also to mention Sam Jackson. I can't say a day goes by where I feel like telling the passage and letting off a few rounds. So may I suggest you get yourself a ""5 dollar milkshake"" and a ""Royale with Cheese"", sit back and enjoy because this is a movie everyone should see."
16 January 2015,aninfinity2009,0,1,10,something extraordinary,"this is one of those masterpieces that only a mind like Tarantino can perform. my young age and experience in the cinematographic medium as critical I've noticed after hours of watching movies I've noticed that no one today or over time equaled or find another movie like a pulp fiction a masterpiece giving us a look at today nineties until today a movie that now since I do this review 2015 still has that spark of freshness and bright he had in his time and being a work of art performances unique, brilliant direction and a script that required more than any other to this day been able to match. are as pulp fiction films that make the film a unique moment to delve into those moments that are hard to find it in real life and make the film a wonder that even for my cinema today is not as good as but though there are no good movies movies that make one feel trapped and captured in a movie as before but I know the line of films like fargo know if followed, pulp fiction and American beauty can come up with something big today . pulp fiction only be described as great"

The characters the film making the drugs the banter between the characters everything in between has all become one and the same under Quentin Tarantino's directing. I've always been intrigued by Samuel L Jackson's portrayal of Jules Winnfield a self proclaimed gangster,righteous man, shepherd and more, specifically what makes me interested in this character is that he sees himself as a cleanser of the bad guys his quoting of Ezekiel, a biblical passage of epic proportions fits in well with this righteous character and only pulls me in further in this film. This is my review of one character specifically but a review none the less."
5 January 2017,lapeachmc,0,0,9,Movie unlike any other,I have first seen this movie at a very young age (some would argue even too young for the amount of mature language and drugs it contains) but ever since then I was hooked. I have seen it many times since then and I still find it entertaining and somehow different to other movies that I usually enjoy. By now I know most of the parts by heart and a part of my family and I use certain quotes as inside jokes between us. The characters are distinct and well played. As this was the first Tarantino movie I have ever seen I was pleasantly surprised by the scenes being out of order. It gave the movie more of an interesting turn and there's an enjoyable outcome to it when in the end it all falls into place and you finally understand the original order of the scenes.Overall one of my favorite movies ever :)

It's as close to perfection as it will ever get... Every time I watch this film, and the more often I do, details and subtext magnificently surface and surprise me over and over again. It's truly a masterpiece and one of a kind. It is by far my all time favorite movie! Although I do not usually like it when directors also fill in a role in their own movie, Quentin Tarantino easily gets away with it in this film. He is one of the best directors this world has ever seen. But hey, that's just my humble opinion :-)"

This movie probably contains some of the best known scenes in film-industry. It is totally worth watching, and I would really recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen this classic movie yet. At first I thought the movie was too old for me, but afterwards it absolutely felt like I watched a movie that was released not long ago. Stunning performances by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman, the characters are also very well thought of.My conclusion is that this is a must-see classic full of fun and surprisingly good plot too!"
10 March 2015,hterr98,0,0,10,work of art,Tarantino makes great use of non-linear narratives which creates an experience that you will not forget. with a cast of divine actors (and a short appearance of Quentin himself) makes this movie an experience that will a stay in your mind for a lifetime. although if watching with others some scenes are highly disturbing and may put you off mood the movie is a masterpiece of well written non- linear story and there are plenty of laughs to make up for it. in conclusion if you are deciding whether or not to watch this movie (in my opinion) you definitely should should as it is an amazing movie and it leave plenty of thought for your imagination.
26 March 2015,ksenea,0,0,10,Pulp Fiction paradox,"Pulp Fiction paradox no doubt comes from the individual director. Contrasting specifically demonstrated the love of violence and found at the dump film garbage gems their real ego humanist and idealist , Tarantino was one of his best films. Dramatic ideally divided into three separate stories, harmoniously living space of one film, Pulp Fiction exists under the laws road movie. From the beginning of the road dives to the same dives in the final - seems to be circling round and round on the spot, this movie still does a huge way. Therefore Fiction (as, in fact, all the other Tarantino films) remained in history whimsical set of quotes , and alive, just pour in cinematographic reality. And the ""Olive Branch"" with ""Oscar"" for the most modest scenario of the possible rewards."
18 May 2015,anfeliperom,0,0,7,"A good and violent film with external plot, which leaves us wanting more.","It's a good film in the violent background, showing the history of different characters and situations in the course of the film are bonded or known. Although context is not much plot, we can internalize within it, being interested in a character in common, hoping to resume its history and we know what the hell happened. When they find the solution or the violent end of each story, we may be left wanting more. It is a work of art violent, obviously led by one of the best directors, with the type of ""violence"" established.During the film, too, we can see that some stories are internalized other. Knowing that the film is directed by Quentin Tarantino leaves us with the feeling that we have to see the movie without exception, we know have some kind of violence with it, and it will be a different theme for the other Tarantino movies."
25 June 2005,bibudh,0,1,9,a great movie!!!!!!,"I just recently bought the DVD of ""PulP Fiction"" and what a movie it was? an outstanding movie with a great plot, excellent casts and great conversations full of humor. The story of the film is told in a non linear manner and what a fine way of story telling that Mr. Tarantino uses to keep the viewers experience a journey of 2 hrs 34 mins. full of gore, violence and humor. And viewers got to understand before they watch the movie is that the journey is not going to be safe. It's full of surprises that might shock you and it's so much fun too! From the opening scene of Hunny Bunny and Pumpkin to the final scene, the film is full of profanity but the conversations are so interesting ranging from discussions about what Quarter Pound with cheese is called in French to the level of sexual intimacy that a foot massage can give! that its also fun listening to the audio of the film, i've tried it and it's so much fun. John Travolta as laconic hit-man Vincent has given a fine performance and his comic team work with Samuel L. Jackson, a fiery hit-man Jules is great. The cast is so great that even minor characters like Lance(Eric Stolz) are the ones who do a fine job making this film interesting. Finally, a great movie, a movie that you just can't miss to watch and this is movie you can watch over and over. But still, first timers are so lucky to get the experience that we won't ever get again."

They more or less shift over and beside each other and then when you finally think everything happened and the movie appears to be over. BAM another plot hole come along. I do wonder what the script looked like that Tarantino has for this film cause i viewed the Scrip on internet but still the real script he had for this must really be something weird. but at the end of the film you can put everything in place and when you figure out every plot-hole and side story it makes the best movie ever. Also i find it cool that so many big stars play in this movie Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thruman, John Travolta and many move famous Hollywood actors it's Just great.They really should make a few more movie with this kind of style to it."
1 May 2015,mbarger-38754,0,0,10,A very interesting movie,"Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions and their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames); his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman); struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis); master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. This movie is a series of less-and-more related but separated short stories of crime and comedy that each result into an unexpected ending including unexpected deaths, sudden twists, black comedy events and horrific conclusions of crime and its following consequences. The theme of Pulp Fiction is power when Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the film. The theme of power is very prevalent during Jules Winnfield's scene at the apartment and with one of the most controversial aspect of the film, which is the literal use of the N-word. When you watch the movie, you can tell that Marsellus has some severe power over all the actors in one way or another. Since I don't have a massive list of movies I watched, I can't really make a reference to another film due to the fact that of the films I watched, none of them match what pulp fiction has for its theme. The film uses the motif of the control Marsellus has over the characters, by using shadows to stay hidden and the fact that he is merciless, like when Vincent hears that Marsellus threw someone out the window for giving his wife a foot massage. When Marsellus is on the screen you can clearly see that the other characters are scared of him. The lighting of the film is very appropriate and it looks like there is a bunch of natural light when the scenes are near windows or outside and the use of the lights from the bulbs in the indoor scenes, where the light comes from those bulbs and not from an external source of light (studio lights to make the scene brighter). Fear and power are some of the easiest ways to gain respect from people, but it can lead to having some of your people to oppose you."
26 December 2017,albor_bozo,0,1,10,best movie make it by tarantino,"Pulp Fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of Siskel & Ebert devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas. In Siskels view, the violent intensity of Pulp Fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock's Psycho 1960, Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde 1967, and Stanley Kubricks A Clockwork Orange 1971. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for Pulp Fiction. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies"
12 May 2015,AleWingfield,0,0,10,The Best Film Ever,"I believe this is probably the best movie ever made, I feel I have got a lot from this film and from Tarantino. This movie is everything you want from a masterpiece, someone would say too much violence, but violence is part of our everyday life, so why don't show it. I love every single beat of this amazing movie, the lights or the actors, so perfectly characterise. But probably the best thing is the script, sublime! This is the movie that have launched Tarantino as Director, so more likely this his first masterpiece, which have been followed from such great movies as Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds and Django. I am not forgetting Reservoir Dogs, which is great, thinking at the script and the single location they have used. But this one is THE BEST!"
23 May 2015,anddim,0,0,7,Interesting. Promotes a style of its own.,"An interesting approach by a widely regarded individual in the industry. It is a movie with a style of its own. Excellent cinematography, great dialogue and an easy-going plot that has boring and dull moments. Yes, indeed. There are some gaps of monotonous conversation that should have been filled with more action. I can see its influence but I most definitely wouldn't consider it one of the greatest films ever made. Soundtrack that works as a homage to the 1950s - 1960s eras and an ensemble of cool actors and actresses that really get this thing going on.Check it out (If you still haven't ...)"
19 July 2015,octaviosegoviagarro,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's Masterpiece,"The film is a storytelling trip that never ceases to amaze the viewer and surprise him. It depicts various, interconnected story lines, which should be enough to make the movie interesting, but that wasn't enough for Quentin Tarantino. He had to give us a non-linear narrative, but that doesn't make the film hard to follow; at all. The violent characters are presented in a familiar way which makes the viewer quickly relate to them, whoever they are. The soundtrack is amazing. The dialogue is filled with quotable lines and seems very organic, given the events of the story. These are all aspects of and amazing movie, which seems a little bit over-the-top, but highly believable at the same time: my favorite aspect of Tarantino's films. This is, undoubtedly, his masterpiece, which, considering the rest of his work, is saying a lot."

Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."
14 March 2006,chris-w-1,0,2,9,The One For Movie Lovers EVERYWERE!!,"Now, Pulp Fiction is a movie that you need to pay attention to, not a movie in which you simply lay back and pay no attention to, it requires logic, determination and a simple sense of mind.We have here an all-star cast ranging from my favourite Bruce Willis to Uma Thurman with John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken and the main man Tarantino himself. It would be a shame for me to tell you each of the superb stories in stead ill sum them up, Travoltas and Jacksons story is electrifying, Willis' is probably the weakest down to the fact of bordering on plain weird, but still immense fun to watch (while being rather weird, people who have seen the movie will remember the nasty rape scene) Thurmans tale has a simple message in my mind, that of being Don't USE DRUGS!!! listen kids it all makes sense!Maybe you are quite simply looking for a good old movie to pass some time, or perhaps you want to see a movie which will change the way you think about the movie world forever, either way this movie is an absolute necessity to your collection!! Especially since I managed to get hold of a double-disc copy for £7!!!!!I urge everyone to watch this movie, but not if your under the age of 14 as there are some scenes that really are not suitable for young teens, except for that, its an absolute MUST-SEE!!

23 April 2016,marshallzoe,0,0,7,An interesting movie to say the least.,"Indeed, Pulp Fiction operates in the hinterland between reality and movie reality. Into a cadre of movie archetypes — the assassin, the mob boss, the gangster's moll, the boxer who throws a fight — Tarantino injects a reality check that is as funny as it is refreshing. Whereas most crime flicks would breeze over the rendezvous between Vincent and Mia, here we actually get to go on the date— polite chit-chat, awkward silences, bad dancing — before it spirals off into a drugged- up disaster. Just as Dogs is a heist film where you don't see the heist, Pulp is a boxer-takes-a- dive flick where you never see the bout, opting instead for conversations about muffins and Deliverance-style rape. Moreover, after Vincent and Jules take back Marsellus' briefcase, rather than cutting to a cop on their trail, we stay with them and revel in their banal banter as they dispose of a corpse (the genius of Keitel's Wolf in this effort is a moot point — how much intelligence does it take | to clean a car, then throw a rug over the back seat?)"
12 July 2015,welcometothewarehouse,0,1,9,Awesome Movie,"I was the only one of my friends that when this movie came out i could follow it from beginning to end. I thought the idea to put the ending in the beginning the beginning at the end and everything mixed up in between was genius total genius. The movie showed us what it would be like to see reality in a way someone who is in their head might see it. Ultimate movie classic it is up there with some of the best. Titles like A Clockwork Orange, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Shock Treatment, Natural Born Killers, and Cry Baby to name a few. But that list goes on and on. We need more movies like this and the others, it's great they want to make remakes of movies, but the originals that take creative thinking to a whole new level are the best. I love the ones that push the limits and boundaries to make us go huh and they did not go there. In the the too politically world we live in now these are a great reminder of why we are American and what makes our country so great. We can go there and make the movie viewing experience such a wonderful and pleasant thing."
22 July 2015,MichaelWoodX,0,1,9,One of the best movie ever seen in my life,"One of the best movie ever seen for years, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson."

The performance of the actors are truly genius. The characters are emblematic. The movie takes you through a journey full of violence, drugs and blood. One of the big pros of this movie, its the fact that its divided on segments. Each of this segments, takes you to a different part of the sequence. And it's amazing how every single piece fits at the end of the movie. The script is genius. Also it's great to see Tarantino on screen. There's a lot of directors that tends to appear on their movie. The cast it's wonderful, couldn't be more perfect than this. You will be scared, you will laugh, you will dance, you will cry but mostly, you will be on suspense during the whole time. There's a lot of scenes that are very risky, talking about the photography and direction of the movie, but the story really fits. Genius movie."
4 September 2015,agarutti,0,0,10,A true masterpiece and Tarantino's best work.,"This movie is a classic and rightfully so. I love Tarantino's work (Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Django...) but this is without a doubt his masterpiece. Probably the greatest aspect of this movie, at least to me, is its dialogue which, as many noted, is hilarious, smart and above all unique. You just can't find dialogue like this in another movie (apart from, in part, other Tarantino films) simply because it could not work anywhere else. The exchanges seem casual and realistic in this context yet are bizarre and absurd...I don't really know how to describe them but I know I loved them. Also, there are obviously famous scenes which everyone remembers - the dance, the overdose,the ""Ezekiel 25.17""...but this movie is truly spectacular from beginning to end. Plus ALL actors give memorable performances (probably for me Travolta and Samuel Jackson above all others) and represent great characters. Mr Wolf clearly stands out for originality and he is not even one of the main characters.What some might think that lacks in this film is a ""morale"", a hidden deep meaning, but in this case I think there just isn't one. I appreciate movies with a strong message but Pulp Fiction doesn't need one...It is amazing the way it is and the final scene and some of the dialogue still made me think, although they are presented always with irony. It's in my top 3 of all time because to me it has everything: great plot, great characters, great direction, witty, entertaining... I could spend hours talking about this movie and there are surely important things I forgot to mention but finally if you still haven't seen it (!) just go and watch it."

Thumbs up for Vincent :D So Tarantino did a good job in this movie, involving some great actors and actresses, like Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. For me, Tarantino's a big director, one of the tops of Hollywood. The cast also does not lack, are performances so well staged. The film is so good that you end up getting stuck with it. Another very good film of Quentin Tarantino is inglorious bastards. Another cast that does not lack, Brad Pitt, Til Schweiger, Christopher Waltz ... and so on ha ha. Thumbs up for Quentin!"
10 February 2016,kirschbaluke,0,0,9,A Quentin Tarantino Classic,"Guns, gangsters, blood, and blow. It can all be found in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 movie, Pulp Fiction. This exciting, and notably disturbing, thriller unfolds the story of two hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) as they rampage about Los Angeles doing dirty work for their drug kingpin boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In this midst of kicking in doors, the boys are given an order by the boss man himself to kill a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) for not throwing a match. The bloody murdering and drug-overdosing events that happen during the course of the film is what leaves viewers oddly begging for more (Note: not a movie for children).Cinematographer, Andrzej Sekuła, paints a beautiful setting of Los Angeles in this movie. From the run down neighborhoods where the drug dealers abide to Marsellus' upscale house in the hill, this movie will make your eyes fall in love. The small elements of the film such as the paint chipping off the apartment hallway walls or the dim, smoke- filled bars are what really make the picture quality stand apart from other productions. Of course there are scenes that aren't so pleasant, but necessary to add to the aura of the movie. In one scene, Vincent Vega ""accidentally"" shoots a drug dealer right through the eyes in a car and it literally shows pieces of brain splattered entirely throughout. A darker scene yet depicts Marsellus Wallace being tied up and brutally raped by a backwoods pawn store owner that looks as if he should have starred in the movie Deliverance. It's scenes like this that made me feel I truly had to take a shower afterwards because it was so gruesome and dirty, but at the same time powerful. And then there is how the actors are portrayed physically. Vincent is shown as this sly, hair slicked back guy with an earning in his ear. It's no doubt from the start viewers know he's the ladies' man. Jules on the other hand is portrayed as being scarily philosophical, complete with an afro, lamb chops, and a gold chain. Both these men are sharply dressed in suits which shows they are to be reckoned with. The downside but somewhat interesting part of this movie is the plot. It requires the viewer to stay completely in tuned to what is going on. In fact, I would never have liked this movie if I did not re watch it a second time to understand it better! This is due in part of Quentin Tarantino's famous nonlinear plot style. This means the movie does not follow in perfect sequence but instead falls back on itself from time to time. The opening scene shown in the movie actually does not even take place until the very end. This can leave viewers confused because actors are shown immediately in the movie that do not show up until the end. If you are a movie goer that just likes to see big explosions whilst lacking an in depth story line, this movie is NOT for you. On the contrary, if you are the type of viewer that feeds off how certain ambiguous scenes tie together in the long run, I would strongly advise watching this movie. If you want to know how in the hell Quentin Tarantino managed to link a scene that opens the movie to a scene that ends the movie, get this movie at all costs!"

As soon as 'Misrlou' started playing during the introduction, I knew this was gonna be one bad ass movie! The direction and amazing acting from the cast made this hit not only a Thriller, but also a Comedy even though it was not intended!Another reason why this movie is a beast is because it has an amazing soundtrack! And that played a really important factorThe only thing I didn't appreciate much about the movie is the need for a multiple of plots and stories. But hey, I can't question the direction!The movie does contain many memorable quotes and I'm pretty sure this movie will still be remembered even after a 100 years!At the end, I'd recommend this as a must watch for anyone who likes bad ass mafia movies!Acting: 9/10 Plot : 7/10 Soundtrack: 10/10!

                        ",Thumps up,"This movie will open you up, and make you feel excited. Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages but there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'wow! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again."

Not just a great movie, but a historic movie. Not just a historic movie, but the best dang movie ever in the history of movie-making. Is that too far fetched? Maybe. But the fact remains, Pulp Fiction rules. Therefore, if you enjoy action, comedy, suspense, thrills, chills, laughs, uncomfortable moments, violence, depravity, murder, music, mayhem, and clever jokes, then this is the movie for you.

The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of which the N-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenaline scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure.

18 September 2016,sriaukaiteriaukaite,0,0,10,best movie,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologue. It has loyalty among low life's, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."

8 November 2017,oscarlmao,0,1,10,One of the Most Iconic Films in History.,"Pulp Fiction. One of Cinema's greatest masterpieces of all time. An easy to follow plot with a unique way of storytelling. This movie is very skilled at the dialogue and character progression. And this is only Tarantino's second film! The music in this movie is excellent, probably my favorite film soundtrack ever (when I say that I mean soundtrack not made for the film, unlike films such as Star Wars or Jaws). Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and a huge inspiration to me and many others. 10/10. ~Oscar."
9 August 2017,whiplash-44651,0,0,10,The best movie ever,One of my all time favorite movies. Pulp Fiction is perfect in every way. Might just be the best written film of all time. The dialogue is perfect and the characters are consistently well written. Quentin Tarantino has a lot of great films but this might be his best. Endlessly re-watchable and has something for everyone. Its funny and well made. I'd recommend this film if you haven't seen it.
17 April 2017,ramdoggp,0,0,9,Very good movie,One of the greatest movies ever made!!!I like this kind of movie and story line its very entertaining and after all these years it still captivates the imaginations of millions worldwide. All of Tarantino movies are good and also the cast of the movie is of high desent cus All of the cast went on to become mega stars.
11 November 2005,Triagain5,0,2,10,Crime Drama at it's Best,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is a stunning film that is as entertaining as it is provocative. The story is told in three different parts. The first two send us on a wild ride while that last is peppered with hilarious dark comedy. The overlapped story-telling helps the movie flow and isn't convoluted enough to confuse the viewer. The story is pushed along with excellent dialogue that simultaneously builds character and plot. Never is a character forced to spout a trite line just to move the plot along. It all feels natural, with a wit that never makes this film seem dark, even though what we see on screen would perhaps be perceived that way from any other filmmaker. The soundtrack also perfectly fits each scene; or at least forces us to believe so. Like these songs were meant to be here and no where else. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are both excellent as the goofy Vincent and cool Jules. They both make us like these people. People that are low-lifes and criminals. Perhaps the greatest part of ""Pulp Fiction"" is the character of it's characters. So well-rounded, there may not be a one-dimensional character in the movie. The strongest characters show weakness, and the meanest show compassion. Seeing this movie can change the way you feel about movies. It's what a movie should be, combining great acting, dialogue, music, direction, and entertainment. A fine work that should, and will, be remembered forever as the turning point in 90's cinema."

I still have the same point. Did I think that Pulp Fiction is really as good as people told about it? No. I had watched some movies by Tarantino before watching Pulp Fiction, I liked it very much, especially Django Unchained, but I hadn't thought that this movie is really amazing. Pulp Fiction is the mix of gorgeous script, exciting acting, great cinematography and special soundtracks. Every song in this movie fits perfectly. I can be sure that I want to watch Pulp Fiction again and again.Thank you, Quentin, so much for doing your work!"

                        ",Ezekiel 25:17,"In Jules biblical ranting, the character has taken great liberty in his quote of Ezekiel 25:17. There is nothing in this passage that refers to the ""tyranny of evil men"", ""charity"", or ""finders of lost children"". Great speech, but as in many films, the facts get lost in the editing. I'm not sure why the writers selected this passage. I believe others could have been more relevant and could have been written in with less ""poetic license"". Nevertheless, here is a King James version of the real Ezekiel 25:17 ""And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them."""

But this isn't enough to make film memorable.Set of actors is especially noteworthy.Film looks like it was especially written for the actors.All of main characters play their roles excellently and racy. Again, dialogues in this film is something perfect. They are realistic, interesting, full of philosphic themes and humor with unique, Tarrantino's style. Also, these film has many interesting situations. You think that everything take its course, but little ""surprise"" and everything had changed. And every plot device is unexpexted, it turns everything on its ear. Behind simple scenes from chip crime movie, Tarrantino reveals philosophic themes, add interesting black humor, perfect actors and mix it into masterpiece movie, that combine everything best from entertaining movie industry. In my opinion, this film has only one minus: it was best Tarantino's film. For every year his films becomes more comedic and less thoughtful and planned."
14 October 2005,roman_soldir,0,2,10,The best movie of all times !!!,"Unique storyline, with funny and cool twists. The masterpiece. Tarantino is a genius, with a dark sense of humour. Movie is full of funny moments if you appreciate a unique sense of humour and irony. At the same time movie always keeps this ""cool"" feel with unpredictable turn of events. Acting is amazing. Travolta and Jackson perfectly portray the image of stone cold gangsters. Sometimes situations are so bad that they are forced to show their true emotions, because even the most cold hearted killer, still got a heart, it just needs to be ""defrosted"" with some explosive circumstances. The soundtrack is also in tune with the movie, because it is so unique but at the same time it fits in with the screenplay. Nothing will ever beat this."

15 August 2017,GQ_Kings_Palaces_LLC,0,1,10,Pulp Fiction and Personality,"Recently my wife and I had a meeting with our Church regarding more and better ways of learning about each others personality. We find ourselves butting heads from time to time and were curious what direction we would go, in order to mend our past mistakes.So we found out that our personalities were similar to each others. She is a leader of many and so am I! Two dominant personality types living together each day and making decisions as we are accustomed to. Where is the happy ground? We are still working on this.Throughout Pulp Fiction we notice very Powerful Personalities. These men and women are, in a sense, legends of the league of gentlemen that they were brought up around. Vincent is truly sincere in all his behavior as is Jules. It is instilled within these characters that they know best. The Powerful personality of Bruce causes possible ""fruitless"" circumstances to ""progress"". Bruce's bad decisions throughout the movie had placed him in tough situations. However he was able to overcome them. He was a very powerful personality type.It was clear to me after watching Pulp Fiction that being in tough situations can be saddening at times. But as we develop our understanding of what these characters have had to go through, why they make decisions and what decisions they make, it becomes more obvious.The World is a tough place but if we seek to find each other through some method of focus and understanding, we can win.Pulp Fiction is a great movie and a way to search deep within your own personality, find yourself and recognize that others are different."

28 August 2017,renatojabuka-11967,0,1,9,Pulp fiction is wonderful,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."

25 January 2018,guccdiamonds,0,1,10,great!!!!!!,"To begin, I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I don't know if it was the adult themed story, the classic lines that you could find yourself repeating as if it was a cult classic, or the simplistic nature of the story, but I simply fell in love with this wacky piece of cinema. SpongeBob is not your typical hero, and his friend Patrick, doesn't seem to fit the mold of your typical ""best-friend role"". I found myself laughing at this film because of the messages that it taught and how I guy like me, stuck in the retail world, could easily identify with the trauma that SpongeBob was experiencing. Also, this film was flat out hysterical. I wasn't expecting anything except for kids humor when I first watched it, but after the final credits rolled I was impressed by how adult oriented the humor truly was. The comic timing was perfect, the music resonated perfectly in my ear, and I can honestly say that from the opening pirate credits to the final jump in the air, this film was the rawest form of cinematic perfection and the BEST film I have seen this 2005 year (so far).I know you are probably thinking, ""Andy, you watch a lot of movies, why did you like this one so much?"" and I really don't have a straightforward answer to that question. Perhaps it is the repetitive nature of the films that I am currently watching that had me running towards the arms of this SpongeBob movie, or maybe because comedies are not quite the caliber of humor as they once were (resorting to restroom humor and sex instead of actual ""funny"" comedy), or maybe it was because it told a story that I could relate to, but whatever the case may be this film ranks among the best. I have seen this movie about 20+ times already and cannot wait to see it again. It is one of those films where I catch something new each time, I still laugh at most of the scenes (the bar scene is my personal favorite), and I get that aura of excitement every time I place the DVD in the player. This film is like my unquenchable drug of choice.SpongeBob is one of those heroes that I can, and I think most in the retail/working sector of the world, relate to. He works hard, he wants promotion, and continues to live his life as his heart allows like a kid. Isn't that what we all desire? I know that is a crucial element to my life to ensure that I stay true to those and myself around me. Also, it has always been a dream of mine to have a seaweed mustache, and this film promotes the use of this green apparatus. I don't want to sound repetitive, but I cannot wait to add this film to my DVD collection. It provided, and still provides, at least an hour and a half of pure, uncut, humor that will leave some great songs in your mind and this new found respect in your heart. Who hasn't walked into your office one day just singing, ""I'm ready, promotion. I'm ready, promotion"". Or better yet, ended the day singing, ""I'm ready, depression. I'm ready, depression."" HA, this has me nearly falling out of my seat as I type this now.The heart, humor, and childlike feeling for this hero will have children falling over to see this film (though where I work most children are not huge fans of this film they say that television program is better), and if it is watched by an embarrassed adult, you will be surprised on how much you could probably relate to this film. We are all ""goofy goobers"" inside, and sometimes it takes a film such as this to pull it out of us. We all wish that we could break out into song whenever possible or even spend an evening at a bar enjoying round after round of ice cream treats.Overall, I loved this movie. Well, actually, I more than loved it, I thought it was one of the best films that I have seen this year. So many times we watch movies that get too caught up in themselves. They are too serious or too violent or too goofy for what they set out to be, and it was an honest delight to finally find something that was just what it was. SpongeBob is my new hero and I have already found myself watching the television programs whenever possible. You have a new fan SpongeBob I hope that you will always remain the ""goofy goober"" that I fell in love with!!"

Just want to voice my own opinion. Now I love Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Bastards are two of my all time favorite movies but this.... is a huge disappointment. The multiple narratives we're interesting at first but soon you realise they are pointless. More filler than anything else. It has no real pay off for this except I guess for the viewer to connect and understand each character. But it didn't do that for me. The ending is fine, the story is meh and the characters are very fake feeling. I don't know why but they came off very artificial except Samuel L. Jackson. The directing is amazing as to be expected and the cinematography is great. But don't let my review hold you back from seeing this movie. Even though I disliked the narrative and storyline the directing, acting and cinematography are hugely enjoyable as always with any Tarantino film. So if your a movie fan or interested in any aspect of film making you should definitely give this I watch. (However I would recommend you watch Tarantino's other work first)"

She simply did not enjoy the movie, and could not get into it. I rate it as one of those movies that if you have not seen it, you are missing out. This movie is often referenced in other movies"

Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée.

I liked the movie too much because of the non-linear plot, and then you see scenes from the past that explain why some things are happening. I liked that the frames were too close to the character. And the dialogues, which perhaps do not contribute much to the story, but which are undoubtedly part of it and add naturalness to the characters and the film."

19 February 2018,davidlrabello,0,1,10,Pop Culture Cult Classic,"People might tell you the revolutionary non-linear structure is why this movie is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.Others, might tell you its due to the superb and iconic acting by the hands of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman.Some might just tell you it's 90's magic and other pop culture references.Although every single one of these points are valid, the real reason is the dialogue; dialogue is what fuels pulp fiction, and is what separates it from any other movie out there. The characters actually sound real! They sound like they are having actual conversations, and at the same time, they are serving the plot by feeding the audience information in a fun and exciting way. For example, when Vincent and Jules talk about how Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror through a greenhouse for giving his wife a foot massage, this might sound like useless gossip, but this is actually setting up and building up tension for later when Vincent and Mia meet. This movie is masterfully constructed in a way, where the characters sound real, the storytelling is unpredictable and surprising, suspense is built and relieved, dialogue is witty and update, and most of all; It is hilarious! I have only touched the tip of the iceberg, and every time I watch it, I discover more!This movie is a thrill ride, a timeless classic to be watched by friends and family forever."

Scenes aren't in order of time, so while your mind is trying to fix up the ""fabula"", your eyes are glued to the screen to enjoy the story, the perfect performance of actors and their wonderful dialogs. I advise this masterpiece to anyone loves gangster film, but, above all, to anyone doesn't like this genre 'cause with this movie you will start enjoying guns, drug and homicides! I'm joking. Under all this violence there is a comic vein, for example when Vincent accidentally shoots a man in his boss'car and ""The Wolf"" arrives. The interpretation of John Travolta and Samuel L.Jacson as mob hit men is wonderful, but I must exalt the coldness and that Harvey Keitel transmits through his character. What do I have to write more? Have a good vision!"

Quentin, please re-release; I'll be one of the first to go (and maybe plural times)! In my own opinion, John Travolta has done nothing good since Grease (1978), except for his portrayal of Vincent Vega. I'm sure all of this has been said, and I don't add much that the P.F. community does not already know. I love Southern CA, the backdrop for this action. It's so much ordinary living, but the characters are so genuine. I made up some trivia questions, after seeing it for perhaps the 10th time:What brand of cereal is Lance eating when Vincent calls? What brand of hand-rolling tobacco does Vincent smoke? What are the two board games sitting in boxes at Lance's home? What is Vincent having for breakfast with Jules at the coffee shop? What is the first, numeric digit on the CA license plate on the Wolf's car? What brand of cigarettes does Butch request when he's at the bar? What is the name of the novel that Vincent is reading, both of the times he's in the bathroom?Those are a few obscure things I remember."

25 January 2006,vincentconstatine,0,1,10,The most revolutionary movie in the past twenty years sets the tone for movies made by corporations and independent film makers alike.,"When Pulp Fiction was introduced at Sundance the film industry would never be the same. Pulp Fiction revolutionized the way films are made and the way stories are told. This is a masterpiece in many varied and distinct aspects of film. What sets Pulp Fiction apart from the mainstream is writer and director Quentin Tarantino's uncanny way to write dialect. Pulp Fiction continues to capture audiences today, and the reason is Tarantino's radical method of telling his story. Tarantino has found a way to make you listen to him ramble on with his humorous dialog and tempt you until he finally a major even happens in the story, which is usually a murder. The acting in Pulp Fiction is an amazing achievement in it's own right. The movie contains numerous actors that give the unusual characters they portray qualities of everyday people that only do unusual things. The list of actors include: Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Wills, Harry Keitrl, Ving Rames, and Tim Roth. The movie is originality at its peek, and the dialog is the best i've ever seen."

21 March 2006,joshua-krawiec,0,2,10,"Slowly Thrilling, a True Masterpiece","PF is one of the greatest pictures of the 1990s, it is built on the guidelines one might attach to an art-house film and is yet quite mainstream, people should look beyond the violence and see that every single violent occurrence is integral to the plot.People say that it's disturbing, I say 'exactly', and it's not easing watching and how could you make a plot like that of PF easy.No-one has ever been able to replicate PF, anyone can have someone rambling about philosophy or the meaning of a foot massage but the whole purpose of things like the initial scene is to seem unique to QT.PF allows people to see typical conversations that we all might have, e.g. about a guy getting jealous because his friend had touched his wife's feet, but it's shocking because we never really know if he did throw Antoine out of the window.What gets you satisfied and horrified like PF"
13 October 2018,as-hleyk,0,0,10,A Royale with Cheese,"Pulp Fiction is an American crime movie in which Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and Vincent Vega, by John Travolta, are two hitmen out to retrieve a stolen briefcase from their employer, a mob boss named Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames. In a connecting story, Wallace also asks Vega to take his wife Uma Thurman's character, Mia, out while he is out of town, and Bruce Willis' Butch Coolidge, an aging boxer, is paid by Wallace to lose his fight. The series of seemingly unrelated stories are interwoven in a film full of twists, violence, and redemption. Appropriately so, the film's title is a direct reference to pulp magazines popular during the first half of the 20th century, known for their dialogue and lurid scenes. The film focuses on the conversations between characters, which lead to each character's own development, and is infamous for its extensive use of violence. Although Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction may confuse some viewers due to the film's nonlinear organization and lack of clear protagonists, it is one of the most influential movies of all time for its memorable dialogue and soundtrack. 
Since its debut in 1994, Pulp Fiction has been considered one of the most highly commended films of all time. In just over two years, the movie won 64 times out of the 69 times it was nominated for an award. These awards and nominations ranged from Oscars for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"" and a Cannes Palme d'or to Polish awards for ""Best Foreign Film"" and Brit awards for ""Best Soundtrack."" IMDB rates this film as within the top 10 rated movies of all time. With many more nominations and wins for various awards worldwide, it is difficult not to be curious about the publicity around the movie.
However, there are many people who can't seem to understand the film's success. According to Adam G., a critic on IMDB, Pulp Fiction was one of Tarantino's ""insane, self-indulgent, and bloated"" works. In reality, Tarantino's ""insanity"" is what led to the film's success. Tarantino created a final product that somehow remained coherent while retaining all the creative, impulsive decisions he made while directing the film. If Pulp Fiction was directed in the same way every other movie has been and is, it definitely wouldn't be the popular and beloved film it is to this day. 
One of the most polarizing aspects of Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Adam, alongside many other unhappy viewers, argued that Tarantino let the movie run too long because he ""was in love with the sound of his own voice."" Although some parts of digression sound like they should have been cut out of the final film, many parts of dialogue are full of pop culture references and observations on human behavior, making each tangent philosophical and unique. This a far contrast to the generic black-and-white conversations in every other action film. Especially between Vega and Winnfield, there is a sense of realism that gets lost in the production of big-screen movies. The conversations between them hold something theatrical while sounding natural at the same time. It's a combination which demands the audience's attention. Tarantino's famed dialogue actually has led to some of the most memorable lines from movies of all time. A conversation about burgers across the globe may seem like something that should have been left out of a crime movie, but some users of the Internet used this scene to portray Brett Kavanaugh's hearing. In the midst of controversy over Kavanaugh being accused of sexual assault, the Internet turned him into a fearful character in a well-known Pulp Fiction scene, allowing for others to express their opinions regarding the case. Not only has this ""useless"" scene become iconic in modern day culture, it has also become a way for relevant information to be relayed. 
Like many others who left negative reviews under Pulp Fiction, Adam also argued that the movie ultimately lacked a plot. While the larger meaning of the movie remains unclear, the film definitely has a story to tell. Tarantino's unique play on the gangster crime film is seen by how he uses details to drive the movie, even if it digresses from the typical film's plot development. As much as I'd recommend watching the movie, I'd also strongly recommend watching it for the second time since the movie will be more easily understood and enjoyed after understanding the story in chronological order. This is not to say that this film would be better off organized less abstractly. In fact, Tarantino's use of chapters and flashbacks piece together each scene in an original and creative way. By rewatching the movie, the sense of familiarity to the characters and story will bring out new details overlooked the first time watched and give viewers a changed perception of the film. To some, the film is about power, explaining the character's actions and motives and the mystery which surrounds Marsellus Wallace. Like abstract art, this film has piqued the creativity and curiosity of many viewers, leading to numerous interpretations and fan theories. 
In addition to all of the visual aspects of the film, Pulp Fiction included a soundtrack that matched the endearing amount of 'coolness' which the film itself possessed. Tarantino again boldly took the path untaken by using music that wasn't particularly popular at the time. In an interview, Tarantino stated that he was completely against the 'cheap' idea of using music to create a sense of period. Instead, he used a variety of obscure tunes to define what the next music trends would be. The movie was largely built around 60's surf music, and has become synonymous with tracks like ""Misirlou."" As a result of this, Tarantino successfully brought a resurgence of surf music into the 90s pop culture. The soundtrack is also filled with many other genres of music other than surf rock. For example, when Marcellus Wallace is focused on in a scene, Tarantino uses funk and soul music to create a mood of powerful calmness that Wallace possesses. As a result of the influence that Pulp Fiction's soundtrack had on pop culture, the film was also able to boast numerous awards from MTV, the Brit awards, and beyond. 
Although some may find the non-chronological organization of Pulp Fiction and the lack of distinguishment between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' confusing, it is one of the most influential movies to date, being referenced in pop culture and growing in popularity over 10 years after its debut. With many awards, hidden details, and a plot which keeps an audience on their toes, the film seems to automatically draw in audiences. The most outstanding attributes to this movie include its dialogue and the soundtrack. Many people can agree that this is a film worth your time, securing a spot as one of the best movies of all time."

25 March 2006,deprivedchild,0,2,10,Vicarious Thrill Unlimited!!,"I saw this movie first 10 years after it was released and every 2 months I watch it again. From the very first scene, it shows the genius of Tarantino. The camera angles, dialog and cast are very much the essence of this film. The movie is non-linear and has captions for each part that add to its charm. The film is full of memorable lines and provides a vicarious thrill not found in other movies. There is no dramatic twist or real plot line so you wish it would go on and on.The deliverance of Ezekiel 25:17 (from the Bible) by Jules seldom seemed so menacing. Jules eventually mocks himself at the end of the movie. Superb soundtrack and the famous ""twist"" scene are bonus to an already super film. Check out Ving Rhames (Marcellus Wallace) parts. They are hilarious. This is how a movie should be made.How this film did not win the best picture Oscar in 1994 is beyond me. (The Shawshank Redemption is another brilliant movie that failed to win the Oscar in 1994) If You haven't seen this film, YOU AIN'T SEEN Nothing' YET!!!!!!! 10 out of 10 Poor Marvin!!!!!!!!!!!!"

25 February 2006,anthonyt100,0,2,10,One of the BEST Movies I've Ever Seen,"I swear, Pulp Fiction has to be the best movie I've ever seen. My parents have never really approved of me seeing this movie, because of all the superficial, though unnerving, violence. But, under that, there's a genius I have never seen before in ANY director. Spielberg has nothing on Quentin Tarantino. The story lines interlock so perfectly, and yet are completely different. And the subtle wise cracks in the dialogue, just complete a totally complete picture. That is what Tarantino separates himself with: attention to detail. Just like the ""Commode story"" in Reservior Dogs, Tarantino makes sure that there are lawn ornaments on the drug dealer's lawn, that there are waiters who dress up very well like older celebrities, and who. it is just amazing, not to mention the unique cinematography, i.e. the characteristic camera angles that only add to the story. Pulp Fiction is a landmark in movies that very few directors could possibly think up. A movie like this won't turn up for at least a few decades."
16 November 2018,daveddevine,0,1,10,Rollercoaster Film,"Hands down my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie. This movie is a rollercoaster in a sense that it offers everything you'd want.

The average action movie viewer is not used to this type of psychological portrayal of violent situations, so the first time they'll see the film they won't get much out of it. Pulp fiction is a fun experience every time, it never grows old on you, the performance of Samuel L. Jackson is arguably the best in all the movie, too bad the supporting actor academy award went to another film. The principal argument that makes this such a captivating movie is the unusual use of spontaneous day to day dialog in the majority of the scenes that would usually been contained in the macho action hero blockbusters.If I would stand and explain all the reasons that make this such a great film it would take me whole pages, but I state this, any film-goer that hasn't seen Pulp Fiction must get their hands as fast as possible on the DVD release!!!"
