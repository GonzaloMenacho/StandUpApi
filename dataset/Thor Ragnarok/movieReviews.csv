12 October 2020,auuwws,22,32,9,Ragnarok,"The best movie for a separate character from a Marvel movie is a very funny movie even though the villain is frustrated. After you smashed Thor's hammer, you didn't do the big thing."
29 October 2017,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,74,143,8,"Destruction and creation, building up and undermining","When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they're stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role's vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn't extend to properly exploring what he's been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).This trilogy has gotten a lot of criticism from the onset, some of it deserved, a lot of it borne out of the natural difficulties with making this kind of world work, especially within the gritty, realistic one Iron Man set up. In this entry, Earth is nearly completely absent, and certainly the only human who has screen-time is Dr. Strange, who is also ""beyond"". Yes, Jane Foster, Darcy and Erik Selvig are gone. Broken up off-screen. I hate that. However, with this newfound freedom, this goes full cosmic. The tone approaches Guardians of the Galaxy. It's superior to Vol. 2, but not up to the level of the original. Honestly, a few minor things seem to be there specifically to redo that, and they'd be better left on the cutting room floor. The jokey subversion/drama mix is not as strong as that, nor of the third Robert Downey Jr. solo picture. With that said, relatively little of the actual weight is lost to laughs. This still has gravity and tension. The action is fast, frequent and enjoyable, if also by far the most MCU aspect of this. Many will find this to be bland, not fun, a corporate product. Certainly, there's still a lot of room for diversity and flavor. Fingers crossed that Black Panther will push the envelope there.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. You can go into this completely blind. Stay through the credits. 8/10"
24 October 2017,coreyjdenford,53,97,8,Bring The Thunder,"This review of Thor: Ragnarok is spoiler free**** (4/5)LIKE CHANTING BETELGUISE'S name, for Marvel products the phrase third time's a charm really works, of course well-earned nods to brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo's Captain America: Civil War which accomplished all fears for its enchanting, eye-shattering Leipzig airport battle scene having the heroes involved showing what they can do, the standout there was Black Panther and the introduction of the newer, younger much improved Spider-Man. Then we had Shane Black's turn at Iron Man 3 which vastly improved on its predecessor. Now the third and final entry in the Thor series is one of the most ridiculous, most hilarious adventures Marvel has ever produced, it's essentially like eating a badger sandwich, and no we don't know what that is either. This daftness comes from none other than New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the most bizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilarious vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and secondly Hunt For The Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in a hat made from a collinder. However Thor: Ragnarok is his most ridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworth's Thor is hurled from the bifrost he's captured on a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universe's trash can, under the rule of Jeff Goldblum's daft, yet tyrannical Grandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80s factory complete with a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot of Goldbluminess, he's funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate fight against his champion - Hulk's (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really no surprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause particularly with the well-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorial coliseum which can't escape Thor's scream of joy and a few quick-witted jokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe the Asghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a vicious attack from Cate Blanchett's goddess of death Hela looking a tad like Alice Cooper's twisted sister complete with a horned helmet for ferocity. Sadly her performance is the film's weakest point, she doesn't exactly come with Galadriel's strength or depth she's not Marvel's best villain, though a better improvement over Thor: The Dark World's Dark Elves. She's not in many scenes and when she does appear her delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost is an improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenes are along the same lines as James Gunn's unadulterated joy for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penis gags aplenty which is a vast improvement over the previous two films' barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose here. Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having his hair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa Thompson's surly Valkyrie who can't stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving her performance some emotion. Yet there's humour to them too they each share their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has to offer, the three arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamed final fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't come without its flaws it's not utterly thunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are a little CG heavy there's a lot going on in a few shots it can be difficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be on occasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CG images on show, here the destruction of Asghard though upsetting for the fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plus this is the most impressive vision of Hulk yet, he's still a wonder to watch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilarious jokes he lets free to the film's final fight he's relentless and utterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home here in the huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulk's chamber he allows you to breathe with the world he has created here. The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldest adventures Marvel has ever created does it bring on the thunder? You're damn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80s style finale."
31 October 2017,PyroSikTh,44,80,8,Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!,"Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.Ragnarok is jam-packed full of jokes and gags, and every single one of them lands with aplomb. From Thor asking Surtur to pause while he helplessly spins around at the beginning, to the Grandmaster declaring a tie in Sakaar's revolution, each and every slither of humour is guaranteed to earn a laugh. It's typical Waititi humour; awkward, modern, and using juxtaposition to great effect. Korg, a large being made of rocks, talking about his revolution failing because he didn't hand out enough pamphlets hits so hard because it's so against what you'd expect from that kind of alien.Waititi's also in his element with running jokes, coming into a franchise nearly twenty movies in full of continuity to adhere to, poke fun at, and address in one way or another. Loki taking Odin's place in Asgard is dealt with swiftly, with a couple of gags thrown in, including surprise cameos. Hulk disappearing at the end of Age of Ultron is addressed with heartbreak and a couple of touching moments between Thor and Hulk/Banner. And Hela knocking over the Infinity Gauntlet in Asgard's vault because it's ""fake"" was a great way to plug such a tiny yet significant plot hole.Despite how humorous Ragnarok is, it doesn't shy away from more serious themes and ideas though. Thor's companions in the Warriors Three are dispatched of quickly and without remorse, Hela raising an army of the dead from the Asgard crypts is a pretty dark idea, and of course there's the whole Ragnarok thing. Not only is this movie one of the funniest entries in the MCU, but it also has some of the biggest stakes so far. By the end of the film, Thor's life is permanently changed in a massive way. But Ragnarok is still not perfect. It still doesn't quite reach the heights of either of the Guardians movies or Winter Soldier. It's opening act feels a little messy, rushing through plot points to get to the meat of it. Thor's tied up in chains at the behest of Surtur, now he's in Asgard unveiling Loki, now he's with Doctor Strange looking for Odin, now he's in Norway bracing for Hela's arrival, now he's on Sakaar about to face the Grandmaster's champion. It's almost all rushed, and some of it feels pointless. Like, Doctor Strange's role is completely unnecessary. He's just put in for an Earthling presence in a movie that frankly didn't need it.Hela is also another in a long line of lacklustre MCU villains. She's the first female villain to pose as the main antagonist, which is great, and Cate Blanchett is perfect for her (I think I'm in love). She has an interesting backstory, but it's never really developed. Hela ends up just becoming another two-dimensional mustache- twirling villain with a plan that's flawed from the offset and no motivation beyond just being evil. Her being the Goddess of Death is never really capitalised on either, outside of her resurrecting dead soldiers of Asgard's crypts reasonably early on.That said, almost every other character is great. Thor's sense of humour is brought to the forefront with some surprisingly great comedic chops from Hemsworth, without it taking away from his more serious moments. He's still Thor despite the tonal shift around him. Likewise, Loki is the same old Loki, with his tricks and betrayals, and his history with Hulk is played up to perfection. Valkyrie and Skurge both enjoy character arcs that help to develop them, and both Tessa Thompson and Karl Urban make their mark on the movie. Waititi even gets to add some of himself into the movie as Korg, who promises to steal every scene he's in. And of course Mark Ruffalo manages to play Hulk completely by himself for the first time and gives us the best Hulk we've ever had.Ragnarok is another part of Marvel's current hot streak, and here's hoping it continues just a little bit longer at least. It's a massive tonal shift from the rest of the Thor franchise, feeling closer to the Guardians franchise, which is a win/lose depending on your point of view. The music is a step in the right direction, utilising Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song really well, as well as adding some 80's synth/video game music underneath Marvel's standard, dull strings arrangements, but it's largely still unmemorable and unremarkable. The visuals are fantastic, employing a style closer to Snyder's approach in the DCEU than Marvel's usual grey realism, which I personally consider a massive plus. But of course it's the humour that keeps Ragnarok afloat, and the massive stakes leave me begging to find out what happens next. I give Ragnarok a high 8/10. Easily the best Thor movie so far.P.S. Where was Sif?!"
20 June 2020,alcantaraj-16594,3,3,7,TOO MANY JOKES,"While better than other MCU solo movies like ""CA: The First Avenger,"" ""Doctor Strange"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and pretty much as good as ""Guardians of the Galaxy, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" has one major flaw that really bothers me: There are too many jokes, even in serious moments.
Also, please bring back Cate Blanchett. She's fantastic in this film and I wish that her character survived"
29 October 2017,FallenEye,90,172,7,"RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?","There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.Thor: Ragnarok could've taken itself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didn't take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so, and ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. It's weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to its fans' will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize Comic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?Tension is one of storytelling's best and greatest tools, and Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvel's doing, or is it the fans/critics/audience? Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89% from critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics and 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve after The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain America: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.I love dark, serious, tense. Ragnarok is not that for the most part, but it's still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like Thor and Loki's moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years we've wondered how Thor would react to Loki's impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.I think Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something loose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps didn't have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.Ragnarok being this ""light"" also, could work very well for Infinity War, as long as IW is ""hella"" dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.I will say this though, if Infinity War takes Ragnarok's path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that has been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any MCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in, there maybe more to what meets the eye.Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10."
28 October 2017,EthanBJones_03,35,63,8,Recommended,"​*THIS REVIEW'LL BE MOSTLY SPOILER FREE. I'LL TELL YOU BEFORE A SPOILER*'THOR: RAGNAORK' - 2017Directed by Taika_Waititi{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}Starring Chris_Hemsworth{In the Heart of the Sea}, Cate_Blanchett{Carol} and Tom_Hiddleston Kong: Skull Island}Plot_Overview: Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thor's quest for survival leads him in a race against time to prevent the omnipotent Hela from destroying his homeworld and the Asgardian civilisation.So far, I've been disappointed by Thor's solo outings. The first was average at best and I consider The Dark World to be a quite frankly awful movie. Therefore, I had NO expectations going in and ignored the overwhelmingly positive reviews. But after watching it, I loved it. And while I don't agree that it's this legendary titan of cinema that some are declaring it as, I certainly think that it's a VERY fun and enjoyable way to spend a couple hours of your time. If you like superhero movies, be sure to check it out.What SPECIFICALLY is good about this film? The drastic change in tone and style is probably by biggest praise. For me, Thor's previous outings have been dull and monotonous chores to get through so the new focus on comedy was welcome to me. And thankfully a lot of the jokes hit bullseyes. I was laughing constantly throughout this movie; it was a genuine COMEDY.The action sequences in this movie were excellent and thoroughly entertaining. They were also, thankfully, well shot; like the rest of this movie. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is an excellently shot, edited and lit movie. Javier Aguirresarobe does an EXCELLENT job in shooting this movie. Combine this with the jaw dropping effects and 3D and you have one heck of a good looking movie.Chris Hemsworth was an actor I didn't like before. I've always thought he was very one note and had a limited range. This movie proves otherwise. Hemsworth does excellent in the action sequences of this movie, but also has an excellent sense of humour and fulfils the quota for a couple dramatic moments reasonably well. I commend the man for proving me wrong. Accompanying Thor is his quirky brother, Loki, as portrayed by Tom 'Hiddlesticks' Hiddlseton. Hiddlesticks was great in 'Thor', eh in 'Avengers Assemble', okay in 'Thor: The Dark World' and, I'm pleased to announce, great in Ragnarok. Hiddlesticks delivers his best performance of the year(screw Skull Island) and returns to form as the extremely charismatic Loki, that we all love to hate. Mark Ruffallo{Avengers Assemble} also co-starred. Granted, he is Hulk for the majority of the run time but for the moments he's not, he does a great job. Expanding on the decision to include Hulk, I liked it. They certainly give Hulk a lot more personality, and make him feel a lot more relevant to the plot, unlike in other movies. Hulk is now a CHARACTER, no longer a giant green monster that smashes stuff. But don't worry, he is still a good smasher. Tessa Thompson{Selma} also appears in the movie as Valkyrie. Thompson does a reasonable job as this character and succeeds in the action segments of the movie. Alas, I don't think she was that good in the more sombre moments, or at making jokes. Jeff Goldblum is my spirit animal. I love the man as an actor and I thought he was pitch perfect in this movie. He's one of the brighter spots of the movie, despite not appearing in it THAT much.As for issues, I unfortunately have a couple. Firstly, the story was very weak and the conclusion unsatisfying. The concept of 'Ragnarok' is a TERRIFYING idea, especially for the characters on screen. But it's not really that important to the plot. In fact, it's brought up at the start and then once more at the very end. So I don't really see the point in labelling the film as it. The actual story that we got was a very dull one. I wasn't expecting much but the story was so meaningless and pointless that I really wish more time was put into it. Furthermore, I also hated the conclusion of this movie. I was very disappointed about something. The thing I was disappointed about is TECHNICALLY a spoiler so if you have watched the movie, please read on. But if not, then please skip to the next paragraph from now!!!! Right, the thing that I wish happened but did not, was that I wish that Thor_would have been killed off. I know that may seem morbid but it's true. 'Ragnarok' means the end of everything, so what better of a way to have one of the movies that lead into Infinity War, have a main character die. It'd bring stakes back to this universe and give the Avengers something to Avenge. And I think it's be an EXCELLENT way to wrap this film, and Thor's saga, up.Okay, there are no more spoilers no so feel free to read on. My second major issue with this movie is Cate Blanchett and the villain. I understand that Marvel's villains aren't typically good, but even by their standards: this was pretty poor. Hela, who is the GODDESS OF DEATH, is the villain of this movie and guess what she does? Sit in corner for the entire movie and contribute NOTHING to the plot. There was no point to her being there. In fact, I believe this film would've been better without a villain, and just have it be a buddy comedy. Blanchett wasn't AWFUL as Hela but she wasn't that good. It was a passable performance.Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun and a passable way to end the Thor saga. I definitely recommend you watch. I'll rate it 8 'Haircuts' out of 10!"
25 October 2017,mjplysaght,53,96,9,Now THAT'S how you make a Thor film!!,"Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among the weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and they were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughout is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the motion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being bogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of the piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of her life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must put aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their dynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing the Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forces Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's your classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lot of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is also great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the music was brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats would deliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for the God of Thunder!!!"
1 November 2017,brankovranjkovic,35,65,9,THOR Ragnarok – the best of the 3 standalone's,"This is the third standalone Marvel 'Thor' film, a swashbuckling superhero fantasy that continues directly after where 'The Dark World' ends. The premise is that Asgard is in peril, Thor's objective is to prevent the destruction of his home planet. This film introduces the villain 'Hela', she is the Goddess of Death, she is also Thor's sister, who has been in exile for many years and appears to be a very powerful character, possibly more powerful than Thor! During a particularly colourful action sequence, Thor is transported to a remote 'dump' of a world, on the other side of the Universe, this planet is full of rubbish and discarded people and is ruled by the weirdo 'Grandmaster' outstandingly played by Jeff Goldblum. In order for Thor to get back, he first needs to beat the champion gladiator, who happens to be the 'HULK'. This is also the point where we're introduced to another excellent show stealing character, 'Korg', voiced by the director Taika.The entire film is full of relentless adult comedy sketches and humorous dialogue, which was inspired by the humour and success of Guardians of the Galaxy. With a great soundtrack, this is a hugely entertaining film that balances humor with drama. Highly recommended."
5 November 2017,Veritas99,77,146,1,Biggest disappointment ever,"If I wanted (which I DON'T) to see a movie with clowns, I would go to one. I am sorry I didn't read the reviews, I would have a hint... Anyway, transforming Thor in a goofy clown, and all the lousy jokes in an apparently serious situation (Asgard in danger, etc...) made me sorry for the money I paid for the ticket. I didn't want a lousy comedy, I wanted a Thor sequel, and I got a stew made from old Thor recipe plus goofy jokes - apparently they wanted to touch all possible segments of audience - they could include some porn and some vampires and they would have everything. I hope the actors got some fat paychecks, as a consolation for degrading themselves for playing in this one."
1 November 2017,garethvk,36,64,9,The Best Thor Outing Too Date,"One of the biggest challenges with an ongoing series is crafting a story that is on par or better than the prior offering and that the characters continue to grow so audiences do not get a rehash of what they have seen before.With ""Thor Ragnarok"" Chris Hemsworth has returned for his third solo outing, and fifth outing overall as the heroic Asgardian warrior Thor. This time out Thor is on his quest to track down the Infinity Stones and finds himself plagued by visions of Ragnarok: a legend detailing the fiery destruction of his home of Asgard.With an action laden opening, Thor believes he has ended the threat and returns home to find his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), has been sent to Earth and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assuming his place.Thor ventures to Earth with his brother which sets a series of events into motion, the result of which unleashes the long imprisoned Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans the subjugation of Thor and Asgard. Naturally Thor is not going to put up with this, but finds himself mid battle knocked out of his transit home and on a remote world called Sakaar.As if being stranded far from home is not enough of a challenge, Thor is forced to become a gladiator for the erratic Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), whom Loki has managed to charm and become a part of his inner circle.As fate has it, Thor becomes matched with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and must find a way to survive and make his way home before Hella can destroy all that he holds precious.The film is the best of the Thor films and it is engaging from start to finish. There is a significant amount of humor in the film but it does not feel forced and is very appropriate to many of the scenes. The film also has plenty of action and the blend between comedy and action is deftly handed by Director TaiKa Waititi who never lets the film become a parody of itself nor take itself too seriously at times. He knows when there is a time to laugh and when there is a time to be deathly serious.This allows for a deeper and more enjoyable and engaging Thor than has been previously seen. He is not as one-dimensional as he has been in the past as the strong, quick to anger muscle that I would love to see explored in further outings.I had worried from the trailers that the movie might be more of a video game as it seemed heavily dependent on retro style CGI and camp humor which made it seem like something out of the 80s. While there are elements of that, the film mixes the old and new to create one of the most authentic and enjoyable comic adaptations seen to date. It continues the winning formula of Marvel Studios and of course, sets up the next outing for Thor in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" as well as the larger Marvel Universe as we a whole. The film also has some great cameos and I am curious to see how the addition of the newly introduced characters will be explored down the road. The return of Hiddleston was also a real treat as he is so good as the mercurial but always sly and dangerous Loki that he commands your complete attention every time he appears on screen.Marvel has once again set very high standards for comic based movies and has again delivered another winner that you will not want to miss.4.5 stars out of 5."
16 October 2017,MiroslavKyuranov,417,833,10,Madness!,"This movie is one hell of a journey!The story is right out of Jack Kirby pages and combines all kind of tones (serious, sad, funny). The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealisticly good. Hela is one of the best MCU villains so far! Cate Blanchett just killing it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous ""Thor"" movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ""Revengers"" team, such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome.The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three ""Thor"" movies. Firstly. because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies.Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard Marvel fan, I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his significant role and there are some Huge connections that'll lead to ""Infinity War"" and you'll lose your mind when you see them.MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!"

                        ",So Bad,"In the comics, Ragnarok killed every Asgardian, including Thor, and he was gone for years from the comics. The darkest story in Thor's history.So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It's quips, pratfall, anus jokes, Hela's kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thor helps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeat that in case I wasn't clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.It's just so bad.Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn't work in this movie.At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their main focus.Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU and will just pretend they're masterpieces when they're not. This movie was terrible.Critics call it ""FUUUUNNNN"". But it was just lame.I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burned it I still would have wasted money but I wouldn't have sat through this.It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be a bloated mess."
28 October 2017,pixiekatten,47,83,9,Easily the best Thor movie!,"Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew me away. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without doubt the best one. Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I am mid-30s and I had some really good laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If you're like me and not reading too much about the films and what characters they'll feature, before going to see them then you'll get a nice surprise. Also some new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack you up. Everyone does a good job in this film though. Loke is still a bit of a scene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roost completely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyries flashback scene is beautiful. Fight scenes have you excited! And frankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves an extra star! I have no problem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It is up there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great addition to the MCU."
28 October 2017,taranpannu01,51,91,7,Ragnarok (2017),"After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi would be directing this as his previous films, 'Boy', 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' were just amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we could've seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as The God of Mischief.Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually really enjoyed Urban's English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word. Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into this role and she had some great moments.The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is just sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Director's lack of experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film flowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable.Cate Blanchett was a bit meh for me, she was good but she just wasn't very memorable. Tessa Thompson was just boring. Uninspiring and uncharismatic and sadly that was the result of the actress not the writer. Some of the effects were a bit naff, they were a bit ragdolly and some shots in Norway were clearly a green screen. But that comes with the inexperience of a big budget with Taika.The biggest con of this film was what happened to the Warriors Three as they were legitimately some of the best parts of the previous Thor films. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and especially Tadanobu Asano deserved much more then to be unceremoniously killed off with barely putting up a fight. Such a shame, a massive shame.Overall this film is fun, exciting and a really enjoyable experience, there are some minor flaws that tarnish the overall film but this is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a great boost to brilliant director Taika Waititi."
8 November 2017,ironhorse_iv,15,28,8,"It's Hammer Time! Is Thor: Ragnarok, worth watching? Yes, it is!","Unfortunately, it takes one of the most popular Hulk comic book stories ever, 'Planet Hulk', to make 'Thor: Ragnarok', the most entertaining 'Thor' movie yet. Honestly to tell you, the truth. It's a good thing. While, all three 'Thor' movies, have a similar generic premise, in which, an alien force is trying to conquer the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a super-weapon, with this one being Thor's lost-long sister, Hela (Cate Blachett), with Blachett doing a good job, playing sinister, sexy and deadly, even if her character come out of nowhere, unexplained. At least, this movie directed by Taika Waititi & written from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost was a lot more memorable than its counterpart. I can hardly remember, 2011's 'Thor' & 2013's ""Thor: the Dark World' in the years, after both movies came out, at all. This one, honestly stands out. First off, most of the action, takes place, off-world, outside of Earth & the Ninth Realms, giving a lot more, bright & crazy looking, sci-fi vibe, mixed with its fantasy elements. This allow us, to get away from the annoying, human characters such as Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) & Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), whom in the last movie, pretty much, phone her performance, in. None of them, return. Sadly, this also eliminates, the Warrior Three such as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fandral (Zachary Levi), but at least, they had cameos in this film, even if short. Still, it cools to see that Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is still around. However, Alexander's absence in the film, does beg the question. Why, wasn't Sif in Asgard!? Nevertheless, this change in direction, allows new likable supporting characters to emerge, such as Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who does a pretty good job & Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to shine. While, director, Waititi did an alright motion-capture performance for Krog, a gladiator that Thor befriends. His soft-spoken, Australian accent was a bit jarring for something that came from Norse mythology. The same goes, with Karl Urban as Skruge, whom machine gun mow down scene was really bizarre. Nevertheless, I love how the film is not so bog down with complex, confusing Norse mythology, as the other movies; giving more room for simpler story lines like a prison escape subplot to breathe. While, yes, the whole gladiator fight/revolution plot for the most part, doesn't mesh well, with the main 'Ragnarok' story, in which the movie is title, from. It's still entertaining even with big plot-holes like how the wormholes honestly works, why nobody use the tesseract to get anywhere and how Hulk got to Sakaar, in the first place. Nevertheless, it's cool, that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still the title character, not Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), throughout this, even if it came from a Hulk comic book. The direction for this film, could easily be, misguide with Hulk getting revenge on the Avengers, but they stay focus on Thor trying to get back on his home world. I also enjoy, how the movie took more risk, with the title character. Seeing Thor, have short hair & without his trademark hammer Mjolnir was really shocking. Lucky for the writers & Hemsworth. Most of the risk paid off. Nevertheless, I can still do, without the badly gone, CGI eye injury. It was so fake-looking. It kinda distract me from enjoying the climax. The other special effects were good, but not great. While, none of the CGI in the film, look, deeply realistic. At least, it's beautiful to look at. It match well with the deliberately '80s space opera aesthetic and synth score, composed by new wave band, Devo's bandleader, Mark Mothersbaugh. Additional music featured in the film include ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin and ""Pure Imagination"" from the 1971's film 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was also a nice tough. Another highlight from 'Thor: Ragnarok"" is the humor. It was really cheeky & funny, as it really was going for that, 2014's Marvel film, 'Guardian of the Galaxy', sci-fi comedy vibe. Hemsworth really look like, he was enjoying, playing Thor, this time. His performance really made the film, very fun to watch. I glad, he didn't get bored. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, was also nice to see, however, I really getting tired, of the heel/baby-face, working, together, vibe. It was cool in 'Thor: the Dark World'. Here, not so much. I really was, hoping for something new. Still, I did like the cameo of Matt Damon, Sam Neill & Luke Helmsworth, stage-acting out the climax of the last movie, to Thor & Loki. It was a unique touch. It's also cool to see, that Stan Lee is still around, at his age, doing Marvel cameos, as well. I hope that day, where he can't, never comes. Furthermore, along with the Easter eggs, film references, it was also cool to see, characters performers like Benedict Cumberbatch & Scarlett Johansson reprises their roles as Stephen Strange from the film 2016's 'Doctor Strange' & 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. This includes, the mid-credit scenes. Without spoiling it, they really do help set up, 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity War', big time. Can't wait for that movie to come out! Overall: This movie deserves a thunderous applause. While, deeply cartoonish & somewhat childish. 'Thor: Ragnorok"" was a feel good fun romp fantasy escape movie. Highly watchable. Highly recommended."
25 October 2017,darcywinchester,80,153,10,Joyous escapism,"In this Taika Waititi (Boy, What we do in the Shadows) directed film, written by Eric Pearson (Marvel One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, Marvel One Shot: The Consultant), Craig Kyle (Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs.), Christopher Yost (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars: Rebels), based on comics by Stan Lee (Iron Man, Thor), Larry Lieber (Iron Man, Thor) and Jack Kirby (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron) and starring Chris Hemsworth (Rush, Ghostbusters) as Thor.After taking the crown from Surtur (Clancy Brown: The Shawshank Redemption, TVs Daredevil), he returns it to his homeland where Thor finds that his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Thor, TVs The Night Manager) has taken over Asgard and hidden Odin (Anthony Hopkins: Silence of the Lambs, Thor) on Earth, but upon his death, Hela (Cate Blanchett: The Lord of the Rings, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) God of Death and their powerful sister, comes to take the throne for herself. Thrown across the Universe, Thor is first captured by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson: Selma, TVs Westworld), sold to Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum: Jurassic Park, Independence Day) and held captive on the planet Sakaar where he and other warriors, including Korg (an inspired turn by director Taiki Waititi), are forced to fight for his entertainment. Ultimately Thor is pitted against The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo: Avengers Assemble, Now You See Me), but without his hammer, can Thor not only win his gladiatorial duel against his former Avenger friend but also convince and assemble a team (Hulk, Valkyrie and his untrustworthy brother) to stop Hela and prevent Ragnarok, the doom of the Asgarian civilisation? This action, adventure, comedy film hit all the right notes for me. The humour was spot on, right up my street (think Deadpool), and this and the action never felt forced. All the actors were on their A game and for me, a huge Loki fan, I have to admit that in his own small way, Korg stole the movie like Loki did in Thor. Not even the turn from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, TVs Sherlock) could beat it.I was pleased that Hela, the main villain, got her character arc as this has been lacking in some previous Marvel films and has for me left the baddies flat, and this time the epic fight scenes bookend the serious moments well. As perturbing as it was for a fan of the mythology for Hela and Fenrir to be used not as Loki's children, it worked for the film and Goldblum's wackiness gelled as well as Samuel L Jackson's bad guy Valentine in Kingsman. Yes it is awful when they summarily kill off some favourite characters, in some cases notably without even giving them a line, and concentrate more on Skurge (Karl Urban: Star Trek, The Bourne Supremacy) but here too they give him a meaningful character arc, he wants to be worthy and he gets his chance. Heimdall (Idris Elba: Prometheus, Pacific Rim) is busy trying to hide and save as many innocent Asgardians as he can while Hela searches for the sword that will help her start the apocalypse for other worlds. And though Banner worries that allowing himself to turn back into the Hulk may leave him that way forever, he too gets his emotional scenes when we see the cameo of Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson: We Bought a Zoo, Lucy) and his chance to shine against the terrifying Fenrir.The soundtrack is epic in its own right, up there with GOTG1, and the film does not feel like more of the same (as some of the superhero movies have sadly started feeling), it feels back to its best. If this is to be the last Thor movie, then they gave him a great one to bow out.Yes the movie had a few flaws (e.g. Thor has never wanted the power of ruling, Banner may stay as the Hulk), but as the best way to describe the film is pure fun, I am going to give it 10/10 despite these because that is just what most people need at the moment, joyous escapism."
23 June 2021,kaden_lewis,11,18,10,Thor: Ragnarok,"Amazing! This was the best Thor movie and it isn't even close. This one was superior in so many ways. This one had a great plot, a good story, great acting, amazing directing, a different genre, and a better tone. I personally loved the plot of Thor and Loki looking for Odin, then finding him as he is dying. Then, because Odin's powers were the only thing keeping her locked up, Thor and Loki's older sister Hela appeared and shattered Thor's hammer. Thor and Loki then get stranded on Sakar where they find The Hulk who disappeared after Avengers: Age of Ultron. They then teamed up with a former Valkyrie to try and stop Hela from conquering more than just the nine realms. The story was also great, I loved the emotion during Odin's death, and I loved how they were able to tie in Age of Ultron when the Hulk went missing. I feel the writers did a great job. I thought the acting was the best from all the Thor movies, especially the acting for the villain, I loved how Heimdal was portrayed instead of whatever he was in the first two. I also loved Taika Waititi's directing. The directors of the first two Thor movies stuck to a very strict way of portraying everything, you could tell the Taika took lots of risks, and they all paid off. I also like how Marvel is diversifying their genres, it seems they like doing the action comedies, and I have no problem with that because they have all been good. Lastly, I liked the change in tone from the first two movies. They were both darker and serious whereas this movie was more lighthearted and funny. I hope Thor: Love and Thunder is the same way.This was a great movie that provided laughs, but still managed to stay serious when it needed too. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it, I just recommend watching the first two Thor's first."
29 October 2017,rumasuk,53,95,8,"Crazy colorful space warrior adventure on the big screen,","The movie is great. It's a new experience. It does have deep flaws that affected my experience though, but a good enjoyable fresh movie overall.The movie will be a pretty fresh experience. 80 percent of it its outer worlds adventure extravaganza. The planets and designs are incredible. The story is pretty cool too. But...My problem with it it's not what some people have pointed out: The movie is way more of a comedy than the previous two. It's just that Taika Waititi didn't care about taking the plot seriously at all, like in purpose. You don't need to have a loose plot to be hilarious and a comedy masterpiece, look at the first Hangover, look at how high the stakes were in that movie. This movie jumps from point a to b without any regard on how or why, a clear example of this is the Hulk. I have expected since Age of Ultron for marvel to answer how Hulk left for another planet and the answer is ""He just did""? This is true for all the plot points in the movie. This is just the sort of thing the Russos would have polished completely while keeping all the jokes.I thought the story was full of missed opportunities (Fan Fic incoming, skip if you hate Fan Fic mindsets) why not have the hammer be a limitation of Thor's true power created by Odin to limit him so what happened to Hela becoming evil and unstoppable never happens to him. Making not only Thor's unlocking of his true potential logical but also symbolical now that he lives in a world where his father, the most powerful man wont be there to protect his world. The Thor Hulk fight was cool as hell, even if it was a little simple, it looked incredible. They gave it a definitive space pay per view filter or something. It looked awesome. Hela was cool as well. AND HERE's my biggest defense for the whole movie: Thor himself was great. It felt Waititi designed the whole process of the movie on getting who Chris Hemsworth is, how (Chris Hemsworth) HE sees Thor not how Kevin Feige or Marvel or we the fans have told him to act. How he could actually connect with a Thor he was frankly disconnected from more and more. And I think in this aspect for what the movie is, they had a freaking home run. Hemsworth is fresh again and better than ever. He is awesome, he is Thor and he enjoys it. It feels more like a psychological acting directorial procedure milestone more than a movie merit. But directors should look at whatever Waititi did, because he might have unlocked Chris Hemsworth potential to be awesome to watch on camera. There you have something I can not stop giving props to. So yeah objectively a 7/10 but I would re watch this a thousand times over the 2 previous ones. Also I can not give enough merit on how this movie readjusted Thor incredibly well without him feeling at all like a new character or forced in any way. Its just great overall.I would like to see him in other movies. He could have a serious role in a war movie or a criminal thriller. Hemsworth rocked, and Loki as much as I hated him in the past due to his popularity is freaking incredible as he has always been."
13 November 2017,dumitrescu-robert92,569,1141,1,"Joke, jokes, more jokes","Was this movie a crappy comedy? Why so many people liked it so much? What was this movie about? What was the purpose of all the jokes? Is this only for kids?Things that bothered me: Ragnarok is supposed to mean the end of the ""world"" but no one took it seriously. Hela is about to conquer the world and kill everybody let's make a little joke. A fight started, oh, please, another little joke. Thor steps on a banana and falls down, ahahaha, funny. Loki - 0 power in all the movie, 0 spells, 0 abilities, just nothing, where was his power, he was so useless and did almost nothing in all the movie. Hulk - personality of a teenage boy on steroids. Thor - so funny, oh my god, joke after joke. Is he THOR or the kid of Deadpool?I had so high expectations but this movie targeted only the kids with all the not funny jokes."
16 April 2021,adamsmith-51004,7,10,8,"""He's A Friend From Work!""","Thor: Ragnarok has been touted as the bezt film in the Thor trilogy, and it's not hard to see why. Taking over from Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor, Taika Waititi adds a touch of weird to the God of Thunder's adventures. Add Taika's unique, zany style to a fun story, fun characters, and plenty of action, and we've got a memorable conclusion to Thor's solo series.This movie follows Thor as he is tossed from Asgard all the way to the planet Sakaar and forced to compete in a tournament for his freedom. With the help of his brother Loki, newcomer Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and his fellow Avenger the Hulk, Thor must fight his way back to Asgard and stop his sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) from taking it over and bringing about Ragnarok, the end of all things. All the principle cast members from the previous Thor movies return, and other cast members include Jeff Goldblum, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Karl Urban.Ragnarok marks a pretty big shift in tone from the previous Thor movies, in that it takes itself far less seriously and pretty much plays everything for a laugh. The movie basically pokes fun at itself and pretty much every other MCU movie. In other words, it's a very meta movie. Even the characters don't really take anything seriously; they basically play it like it's nothing they haven't seen before, which is pretty much true.I'm sure that some were disappointed that Natalie Portman's Jane didn't return, and may find the tone shift jarring, but it doesn't bother me too much. Plus, we've got plenty of newer characters to make up for Jane's absence. Tessa Thompson is great as Valkyrie, who's a very goofy warrior with a drinking problem. Beneath the alcoholism, though, lies some deep trauma and a complicated past. Jeff Goldblum plays the Grandmaster, who's basically Jeff Goldblum in a brightly-colored robe. He has many funny moments, and I wouldn't mind seeing him again in the future. And Taika Waititi gets to play a character named Korg, a rock-monster who's very funny and becomes an instant favorite.Hela is a pretty inventive villain. Some retconning is done to fit her into Thor's history, but it works pretty well. Blanchett's performance is excellent, as she gets to villain it up while wearing a pointy crown on her head, which is basically her hair when she slicks it back. She's also able to conjure up weapons from her arms, making her unpredictable against Thor. Karl Urban plays her henchman Skurge, and while he isn't the most threatening bad guy, he also gets moments of hilarity and nuance here.Chris Hemsworth is given a chance to explore Thor's wackier side, and it works to great effect. Thor gets several funny moments in this movie, especially with his partners-in-crime. He has several moments with Loki that are especially a riot. Speaking of Loki, he's a standout as always, and this time it's not to the detriment of the other characters. The Thor/Loki relationship is explored further in Ragnarok, and it leads to Thor accepting that maybe his relationship with his brother will never be the way he imagined.Ragnarok partially adapts the Marvel Comics storyline Planet Hulk, and the Hulk himself is utilized more than he has been in the past. The Hulk is given a bigger role, as we begin to see the conflict between Hulk and Banner really present itself. It doesn't hurt that the Hulk is now able to actually speak, and he gets several great one-liners. The movie also gives Thor and Banner more interaction than in past Avengers movies, and it's fun to watch them team up. Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a brief-but-fun cameo as Doctor Strange; he doesn't play a huge role in the grand scheme of things, but it's still fun to see him one last time before Infinity War.It's not all goofiness in Ragnarok; at the heart of it all is Thor accepting his role as King of Asgard, and his desire to live up to his father Odin's legacy has formed the backbone of his arc in the MCU. And things begin to take a dark turn by the time the credits roll...."
9 November 2017,alvmanalm,325,647,1,Thor Wreck-narok!,"Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time..."
30 October 2017,jpatrick-68632,47,84,8,Hunt for the WilderThor,"Me'n the missus were looking forward to seeing Thor: Ragnarok. We'd seen the shorts and were impressed. So off we hopped to see it in a manner that holders of the 'Holy Seniors Card' grandly imagine to be 'nimble'. It was made in Australia and has Australians in it and some New Zealanders too who aren't yet famous enough to be claimed as Australians.Odin, Thor's dad has flown the coop and left Asgard to live in Norway and look at the ocean. Thor, and his brother 'Loki the Dodgy', go to visit him via Dr Strange in a bit that I didn't quite understand. Loki, I discovered is/was Taylor Swift's squeeze! Thanks, Doctors waiting room magazines! Next visit I'll try and find out who Taylor Swift is.Odin tells the Thorster that he isn't really the firstborn and he has a big sister and she has been hidden away because she is temperamentally questionable, in the manner of a youth who might feature in the first episode of a 'Kids who Commit Genocide' documentary series is temperamentally questionable. Not only is she super-mean, but she's really REALLY strong and has no need of a hammer; she has attitude! She is called Hela but is really darkside Galadriel who has covered her ears up. Being the firstborn she has dibs on the throne.Thor ends up in a sort of fighting pit run by Wilderpeople and Jurassic Park'ers. I didn't really understand how he got there except there was a drunk chick involved. Doesn't really matter, but. It was pretty funny. Thor meets Korg who is a gladiatorial support act made out discarded drystone and is one of my favouritest characters. They become friends. Thor takes his shirt off and there was a sharp intake of breath from the female audience members, as well as the two blokes sitting behind us. He also gets a haircut.Thor fights the Hulk in the fighting pit. How the Hulk got there isn't explained but it doesn't really matter. It's a good fight too! I want to know who makes the Hulk's trouser because I too have gotten heaps bigger over time and a pair of expanda-pants would be handy.There is a sort of alliance formed and they all head off to Asgard to take care of Darkside Galadriel/Hela. It's not going to be easy. Making up a name for the alliance is tricky too.There is a big battle and 'Immigrant Song' is played. I still think it should be our national anthem. I grandly consider myself a visionary, and as such it is my lot to have my great ideas ignored. I won't ruin it by telling who wins.Is it any good? YessirreeeBob. It's directed by the same person who directed 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and that is a fave. He's a New Zealander at the moment but we'll adopt him soon. It's good enough that I'll prolly buy it on Blu-ray and take it away on golf trips to entertain the drunks."
28 October 2017,The-Sarkologist,20,42,7,Great Movie but for ...,"If I had just gone by the previews, and not been so caught up in the Marvel storyline, I probably would have given this movie a miss. Well, it turned out that it was just Cate Blaunchett's really bad acting (or overacting). It seemed as if she really couldn't play a superhero bad guy, or even sit well in a superhero movie. Sure, she may have won and Oscar or two, but this role was certainly not Oscar worthy (not that any of the Marvel films ever make it into the Oscar fields as it is). In fact her portrayal of Hella was so bad that I literally cringed whenever she opened her mouth.Anyway, the film begins with Thor in a cage. He has been travelling the galaxy looking for the infinity stones, with little to no luck, and is now a prisoner of Surtur, one of the Asgardian bad guys. Anyway, to cut a long story short, and after an awesome rendition of The Immigrant Song by Led Zepplin, he defeats Surtur and finally returns to Asgard to discover that Loki is up to his old tricks again. Unfortunately this latest trick has resulted in Odin's death, and their sister Hella being set free to rampage over Asgard. Meanwhile Thor and Loki are banished to a trash world where they (or at least Thor) needs to escape. Along the way he also discovers that The Hulk has also landed up here.This isn't a new story, if fact it is one that I have seen time and time again. The hero is banished from his home and a malevolent force takes over. The Hero must escape the prison, return to his home, and defeat the bad guy. Sounds simple, well not quite, because this is Ragnarok, which basically signals the end of Asgard. While the story was old hat, and Blaunchett horrible, the execution was near perfect. Interestingly the director was born in New Zealand, and when he appeared in a pre-opening scene, I suddenly discovered that he played a minor role in the film (the South Pacific accent stands out a mile, at least where I'm concerned).Oh, I should also mention the jokes. As one reviewer pointed out these later Marvel Movies seem to be really ramping up on the humour, and in part it is starting to ruin them. Some of them are really good, but others of them are forced and unnecessary. In fact a part of it seems to be turning into something like Galaxy Quest than a serious science-fantasy superhero movie, which is actually a little disturbing. For instance the name of the singularity that they used to escape from the garbage world was quite unnecessary. Still, it is a pretty good movie, but I do feel that they need to start toning down on the humour a little."
28 October 2017,alinfatu,57,101,7,Asgard is Dead,"The concept of Ragnarok for a Thor finale was unexpected and amazing especially since the Norse myths on which the event is based on and the comic arc is based on were great sources for this movie and I think Taika read exactly none of them.The whole grandiose Ragnarok was the 5 minutes Surtur trashed Asgard.As for the characters:1)Thor:Had some development,learned to work together with people,trust in his power and the responsibility of a leader,after 3 movies he just learned that.His attitude towards the whole situation was unnecessary to be honest,most of the times he felt like he either didn't care or was unaware of the real danger.I liked that for once he could stand his own against Hela(for a while),defeated Hulk and the monsters in Hell and Hela's army of the dead.I loved his version of Thorforce(his true potential).2)Hulk/Banner:It finally gave the big guy some development,some conciseness,some feelings of his own,it was good to see him caring for his friends and acting like a sentient being for once.It was refreshing to see the man and the beast coming at terms with their mutual need for each other.I don't really understand yet why Banner would disappear forever if he ever should turn into Hulk again,which he did.So is Bruce forever gone? 3)Hela:Blanchett by far was the best part of the movie,her stellar performance and her look were amazingly accurate to the comics,she looked convincing and acted royal and for once I saw an evil character enjoying her colors and proudly wearing them.Personality wise she was Hela mixed with Angela and Gorr and her powers were mostly drawn from Gorr which while cool was disappointing,her action scenes were cut short,her screen time was unfairly small for the one supposed to be THE VILLAIN of the movie and despite all this she was the best developed character in the movie in my mind.The most disappointing thing about her and Valkyrie was that their epic fight was reduced to a few shots and that was all,not event a small 3 minutes scene.Her getting stabbed or kicked by the asgardians felt weird since she is presented as Odin's right hand,not that it damages her but looks pretty careless for the general who helped conquer the 9 realms.Also Fenris was reduced to her pet gal dog,while nice to see her it was a very stupid decision.Even if her scenes were meaningful,she was super underutilized. 4)Odin:His death was rushed and I didn't't really feel the tragedy in it,his joke about the God of Hammers was good tho,I would also like to point out that I liked him giving Thor that extra boost of confidence to let his power loose for once.I also loved seeing his true face,a war hungry powerful being,who along his daughter knelled the 9 realms into submission but after all,had a limit which made him question Hela's sanity and purpose in all that.5)Loki:Arounded character since the Avengers,he is in the movie to add to Thor's relationship,has a few good jokes and some nice moments.6)Valkyrie:Thessa did an amazing job playing a legendary warrior,hunted by the past who succumbed to alcohol and man hunting to bury her pain and loss but it was weird how she was so easily convinced to join the Revengers.I loved her suit and her action sequences. 7)Surtur:2nd best addition to the movie,it was great to see him in the beginning,his design was superb but even in his weakened state I felt he was defeated too easily.Him being reborn and fulfilling his destiny while facing Hela was pretty epic but short lived,the true meaning of the movie was brought to life by this guy and he was at his job for 3 minutes or so.8)Grand Master:The character seemed like a Psychotic ruler of a trashy planet,didn't't feel powerful or truly evil,just mad,if that was the intention than bravo to Golblum but I feel the best parts that came of the characters like his speech at the end,the talk in the arena,etc were his work and not the script.I liked his way of dressing and how quick he would switch between moods and ironically how he hated violence. CGI:Looked very good sometimes like Hela vs Surtur scene,Hela vs the Valkyrior,Thor vs Hulk,everyone vs the army of the dead but the scene they changed,where Hela emerged from her prison was bad in terms of effects,they filmed a new sequence and then added the old,alley one reaction when she caught the hammer. Soundtrack:It was formidable,especially the Immigrant song added to the biggest action pieces throughout the movie. Landscapes:I was beyond happy with what we got,Skar,Asgard,ruins of the old cemetery below the Throne room,the secret fortress,Hell,Hela's prison,Norway,Sanctum Sanctorum and of course New York. Personal observations:1)Hela as a mix of characters I felt ended up doing more bad for her than good,her comic self is so much superior to this mixed bag they did,it ended up being good thanks to Blanchett's acting.I was so disappointing we got no throne in Niffelheim but a cheap prison set up by her father,powered by his life force. 2)The Asgard scenes while more meaningful than Skar were too short,very insightful but short. 3)Taika's directing was wrong for this movie,the comedy was good but it needed more seriousness,more cosmic action,more Ragnarok and less improvisation,because not everyone is Goldblum or Blanchett to rock at these things.4)I sure Hope Hela takes over Death's role in MCU and we will get her back,she deserves this,both her and Cate unless they want to waste another Oscar actress..."
25 October 2017,zerone23,51,89,8,Exciting light-humored movie,"Here it is, our God of Thunder is back after AoU.As many reviews said that this movie is light-humored movie, I can confirm that's true. However, for me, it didn't reduce much essence of the theme. It's well delivered. Other than this, I do very like the visualization and cinematographic, especially on bifrost fight. It beats GoTG for sure.Okay, the characters. FFS, Hela is OP. Thor didn't have any chance against her. She is unstoppable and cannot f-word die. She is goddess of death, after all. Maybe I can put her in the third position of strongest villain on MCU below big-purple man and Surtur. I didn't list Dormammu because we have not see his true strength.So, conclusion. Nearly cry tears for joy by seeing the original power of Thor, Valkyrie is awesome, Loki is still God of Mischief, Heimdall didn't have Soul Stone neither nor Hela, there is a character who totally change in Infinity War later, and we get a tiny glimpse on how Thor get stranded in Star Lord's ship in first post end credit scene.It's a 8.0 of 10"
3 November 2017,pc95,11,20,6,Over-Parody of Itself,"Its gotten to the point where superhero franchises are trying to re- invent themselves with each iteration, and ""Thor:Ragnarok"" is a case in point. Directed by Taika Waititi to the excesses and extremes of goofiness, ""Thor Ragnarok"" doubles down on the sitcomish fluff of its 2nd middle sibling big brother movie ""Thor Dark World"". The movie actually suffers on a binge of humor, certainly an over-parody of its excellent origin installment. Some of the humor works and some of it wears thin, especially the sarcasm. The effects are gorgeous to behold, but there is, like other recent Marevel sequels, an amp-up in humor at a cost in gravitas and weight of story. Its no easy task to find the balance or happy medium for directors and Waititi turns on the proverbial fire-hose to the point where the rest of the story feels perfunctory. One last thing, there is no place for Willy Wonka or Led Zepplin riffs as messy overlaps in tone and poor choices for music. 6/10 mixed"
27 October 2017,dave_maguire,49,87,5,My head is Thor,"I went in to this film maybe a little too expectant, I love Marvel, love the Thor comic character, and love the way Chris Hemsworth portrays him on the screen. However, this film is COMPLETELY different to every other portrayal of Thor and it doesn't work. Thor's comedy has generally stemmed from his failure to integrate with humans on earth, when he was on Asgard he was this regal, well versed, humble, albeit slightly cocky character, yet from his first scene you can tell the film is taking a completely different route with him. And this is where the main problem of the film lies. For a film called ""Ragnarok"", which is basically about the death & destruction of Asgard, there is too much of a light tone throughout this film and WAY TOO much ""comic"" dialogue - I put that in speech marks as a lot of the one liners do not work and fall flat, and this is purely because of the sheer volume of them in the film. Comedy only works when there is a straight man to work off, yet nearly every character in the film is written the same and thus loses their individuality. This is such a shame as it causes the film to lose all impact on the sad or serious moments. Within the first 30 minutes Thor discovers the Loki is posing as Odin and, instead of being A: amazed he's still alive, and B: He's somehow banished his all powerful father, he simply laughs this off as a little joke Loki has played, then when they find Odin and he subsequently ""dies"" just before they meet Hela, who then goes on to destroy Mjolnir, there is no mourning period and before you know it we're on Sakaar being treated to no end of electrocution jokes.(Though isn't Thor the god of Thunder and can summon lightning?? Why would he be incapacitated by an electric shock?)It's such a shame that, as Thor has just lost 2 of the most important things to him, this isn't given time to sink in or be dealt with and is just glazed over with a quick childish argument with the Hulk.It's not all bad though, I found once on Sakaar the film picked up somewhat. The Hulk/Thor fight doesn't disappoint, and there were a couple of nice character additions here, the Grandmaster was better than I thought he would be and wasn't too ""Goldblum"", Korg is probably the funniest part of this film and his comic lines do work well, I would like to see him return again. Hulk is fleshed out a bit more as well and we continue to see the internal struggle between him and Banner during the film. Another addition is Skurge who, the less said about him, the better..! Pointless, waste of time being in the film. Valkyrie is a strange character, I know she was completely changed from the comic books, but I don't think that the character is particularly well developed and thus I wasn't really invested in her at all during the movie. I also think the part quite easily could have been portrayed by Lady Sif, (who is strangely absent in the film despite the warriors 3 appearing??) And would have had more impact in the plot than the reasoning behind Valkyrie's self imposed exile. But the main plus point from the film, which is music to Marvel fan's ears, is Hela is a success as a villain, it has been a long time since we've had a villain to rival Loki (who FYI is wasted in the film and is getting a bit annoying now) but Hela is great, we got some development in to her character, albeit a little small, but I very much look forward to her appearing in Infinity War so we can hopefully develop her further.So whilst it's not the best Marvel film, it's certainly not the worst by a long shot. I did enjoy it, it was just the constant barrage of jokes wore very thin very quickly and definitely detracted from the overall story. But with all this said, my non fan boy friend loved the film....!"
21 November 2017,Horst_In_Translation,16,34,6,"Some glaring weaknesses, but still pointless fun as a whole","""Thor: Ragnarok"" is the newest superhero movie from the Marvel universe and it is the third one starring Thor (not counting the Avengers films). It runs for easily over 2 hours and marks the arrival at Hollywood filmmaking for director Taiki Waititi (NZL), who is also a prolific actor himself and voice acts in here too. Apart from Chris Hemsworth, there are several other familiar faces in here like Hopkins, Hiddleston, Ruffalo, Elba and Cumberbatch reprising their roles while new additions like Blanchett, Goldblum, Thompson and Urban add their share too, sometimes for the good, at other times not so much. I'll get to that in detail soon. First of all, it needs to be said that this was certainly a solid watch. It is a film that will entertain you well if you want it to. However, the moment you take an in-depth look at it, you will find flaws, flaws that are frequent and flaws that are crucial. One example would be Tessa Thompson's character and performance which was extremely underwhelming as honestly there was nothing remotely interesting about her in here that justified her being built up as a love interest to Thor. Sure seems like they are really struggling with regard to those. At least Portman gets a mention. Blanchett made a pretty good villain to be honest thanks to costume mostly, but also thanks to the actress being almost too good for the part. Sadly her connection with Urban's character never really gains steam, her character feels like the exact opposite of somebody who would get herself an executioner and so the final twist in this relationship stays really underwhelming. Same can be said about the death of Hopkins' character that had zero emotional impact on me unfortunately.The worst part of the film is probably the one in almost the entire second half of the movie where they are trying to make a reference to the refugee crisis. The intention is okay, even if the film really didn't need it, but the execution is extremely shoddy as these poor people running around in their torn clothes added absolutely nothing for me. The consequence is that an actor I appreciate a lot and think he is very talented, namely Idris Elba, was wasted completely in this film. Such a shame. And then there is the comedy of course. I think it needs a little while to become really funny at times as the jokes in the first hour or so are mostly try-hard sadly, but afterward there are more than just a few inclusions and I would say the writers did a decent job overall in that department. As for the characters, there is Banner's fear of not being able to turn back into his human form if he becomes Hulk again. And I thought that is really the best that could happen as Hulk is so much more interesting and funny than Ruffalo's performance. The talk about him being a bigger fire was pure comedy gold and it was one of these moments when ""ego comedy"" fully delivers, certainly much funnier than when it comes from Iron Man. I also quite liked the rock guy. I think he was the one voiced by Waititi. Almost all characters have some very funny moments, so comedy may actually be the area where the film delivered the best, even if there are moments too when it goes very wrong (""anus to hell"").But there are other departments too of course that make it an enjoyable watch. This film is really on a high level technically including sound, visual effects, but also sets etc. Definitely worth watching if these are the most important fields for you. And the bad guys make it worth seeing too, like Goldblum's absurd turn and Blanchett's scary turn, even if it is tough to believe she would be on par with Thor in the last fight with how she's been crushing all film long. Another thing I like here is that it is a brave film. A lot of stuff happens in these two hours that can't be taken back, the death of Odin, the destruction of Thor's hammer, the end of Asgard where it once was, the loss of Thor's eye etc. and that's pretty bold as they are not just going back to the situation as it was before the film. Okay completely on a side-note now, but where were the Avengers when Hulk ended up on that planet and was unable to turn into his human version? Aren't they supposed to help him as they are his friends. Oh well, on a more personal note, I still find it difficult to accept Loki as a helper in here which he was for the most part given how many times he has been a primary antagonist in these new Marvel superhero films. I think that is all I want to say for now about this film, it has its weak moments and its great moments, but most of the time the quality is somewhere in-between. I don't think I have to give you a recommendation here as I am sure you have seen enough other Marvel/Thor stuff to make up your mind for yourself. I personally give it a thumbs-up though, even if I would say it is slightly inferior to the very first Thor movie."
26 October 2017,rosaliesummers,67,124,9,Thor strikes again,"Thor has never been my favourite avenger. Although I quite enjoyed his first movie, I hated the second one, and didn't quite know what to expect with this one. However, I absolutely loved it! In the opening scene the humour felt a bit awkward but it quickly gets better throughout, and had the whole cinema of people laughing. I've seen several people compare it to Guardians Of The Galaxy which I think is quite accurate.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) was brilliant in this movie. He suited the humour really well and played it up quite a bit. It also wouldn't be a Thor film if we didn't have a shirtless scene at some point, and who's complaining to be honest. In my opinion the character was a lot better without the annoying love interest of Jane, who for me personally brought absolutely nothing to the first two movies. She is conveniently tied off when some random human mentions that she dumped Thor, and that's all we hear about her at all. I think the Valkyrie is supposed to be the new love interest, and she shared one or two little moments with Thor throughout the film which was nice. She's a drunk, feisty Asgardian and at least she has more personality than Jane. Just saying, sorry to any Jane fans out there. The dynamic between Thor and Hulk was pretty fun too and he was a welcome addition to the film.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is amazing as always. I'm a bit of a Loki fangirl to be honest so I'm slightly biased, but he was funny as ever. We still don't really know what he's doing, as at some points he tries to save Thor and the next he betrays him again, which is kind of annoying. The thing that still hasn't been explained from the first movie though is if he is a frost giant why does he have godly powers? I don't understand! Anyway at the end there are some brotherly bonding moments, and all seems pretty good between them. For now.The absolute best new character was Korg. A lot of the best jokes came from him and I hope we see more of this character at some point. Hela was also quite a good villain, she had a straightforward aim and plan, which makes a change from Loki's confusing plots. Kinda feel a little sorry for her but not really.Let's talk a little about the plot. Thor wants to prevent Ragnarok, which you probably know as basically the doomsday of Norse mythology. Whilst on Midgard discussing it with Odin, Odin passes away, meaning Thor's evil sister is released from wherever Odin's magic was containing her. The thing that seemed a little strange to me as that nobody knew who Hela was? She was around when Odin was conquering the nine realms, so do no Asgardians remember that? I'm also not sure about the whole evil sister thing, we kind of already had that with Loki but oh well. Also if Hela is literally the goddess of death why can't she just kill everyone with a click of her fingers if she's so 'super powerful' and everything, like how Thor can summon lightening. Oh well.As usual with Marvel films, great songs, cinematography and special effects. Fight scenes were good, plenty of badass moments.Honestly this is the best Thor film, go watch it. It's a good laugh and great action and you won't be disappointed."
1 May 2021,jessienovakromanova,8,11,9,This is why I love Taika Waititi,"I never even heard about Taika before this movie happened, but as soon as I finished watching it, he literally became one of my favorite directors of all time. This movie is your go to if you need a feel good movie that makes you laugh. I literally can't choose which one is the best and most funny scene, but all of it it's amazing, Stepehn Strange cameo, Loki as a whole, Thor and Bruce, I loved it all, I specially loved how even though it's mostly comedy it tackles serious issues like PTSD, depression, alcholism or the whole arc of Bruce, which I enjoyed so much considering how little anyone on AoU was written to care about Bruce's wishes. It was genuinly so amazing and so funny considering, if you actually think about it, has a really dark and sad plot considering Asgard got stinguished forever, but as Thor said ""Asgard it's its people"" so I'm hopeful. I'd like to mention THOR not needing the hammer and fighting the bad guys alone with lighting and stuff while LE ZEPPELIN's INMIGRANT SONG plays was one of the most iconic scenes on the whole MCU in my opinion.Not gonna lie, I hate we didn't get a canon scene of Valkyrie being bisexual, as it is stablished she is (Tessa and Taika confirmed it), but I'm happy we'll get it on the next movie. Overall amazing casting, amazing writting and directing, amazing comedy, all of it was amazing."
7 November 2017,pyrocitor,9,16,7,"""This joke I like it! ANOTHER!""","Those of us with the unmitigated gall to still love Marvel Studios movies bear a perennial cross: everyone else bemoaning their superhero ennui. How they've had enough of self-important, solemn, formulaic superhero films, with their aimless CGI- drenched climaxes, paint-by-numbers villains, and clumsy scaffolding to sell tickets to future movies. ""All fair,"" I respond, as we wait to pre-order our Black Panther tickets. Still, you know what they say about squeaky wheels - Disney execs listen to them, apparently. And lo, there was balance in the Force er Thor-ce? And Ragnarok is its puzzling Skywalker. On one hand, its unfettered comedic whimsy and synth-soaked Flash Gordon pastiche feel like a profound victory for the forces of fun. And yet, there's something perennially off - an indulgence in its kookiness that goes beyond cheeky and strays perilously close to contemptuous at times. Granted, it's perversely appropriate that a blockbuster titled after the apocalyptic eradication of Asgard and the Gods work to dismantle the established tone and mythos of Thor so gleefully. Still, as giddily enjoyable as this apocalypse is, there's still an inescapable sense of the baby being thrown out with the Asgardian bathwater. Thor - a literal 'super-god' - has always been tough to sell. Even Kenneth Branagh, hired for his Shakespearian credentials, subjected ol' Goldilocks to slapstick and punchlines galore (and a meowing Kat Dennings) in his first cinematic outing to keep him accessible. In this regard, the quirky, charming Taika Waititi is an unorthodox but inspired directorial choice, and he musters up more colour, zippiness, and breezy humour that Thor's previous four appearances combined. No gag, be it witty or scatological, is too small for Waititi, and it's rare for his leads to go more than a few minutes without being subjected to some kind of amusing physical comedy indignation (Hiddleston's Loki, of all people, steals the film's biggest laugh and pratfall in one fell swoop). And, varying degrees of silliness or not, the film is uproariously funny from opening to closing shot. What doesn't work as well is the film's comparative lack of consequence otherwise. Well-deserved zany tonal shift or not, Ragnarok is, literally, about the end of the world. And, although proceedings need not be as dark as, er, The Dark World, it is fairly disconcerting-nigh-disrespectful to have a film involving genocide, slavery, the inglorious death of the entirety of Thor's family(!!!), subplots unpacking Asgardian war-crimes and refugees (intriguing but under-explored), and, y'know, the whole end of days thing, be treated with such glib indifference by Waititi's customary impassive deadpan. Characters factually state that they are upset about their tribulations, but it seldom resonates, as Waititi, uncharacteristically, deprives them of the gently emotional character check-ins that elevate his more strictly comedic fare - Viago the vampire pining like a puppy at the window of his aging crush; Ricky Baker's crude, pyromaniac haiku betraying a lifetime of loneliness. Similarly, the film's editing is almost teasingly clumsy, careening between locations and disparate plot points (including a Benedict Cumberbatch cameo as riotously enjoyable as it is transparently superfluous) with a smirking nonchalance. If Waititi's intent was to have his cake and eat it too - taking the p*ss out of Thor while still delivering a straightforward Thor romp - he heartily delivers on the former, but too often at the behest of the latter. Still, as the Grandmaster might chortle, you can debate academic semantics all day, but we all know why we're really here. And, in terms of exhilarating spectacle, Waititi kicks it out of the gladiatorial arena. From fire demons and subterranean dragons, to the impressively nuanced emotions of a certain jolly green giant, Ragnarok boasts some of the most exceptionally realized visual effects in a Marvel film, and Waititi draws a clever contrast between the pristine, techno- mythology panoramas of Asgard (which we finally see, beyond throne room and rainbow bridge!), and the junky, Jack Kirby cubism of Sakaar. Similarly, the film's combat, both in and out of the arena, is fast, furious, and engrossing, with operatically surreal touches - including a showdown between Hela's rippling waves of knives, spaceship lasers, a giant wolf, and two machine guns - keeping proceedings fun and fresh.Chris Hemsworth has proved himself more than reliably adept at flexing comedic muscles in tandem with biceps. Nonetheless, this Thor is a few too many ""Bros"" and mugging punchlines away from his past self to fully invest in to the extent we know we can and should. Tom Hiddleston, conversely, continues to find new, compelling wrinkles in Loki - both comedic, as a begrudging whipping boy, and in quiet, crestfallen, recognition of his perennial self-sabotaging his secret aspirations of heroism. Mark Ruffalo is pristinely deadpan without overstaying his welcome, while playing his warring Hulk/Banner character beats of indignant, cavernous loneliness for all their worth. Cate Blanchett preens with masterful predatory menace, but feels almost criminally wasted as yet another frustratingly underdeveloped Marvel foe. Thankfully, Tessa Thompson is coolness personified as the grimly alcoholic Valkyrie, even if Karl Urban's Skurge feels a touch too goofy and hangdog, given his ferocious comic referent. That said, if Ragnarok unleashes one abiding gift unto the world, it's the most unapologetically unhinged Jeff Goldblum since he first growled like a dinosaur back in '93. Every microsecond of Grandmaster weirdness is a rainbow rose of enigmatic wisdom. Thor: Ragnarok stands as a curious, slight overcompensation from a company fighting to appease a virtually built-in audience. Still, as a comedy first, superhero film second, it's an uproariously entertaining ride, albeit one that may leave comic purists wishing Waititi could have dialled down the silly or dialled up the emotion 20% for optimum Odinson. Still, as ThorFour may never grace cinemas, it's sufficient to crank the Led Zeppelin, and ride into the intergalactic sunset with him getting to enjoy himself for once. Excessively nitpicking a swan song so well-deserved would be ""just ugh the worst."" -7.5/10"
27 July 2021,anselmdaniel,10,18,7,Fun adventure,"This review contains spoilers.Thor: Ragnarok is the third movie in the Thor movie series. The movie stars Thor the god of Thunder as he seeks to stop Ragnarok. Hel, played by Cate Blanchett, rises and seeks to dominate Asgard.Thor: Ragnarok is first and foremost a fun adventure. All the scenes in this movie have bright and vibrant colors. The dialogue in this movie is also meant to be light-hearted and funny. Thor has become a more funny character in his dead-pan delivery than in his previous movies. Anyone that has seen Guardians of the Galaxy will be familiar with the color palette and tone of this movie. The humor is similar. This tone also shifts Thor's character. If audience's liked Thor's stoicism, it is not as prevalent here. It seemed as if the writers wanted to course correct Thor to be more likable.The story is similar to a mini-Avengers movie. Thor assembles his team to stop Hel. This leads him to a multi-world adventure where he recruits Loki, Hulk, and Valkyrie. In addition he also leads a prison revolt. The story is nothing new to the Marvel cinematic universe. Aspects of this story has already been present in other movies. The differences here are its setting and characters. The beloved Thor characters are here and audience swill like seeing them. The characters and events did become predictable. The audience only need to imagine the silliest result and it will happen. This is the story's weak point as it felt as if the characters all shared the same traits. It felt as if the movie was written quickly as scenes seem to end with no consequence.Cate Blanchett and Chris Hemsworth are the main highlights here. Cate does a good job as Hela and scenes with her are enjoyable. Hela is still a normal Marvel villain but her dialogue is more enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth dealt with his character's changes well and he is a more funny character here. Tom Hiddleston is a classic as Loki. The greatest surprise is Jeff Goldblum as the grand-master. His line delivery is perfect as he portrays an oppressive but fun master of a world.Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is recommended. It is a movie that is a fun adventure, however it does not do anything different from the Marvel formula.Grade: B."

5 November 2017,a-r-notifications,185,376,1,Thor Ragnarok... Truly Ragnarok in all the sense of the word.,Whilst the movie was enjoyable I wasn't expecting a comedy. it is a slapstick comedy from Marvel or something that was created for school children. I know that you have to sell a product that doesn't mean you make an action movie or a hero movie Or a superhero movie do a total slapstick comedy full of puns and one-liners making me think I'm watching a 90s superhero movie with 2017 digital effects if you wanted to characterize this as a comedy and then probably I would have given in the higher score but since it was in my word superhero movies it deserves the lowest score that can be given the director was great but if this was meant to be a comedy nothing new or groundbreaking does not even compare to anything good only reason it is getting good reviews is because the rest of the movies in the box office are below par or not superhero movies. Expected a lot but was severely disappointed. Slot of missed opportunities.
6 February 2018,audacity10,61,118,1,What did I just watch?!,"We've clearly hit an era in Hollywood where critics are totally at odds with the general public -and with good taste- with regards to latest blockbusters.From the opening scene, I could tell the comedic tone and the addition of swear-words was a result of Deadpool's success, but unlike Deadpool, the ""humour"" on display here felt more like an insult directed at the viewer. The horrendous art-style, lifted straight out of 1980's Flash Gordon, was also a slap in the face to the viewer. It's like the director was quite openly laughing at how bad he could make this look and still get away with it because it was super-camp.Then we had the usual feminist incursions, with the lead female villain literally crushing Thor's hammer in her hand (only a hand-full of characters can actually lift the hammer, never mind pulverising it!). And we have a female side-character apparently so strong and cool that Thor is humiliated and made to look puny on a regular basis by her. She's also infinitely stronger than the Hulk who at one point gets knocked to the floor by her... then symbolically stepped on then walked over!I could go on, but this movie already robbed me of 2hrs, so I'll simply finish by saying this is right up there with the very worst movies I've ever seen. This is what happens when communism creeps into entertainment."

9 February 2018,vdmakwana,181,362,6,This wasn't a Thor movie at all!,"May be this is mostly targeted for children to teenage aged audiences. Humorous, colorful, C.G.I packed, with retro soundtracks. Making a comedy movie formula has worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool already, that doesn't mean that it has to be imposed in Thor too.Not bad if you have cheap tickets, but don't pay extra for IMAX/3D experience (we watched in 3D).**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD**Hulk's (and of course Dr. Strange's) character is somewhat forced into the film. Even his CGI looks cheap too.Odin, why bother casting him in the first place? The all-father, one of the most powerful characters of Thor franchise looks tired and bored to continue with the series.Valkyrie, is she supposed to be a musclebound warrior or some glamorous cat-walking (cheap) cosplaying model?Karl Urban, ""Executioner"" again. Great choice but poorly portrayed. You once played Judge Dredd Karl, remember that?If it was supposed to be an (officially) funny movie, Korg was the best!!!"
1 July 2021,morrison-dylan-fan,10,21,10,Thor: Issue 3.,"Recently having seen the great animated Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (2010 Video-also reviewed) I felt it was time to open the pages on a ""New"" MCU title I had missed seeing, which led to me opening the plastic sleeve and getting out the third volume of Thor.View on the film:Smashing down the dour colours of Thor: The Dark World (2013-also reviewed) co-star/ director Taika Waititi & Goosebumps (2015-also reviewed) cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe charge up an explosive cosmic atmosphere of sparkling neon primary colours dripping across the screen, with superb CGI linking the expressive face of the Hulk to Bruce Banner,and sprawling wide-shots by Waititi hovering over the destruction of Asgard.Throwing Hulk and Thor into the Contest of Champions, Waititi hits them both with stylised rapid-fire whip-pans that follow each punch in the exciting Action set-pieces landing with a thump,which Waititi pulls back for close-ups on one-line quips,before a brutal one-punch knock out is delivered.On their own without any of the other Avengers in the Contest of Champions, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo make a brilliant double act as Thor and Hulk, with Hemsworth balancing the seriousness Thor views the dire state of Asgard, with a dead-pan comedic edge from how important Thor treats everything he says.Spending over half the film in CGI, Ruffalo gets under the roar of Hulk to reveal the fear, anxiety and mistrust Banner has for Thor,and of his own ability to control his inner monster,whilst Cate Blanchett delivers her cackling dialogue as Hela with relish, and Jeff Goldblum lights up the flick,as the lounge lizard Grandmaster.Whilst clearly inspired in the gladiator contest by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan's terrific Planet Hulk,the screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Craig Kyle and Eric Pearson display a thoughtfulness in the heroism of Thor,by using his belief in Asgard, to study the colonialism used by Asgard to grab it's riches and powers.Chipping away at the history Thor's dad Odin has tried to paint his blood-drench brutality over with, the writers wonderfully having Hela, (whose images have been whitewashed/painted over in the palace) display that her desire for destruction has not faded since she was locked away,leading Thor to take to heart protecting his fellow citizens of Asgard,not the wealth Asgard was built on from colonialism, and leaving the land behind as a refugee with his fellow Asgardians for a new home."
23 December 2021,damarahernandez,4,4,9,Funny but needed more drama,"I had a lot of fun with this movie, however I think it should have had more drama to take the movie more seriously.I loved the development of Loki and Thor's sibling relationship and I loved the character of Valkyrie.I did not like the treatment towards Hela, I think you could expect much more from this villain, as I said, a little less jokes and more drama."
2 November 2017,TheFearmakers,7,13,4,Marvel or The Marx Brothers?,"The latest THOR is spontaneous and freewheeling, especially while on a planet straight out of the famous Roman Gladiator arena where, as the trailers spoiled long ago, the anticipated fight between two seemingly indestructible AVENGERS, Thor and Hulk, takes place. Which leads to one of the film's best devices...Thor, without his hammer, is nearly as vulnerable as a mortal human albeit a very strong one up against an assortment of odds, making for a non-stop planet-to-planet roller-coaster ride...Visually a hybrid of the intentionally campy 1980's FLASH GORDON and the first GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY while shadowing plot-elements of STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS and with more sleek, colorful rainbows than we've yet seen on Asgard — which has been taken over by a deadly, invincible sister (looking like Maleficent dressed as a reindeer) that Thor and the mischievous Loki never knew they had — there's a cool retro-techno score to back up the pulsating arcade of explosive action.And while it's understandable that, with such a fantastical superhero, levity is needed to ground the audience, there's a fine line between Fun and Funny, and RAGNAROK, featuring sarcasm-guru Jeff Goldblum embarrassingly overdosing on his own style — breaks it once too often: Superheroes all have powers and/or skills that can, whether built-in or created, turn on and off. But the constantly witty, wry one-liner styling of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark (inventor of 'Starkcasm') has infected Chris Hemsworth's THOR to the point that his third solo film, while enjoyable enough, nearly drowns itself in self-deprecating parody.

It has high quality action, great comedy and a very very good story line for once. Unlike be other Thor movies which were pretty poor, this one is absolutely fantastic! I cannot praise this movie enough! I was in stitches for most of the film, as was the rest of the cinema audience. The character 'Korg' is a sensationally funny character and one to look out for; those one liners are amazing. Truly a great movie with excellent content, and overshadows both previous movies. I'd you don't see this movie, you will really be missing out! Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much content the Hulk had. He wasn't just a side character for this movie which I expected"
8 November 2017,darioilg,10,17,9,Hiddleston/Hemsworth fun-pack,"What ""Thor: Ragnarok"" explicitly states is a doomsday catastrophe going on; what it really does is reinvigorate a dying cinematic hero with the power of comedy. Who would've known that the Thor universe could have so much comedic effect in the right hands, and that it would be the right direction for such a traditionally serious character. So that is the good aspect of this new Thor, which also happens to be the best of the three; the bad is that, unfortunately, even the creative Taika Waititi can't upset the tired Marvel formula of filling too many scenes with mindless action. It's not like action scenes are bad per se, as they are perfectly rendered in other recent MCU films like ""Homecoming"" or ""Civil War"": they just don't fit in this story as they would elsewhere because they ruin the flow of the story. The story itself is nothing special: just a series of bad guys to give Thor someone to punch or characters from other Marvel brands to team up with. Some of said team-ups are really cool and/or unexpected, and yes, my man Stan Lee has a funny cameo in this one as well. As most people know, the main side-kick of Thor's in this one is the Incredible Hulk. Although they may not be the most sympathetic of characters in the Marvel Universe, it's undeniable that Waititi does a good job of making them fun, at least until they are bound to save Asgard in the customary final big fight. The main villain is a new entry in the MCU: Thor's sister Hela, the goddess of Death, played by a slick Cate Blanchett with a less slick headgear. Her character starts strong, but as the film goes on her personality gets flattened and it's ultimately relieving to see her go to Hel. It is very clear that Disney knows how well received her Star Wars characters have been and it's trying to reformulate them in this Norse context. One can clearly see Han Solo's disinterest, confidence and ultimately reformation in the amazing Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, or Jabba the Hut's careless cruelty in Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster; both actors did incredible jobs on this one, by the way. If it seems that this whole mess may be any fun, yes it is indeed, and its icing on the cake is the fantastic Korg, voiced by Waititi himself, and, even with his limited screen time, one of the best additions to the show. But again, it's the action pieces that really show how handcuffed the author is here, not being able to completely liberate his comedic genius by force of contractual restraints. I would've liked a completely different Marvel movie, but I know it's kind of a non-possibility. Nevertheless, he's able to save the movie with his outstanding witty dialogues, from which the first beneficiary is Chris Hemsworth, proving himself a better comic than he is a dramatic actor. His timing and delivery are simply perfect and it shows from the get go, when our hero is chained from the wall of Surtur's cave. Those chains he frees himself from are the token of him getting rid of his upright persona and finally able to behave the way he does best: having fun. And it only gets better as the next scene is one of the most hilarious in the whole movie: Thor realizing that Odin is actually his brother Loki while watching a Shakespeare-like play of his heroic death in battle. Loki himself, as expected, plays a core part in the film, and he has as effective comedic pieces as everyone else. ""Thor Ragnarok"" really works under many aspects: for a change we get a memorable soundtrack, also graced by ""Immigrant Song"", that really works in the context it's put in. It's a shame that the MCU format demands mindless, useless action at all costs, because outside that downgrade, this could've been the comedy of the year. 7.5/10"
30 October 2017,alva3901,46,90,9,Marvel's most audacious film to date.... and it pays off,"Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-""that's what heroes do"". The ""Revengers"" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), ""his friend from work"", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun."

Busting to go to the loo (far too much Diet Coke)! but didn't want to miss a minute of this cracker of sparky and sparkly joyous romp. There was so much to laugh about in the car home, from the bromance between Hulk and Thor, the wonderful scene steeling Korg, (see ya new Doug!) Jeff Goldblum hamming it up as only he can through to the battle scenes using Led Zeps Immigrants Song and Tom Hiddlestones Loki's comedic facial grimaces. When a movie is talked about in the car home with my family, it's a sign we all enjoyed this, big time! Lasted until the end then - ahhhh the relief!! Two after credits scenes, one fairly important to the next movies in the MCU, the other just funny!"
27 October 2017,SamwiseG,28,58,5,Am I Missing Something???,"Having read the majority of other reviews on here I really have to wonder if I was missing something. Personally I found this movie rather tedious and uninspiring, with its conspicuous use of Antipodean actors and even more conspicuous use of corny attempts at comedy. Add to that an unconvincing performance from Cate Blanchett as the 'baddie' and the movie face plants itself straight into the Asgard dirt. Maybe I'm wrong, but to me it really was quite a disappointment and I am so glad that I had saved myself the additional expense of the IMAX 3D viewing."
1 November 2017,slainye-1,52,96,10,"Expected good, got Great!","I thoroughly enjoyed this film- credit must go to the fantastic humour, excellent direction and art direction- a great example of translating comic art into film, and finally, the stunning Cate Blanchett who stole the show over other highly commendable performances. The cast overall is perfectly assembled, especially the new Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie!Kudos to Taika Waititi for helming a project this size and delivering an example of how to do it right."
8 November 2017,Dragonsouls,10,19,8,It's a comedy! And I'm not complaining,"My analysis of Thor Ragnarok. (spoilers)The recent installation of Thor was a bit more lighthearted than the previous films, which had more of a serious tone to them. Normally I would complain but I got a few laughs and there was enough substance to the plot, especially the part about Norse mythology.In the film, Odin tells Thor that the time of the Gods are over. And that their reign was largely based on a sham, and that their religion was made up, in order to cover up darker truths about their history....which includes the covering up of Ragnarok, who is just a renamed devil in this movie, complete with horns and fiery breath.Without giving too much away, the coming of Ragnarok is a Norse prophecy of apocalypse. Ragnarok's return led to the freeing of Hela, Thor's sister and daughter of Odin, breaks free from her prison with an army of undead. Yes, there's zombies in a Thor film now! But I'm not complaining. This awakening force of nature will eventually lead to the destruction of Asguard.When Thor realizes that he, and the Hulk and a few other of his friends are powerless to stop Ragnarok from happening, he comes to realize that it was never meant to be stopped...and you can't stop prophecies. The plot isn't the most intricate or dramatic, but the strength of this film comes from the interchange between the cast, who are beaming with charisma. Even the Hulk is charming in this film...yes, that's right, a charming, funny Hulk. Last but not least; the soundtrack was brilliant. It reminded me of Tron Legacy, in that this film felt like a Synthwave musical."

Lets tippy toe around the audience, god knows how fragile they are and how they will not be able to handle any kind of emotions.
pauses? Silence? No that is not what we do here, if we don't get some meaningless line in there at every 2 seconds people will think there is a technical error and the sound has a problem.Disgraceful is the word here and you people wonder why despite the ""critical acclaim"" none of these movies ever get anything as in the form of industry recognition.
I am running the risk of becoming a bitter person here Disney, seriously, what is up with you?
It is as if Disney is not the same company that made Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King etc
People are not fragile or mindless to begin with but when you constantly feed them these mind-numbing sewage waste they will eventually become that.Freaking Shakespeare knew this 5 centuries ago. and I quote:
""And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.""This is just sad, I don't hate on these films or Disney or Marvel.
I weep for the fate that has befallen these characters."

30 October 2017,namob-43673,17,39,1,"Blackwashing, too many jokes, but very funny okayish movie","Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative, the acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still do not like it... Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something. The reason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get rid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a planet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the blackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick comedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like they've almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I do not like it at all. This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood, the dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is not a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it... Also there are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in the movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on. I still give this movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the fact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the racism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does not spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise..."
20 November 2019,Marynewcomb2013,11,23,1,Worst of the Thors,"I'm not a Disney lover by no means!!! They did do some marvel movies that were good like the first two Thor's, but this one shows what all of us who see Disney for the ruiners they are!!! This was a fast cash grab for the avengers movie & NOT a stand alone movie!! It's a crossover like the last two Caption America's, last two Iron Man's, the new spider man movies!!!
This has some laughs when it's not supposed to be a comedy but fails as a super hero movie in every way!!! Thor is the god of thunder but for most of the movie, they make him look week!! A small disc gets planted on his neck & is used to control him!! A god is not controlable people!!! His hammer gets destroyed by his sister, (the hammer is indestructible)!!! He gets dropped basically, on a junk planet with Jeff G. as ruler!! Hulk has been there for two years & never changes back until he sees an archive clip of Black Widow!!! It's a pathetic attempt at a comic movie!!! These types of movies must be stopped before they get ruined for good!!"
8 November 2017,eparazak,11,21,9,It's one heck of an adventure!,"Thor: Ragnarok is the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that puts Thor in the spotlight for the third time. This movie is about the rerise of Hela, Thor and Loki's lost sister who rises after being imprisoned for years by their father Odin as she looks to destroy Asgard. While being sent to an unknown world by her, the brothers discover the whereabouts of the Hulk.When I first saw the trailer for this movie I wanted to be realistic with what the final product could have been. I originally thought this movie was going to be just average like the two previous Thor films. Going in, I was wrong. This movie essentially answers many different questions in the span of two hours. Such questions include how Thor would be able to fight if he didn't have his hammer and the aforementioned whereabouts of the Hulk. Speaking of which, the Hulk feels like he has a more of a personality compared to how he usually is. In the other Marvel films that I've seen him, he only really stuck out as a one note character who did nothing but get angry. In this film, he feels like more of a character and this is shown with the heart-to-heart conversation between him and Thor. The movie was also very well shot in terms of the cinematography and the fight scenes. The jokes, while there may be a few too many, really worked and I laughed at virtually all of them. Again, I did feel like the humor overstayed its welcome and was overwhelming at times, which is a little distracting, which brings the movie slightly down for me. Either way, I enjoyed the experience of watching Ragnarok a lot and I am really looking forward to Infinity War coming within the next five months.9/10"

31 October 2017,elboertjie,37,69,2,Slap-stick comedy riddled with silly jokes,"This film was destroyed for me by the non-stop silly so-called jokes through the entire film. From the opening scene to the last scene, there is hardly a 20 second time period without some silly jokes and they really get stuck on them.Why oh why do they have to ruin a film like this with endless silly saying and stupid things? Where are the serious and more somber moments in this superhero film where they have to do dangerous life- threatening things to rescue the world? All serious scenes were plastered with silly things they said.Spoiler part here: The only serious scenes were the ones where Thor talked to his real dad.The Hulk was talking too much and said really silly things and that 'stone-man' fighter with the high-pitched voice was ridiculous.I was looking forward to this movie and the trailer made it look really powerful and serious, but it was a film about clowns with capes."
26 October 2017,latheal-351-133904,68,137,4,"It's Ragnarok, not a day out at Disney World, Marvel.","If you like your comicbook superhero films full of one-liners, nonsensical plotting, drastic character changes, underdeveloped villains, missing important characters (for no other reason other than they were probably unavailable) then Thor 3 is right up your street. For me, its another wasted opportunity. For the record, I loved Thor 1, disliked Thor 2 and Thor 3 is perhaps a slightly better film than the second one, but I'm rating it lower because it had the opportunity to be so much more than what it was. Ragnarok should not be a comedy buddy film. The consistent comedy played throughout this film (which is literally from the first scene until the last) just feels so out of place in a film that has what should be an epic and profound story. In the context of the film, it removes any semblance of doom, or indeed care to the main characters - if they are able to laugh and joke about the situation, why the hell should you as a viewer care? This comedic attitude spoils what could have been an epic story line. Right from Thor uncovering Loki's deception (and his reaction to that most heinous crime which is somewhat unbelievable) to Kiwi Gladiators constantly cracking jokes in the arena which should be a life or death situation (and in turn, reducing the middle act to a ponderous, overtly long section that is only there to bring Hulk and Thor together), to the most ridiculous character motivational change in the history of Marvel films (looking at you Valkyrie), Thor 3 is a completely wasted story that fails to live up to the hype on almost every conceivable level. I say ""almost"" as the Hulk once again proves a success, adding a layer of development we seem to get to his character in every Marvel film he is in. Other new and returning characters do not fair so well. I'm trying to understand why Tessa Thompson was raved about so much. Forgiving that the character has been completely redesigned from the comicbooks, she is so underdeveloped I have little comprehension why she hates Asgard in the first place, and then returns so quickly by Thor's side. Perhaps the tequila wore off. There's nothing wrong with her performance, there just isn't anything three-dimensional to her character. Loki. God Loki. He's just Loki. Again. It doesn't matter what this guy does, he's just constantly forgiven - for absolutely no reason when his crimes are looked at in the cold light of day. For God's sake Thor, Hela was attempting to do nothing that Loki had already done. It makes no sense. As for Scurge...was he actually even in it? Why was he in it? What purpose did he have?Hela - well, as a design and character, she looked the part, had an awesome power set and an interesting take on things. She probably had some really great reasons for doing what she was doing, when she was doing them. We just, like every other Marvel villain, never get to fully flesh them out. I can't help but think there was a great character there, played by the right person, but its never truly allowed to flourish and gather weight. The ""re-writing"" of the Universe is also a little hard to take with her introduction. Nobody seems to question it. Everybody just accepts it. Not for me I'm afraid. Here's hoping that Avengers 3 can bring this MCU ship back, cause at the moment, the last two films have veered massively off course."
28 April 2020,e-67102-48412,5,8,9,The best one in the Thor series,"Good-looking, better than the first two. The scene is spectacular and the visual effect is gorgeous. There is no lack of humor between the characters. Hulk is cuter, but also a little proud. Locky is also good and evil, still very attractive. Hella interprets what is called the Queen's gas field. Hammer brother has no highlights and is slightly boring in the previous Marvel movies. In this department, the charm is infinite, the humor is funny, and the characters are completed. Transformation. Is that the final war with Hella was a little hasty."
5 November 2017,Movie-ManDan,7,14,6,Not Bad. But This 8.2 Rating Needs To Go Down A Lot!,"The superhero picture has really overstayed their welcome. I don't mean just Marvel, but DC and others. There's too many clichés, everything is too superficial and everything blends too well with others of similar nature. Now, superhero films are being targeted towards younger children with overly-stylized and colourful sets, and some of the worst jokes possible. Superhero movies now a lacking seriousness and passion that used to make them great. These ones now are far too silly to be taken seriously.While comedy is violently stuffed in these films, the main thing that kept the latest Thor movie from being more than just ""okay"" is that the story made no sense and all the characters were out of place. Dr. Strange appears in it just because. There's some cool monsters in it just because. Cate Blanchett parades around the majority of the movie just because. I know people dig just seeing random cameos and cool things for no apparent reason other than to look cool.Thor and Loki's sibling rivalry is still rocky. Thor either awakens or happens to come across Ragnarok. Cate Blanchett the human version of Rag? Already forgotten and don't care the least. Thor gets transported to a universe (maybe just a planet, but no biggie) where fights happen like UFC. His opponent is the Hulk. We've all seen the excerpt from the trailers. Well Thor's escapades in that universe are weak with uninteresting characters leading the way. And you guessed it: bad jokes! Meanwhile on Earth (or whatever planet the main story is) has Cate Blanchett taking over. She looks cool, but is rather bland. And still: bad jokes!I know that this movie tries to be part comedy, but please don't. The jokes in all the movies (except for Iron Man) are horrible movies that only 6-year-olds will be amused with. Next Marvel movie, please don't force so many jokes!! NONE OF THEM ARE FUNNY!!!!So the jokes suck, the characters suck and are out of place, the stories make no sense, but the action and special effects though...wow! The opening scene has Thor fighting Ragnarok which blew me away. The fight between Hulk and Thor is awesome. There's a few other scenes of breathtaking visuals and sweet action that I loved!This movie is a standard pass.2.5/4"
3 November 2017,SureCommaNot,10,19,3,Couldn't suspend my disbelief,"Did I just witness an MCU Theatrical Release? It felt like a straight-to-DVD, non-canonical experiment. The things in the film that did make sense, only served to undermine or undo all that has been accomplished in these characters' trajectories over the past few years. And I tried to think of exceptions to that statement, but that only increased my frustration.For example, the character of Loki will always be a favorite, and the tension between his villainy and the love his brother has for him always works well for me (including in this film), but the setup we got in the last film (with Loki deceiving everyone into thinking he's Odin) was scrapped and simply laughed off. Same thing with Thor's intense connection with Jane, which we've been developing over time: laughed off. And Thor's vow to Doctor Strange? Also laughed off. Didn't we witness Thor learn honor and integrity over the years? And yet he vows to take Loki and his father and return straight to Asgard, which he eventually does do, but in the end he has the choice of taking everyone anywhere in the nine realms, and where does he choose? The exact planet he'd promised to vacate. At least with Skurge the question of loyalty showed some inner vexation, but even that felt out of character.So much made no sense. Why does constantly raining trash on Sakaar make such teeny tiny piles? And why is the entire population of Asgard so tiny too? Why do the sets feel so fake? Why are none of the jokes funny? Why does Thor refer to his experiences with the Avengers as ""work"" (as if his God-of-Thunder duties are something he goes home from)? I hated that line in the preview. Why does Thor express no sorrow when his close band of warrior friends is killed? What are Hela's powers, and why do she and her costume instantly recover from stabbings? Why does Hela's admittedly bad-ass crown change back and forth between two distinct styles (sometimes covering her cheekbones, and sometimes not)? And if Thor has a mystical power (namely, the ability to mask his hammer as an umbrella), why combine that with a scene where Thor is being subjected to Doctor Strange's tricks, making it seem like the umbrella deception is Doctor Strange's doing? It's needlessly confusing. And what's the reason the Hulk is stuck as the Hulk, not returning to Banner form (nor increasing in size when attacked during combat) for two years? And why did the first teaser trailer ruin so many important plot points? (I'm SO glad I didn't watch the later previews, which ruin even more of the story.) Oh, and if you're going to give a rock creature a voice, why choose a vocal style so dependent on nuanced lip control, rather than a back-of-the-throat voice? All these things take the audience out of the movie.This film had so much potential, so many opportunities wasted. Take Hela's healing for example: the camera never focuses on how she's impervious to stabbings, and this could have been a profound cause of fear and suspense for the characters, rather than a cause of audience disbelief. We also got a build-up of suspense when the Hulk attacks the flaming giant Surtur, but then he quickly and awkwardly retreats, anti-climactically. Also bizarre: when Odin dies, we aren't given the chance to linger in the moment, and Thor certainly doesn't seem shaken up about it. Even the torturous murder of the Grandmaster's cousin is laughed off. And the actors were allowed to ad-lib too much; there was immense potential for some really good lines, but these opportunities were wasted too. Just lazy.Oh, and the '80s-style synth music felt really forced, like it were added on later because it's popular. The new Blade Runner handled this much, much better. Thor: Ragnarok just felt slapped-together."
12 December 2020,kamrank50,4,5,7,It's complicated!,"Thor : Ragnarok is a difficult movie for me to rate and also write a review about.
I have to say that - overall - I do enjoy watching the movie; I have watched it more than twice.
Overall, though, I would argue that this movie has some major flaws - in my humble opinion - as follow:
> I do not have a problem, in principle with a little bit of humour in an otherwise serious movie. Humour in this movie, however, I will say has gone too far- so much so, that it is attempting to make Thor a comedy.
> The use of different accents for different characters seems to me to be a further attempt yo transform the story into a comedy, and I, personally very much disagree with it. It is plain silly!
> Again this is my personal opinion : but there are some things that you just simply do not play around with : the concept of an English-speaking, highly vocal, beads-around-the-neck-wearing Hulk is simply laughable.
> As a NZer, i can relate to the humor and (regardless of the disdain I have for the Kiwi director) do enjoy watching the movie... but the geek in me insists that some things are sacred :
you do not turn Thor into a comic character - Thor does not crack jokes (all the f*ing time)Hulk has been a well-known character for decades... you do not put beads around his neck and suddenly decide he's vocali enjoy a bit of humor... but thou shalt not go overboard!Personal opinion - obviously.
My two cents' worth!"
29 October 2017,ace_mu,55,98,9,God of Thunder with Epic Conclusion,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Thor Ragnarok directed by Taika Waititi that brought you What We Do in the Shadows definitely gave me the perfect ending to Asgard. There is so many emotions that was brilliantly executed by Waititi. Worthy inclusion of Led Zeppelin The Immigrant Song that plays through first battle scene of Thor. Anytime the song plays it give me chills and full of epicness while grinning the entire time. People complains the movie is full of jokes and not having the stakes. Well, let me tell you that is not true. Thor Ragnarok actually managed to pull serious and brutal moments when it needs to. You know what??? I had have never felt the movie is full of comedy at all. Now, let's talk about the villain. Hela the goddess of death is definitely ranked at my top 5 Marvel villains. Valkyrie steal the show for me as a badass drunk warrior. In conclusion, it is a memorable movie for me and it is worth watching. I might go watching it again."
9 May 2020,DrTuvok,4,6,8,"The last good movie of the MCU, the first in a long time...","The Good: It's a straight-forward comedy which is just one small step away from the giddy highs of the most iconic slapstick movies. There are a lot of action scenes, (usually the worst parts of any Marvel movie), but only a few of them are boring. (Hulk arena fight and a couple other forgettable ones). Led Zeppelin brightens some of the other fight scenes into camp. The plenitude of jokes mostly all land, why are Kiwis so good at doing this...? Jeff Goldblum plays himself on the planet he originally came from and it's hilarious. His no. 1 stooge is played by the same Kiwi actress who played the child welfare lady in Watiti's own Hunt for the Wilderpeople and she's even funnier here. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have their comic-duo routine down by now after rehearsal in Thor the Dark World. Mark Ruffalo exaggerates his own neurotic-ness so much you can only laugh at how ridiculous he is. There are actually several very funny verbal exchanges that left me impressed at the writers. Maybe Watiti should write more scripts. The designs are so refreshingly retro; I wish more modern movies looked as clunky as this. Overall it reminded me of Star Trek the Voyage Home: a Marvel movie for people who don't usually like Marvel movies. And, it's way funnier than the vapid losers who pass for comedians today, Kimmel, Colbert, Fallon, and all those other hacks.The Bad: The storyline is the same superhero dribble we've all seen a million times before and since; if it would have gone full-blown Bob Hope it could have been a 10-star movie, sure. The Asgard plotlines were kind of boring. On top of that, this is the biggest and most expensive insult to Norse mythology I have ever seen. The Norse Ragnarok was an incredibly serious and apocalyptic event and this movie reduces it to a punchline; people will now think of this screwy movie whenever it is mentioned. A lower-stakes comedic plot would have done wonders. Meanwhile, there are some green screens and CGI, but the humor mostly distracts from it. The shoe-horned in Doctor Strange scene should be excised, have a little respect for people watching this fifty years in the future who won't have the luxury of wasting 100+ hours of their lives watching repetitive Marvel films and keeping up with the mythology of them.The Ugly: The Valkyrie character teetered dangerously into the territory of a Jerk Sue, someone who is mean and rude but tolerated by all the characters. If you like lady wrestlers maybe you won't mind this."
2 September 2020,jackpatrick-65727,7,11,9,The best movie in the Thor Trilogy!!,"Thor Ragnarok's an outstandingly hilarious movie from start to finish, the performances were marvelous, the music was great, the story was interesting, and the ending was really good. Hela is a worthy antagonist to Thor in this installment. A con is that it was way too light-hearted, and some scenes like Odin's death that needed emotional weight didn't get any of that. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is the best MCU movie of the year and the best Thor movie in the trilogy."
2 November 2017,mounirrmaged,14,26,2,Officially one of the worst movie trilogies in my book,"Thor:Ragnarok, the very movie that got crazy praise, the movie that everyone is gushing over it. The movie that people claim it ""brought back"" the fun in superhero movies. But is it really worth all of this high acclaim? I can safely say that it doesn't. Just another over- hyped, generic garbage from the MCU. And to make stuff clear, no I don't hate ""fun"", and I am no elitist (be it as a comic book fan or as a movie Buff). I simply want a quality movie, no matter how its done or constructed. And this movie cares less about all of this and focuses way too much on humor that it overshadows other important elements of the movie. To explain myself, I have nothing against escapism. When the movie sells itself and doesn't lie about its nature (whether its a heist, a simple action film or just a comedy), I don't go there expecting a cerebral masterpiece. But I don't expect it to be a mindless filler that's sole existence is to kill 2 hours of my time without any other context or purpose whatsoever. So far, the movie is getting insane reputation, having high praise almost as other great comic book movies such as logan and the dark knight. But for these two movies, I can understand why logan and the dark knight get such high acclaim. Both completely reinvented the superhero genre in their own unique ways, by giving moral subtext and an engaging story. Thor:Ragnarok doesn't care about such. And yet its praised for its entertainment factor. Now ask yourself: is there really anything worth of such praise aside from how much ""fun"" the movie is? I still don't understand the praise for this movie. Its entertaining, but it is a bad movie. It's another proof that the MCU cares more about avengers movie than having a satisfying film. It exists solely to fill in the wait for infinity war.It suffers what other comic book movies do: there is no conclusion or a satisfying ending. They're focusing way too much on the next projects. Character development is almost non-existent, as well as character relationships. All of the relationships rely on cheap, gimmicky comedy instead of seeing real characters interacting with each other. None of the characters feel natural. In fact, it feels like the actors are merely cosplaying. And as usual, marvel shows they have no respect for the source material. I'm no comic book elitist, and my knowledge of Thor isn't that of a die-hard one, but I know enough to spot when the character is bastardized. I'm sorry, but a Thor who cracks jokes left and right while being captured and his home world being destroyed isn't who Thor is. Thor was more of a noble warrior who speaks in ye old English, almost Shakespearean style. The previous movies failed not because of the tone, but because the writing and acting was lazy, thus you don't care about him. And this movie suffers pretty much the same problem. And the other stories, as well as the hulk and Valkyrie, feel wasted. They are used unwisely. Both deserve better than just being in a film. In fact, planet hulk should have its own movie, not being a pointless subplot in a Thor film. And about the whole ""fun"" aspect, I hate that. I hate that mentality in which the movie is praised simply because its fun. Getting all of this love just because you are entertained. But aside from that? The movie has nothing to it. Its being treated like its the first fun comic book movie we had in years. Have people forgotten about guardians of the galaxy vol. 2? Or was it generic and forgettable that people DID forget it? Overall, over-hyped garbage that doesn't deserve any of the praise. One of the worst marvel movies, and the most disappointing movie of the year (even though I had no expectations)"
24 January 2018,phoenixinvictus,7,13,4,What will they need to destroy next?,"Add a few gags, lots of boom-boom explosions and a couple of fight scenes and destroy something really big and leave in the oven for two hours and feed the slop to the audience. It seems like a sure recipe for bleeding the franchise.Odin dies and apparently the only thing keeping his sadistic (uber powerful) blood thirsty daughter is his remaining alive??? Any explications on how that works? No? Well it just does and Odin just dies because it is needed to further the plot. So there.We witness a fight between Thor and Hulk. Yes I would have liked to have seen that battle play out if it wasn't for the fact that Hulk looks more like an ogre than Bruce Banner's alter ego. I mean Hulk looks so cute in his armour, his hammer and his axe... Why this apparatus? Because we need to sell much more toys for Hulk. It's not enough to own a Hulk doll you need to push those greedy little brats to demand from their parents those extras. Which leads me to the other conclusion that this movie is for kids.Why did they waste the cameo appearances of Matt Damon and Sam Niell with such silly appearances? Hela, the goddess of Death who's power is to shoot magical swords at people and fight an entire army one at a time and raise an army of zombie warriors with magic fire. I just couldn't stop rolling my eyes when I saw Skurge, played by Karl Urban, firing a pair of M-16's with what seems to have a limitless amount of ammo (probably magical M-16's).Last, but certainly not least, the apparent TARDIS ship that comes to save the Asgardians. I call it a TARDIS ship for how else can you explain a ship that can take so many people in such a small space? Thor let his home be destroyed and is no hero for the fact. It was all part of the prophecy... so much for making your own fate.Now that a planet has been destroyed what is left for Marvel to blow up? The entire Universe maybe?"
21 November 2018,iquine,4,7,9,Perhaps...Best Super Hero Film I've Seen...Top 3?,"(Flash Review)And the most apropos usage of Led Zeppelin's ""The Immigrant Song"" I've ever seen! I did have recently loooow super hero movie expectations after seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. First off, this was actually really funny with the right tone of humor for a big movie like this. Such as super heroes using their super powers used for insignificant and routine things. There were actually good excuses for super heroes to battle each other rather than a rumble at an airport. The best part was the plot was well-written and compelling. The special effects felt...well...special. Basically, the plot is that Thor discovers that he has an evil sister who claims the throne of Asgard. Thor has been imprisoned across the universe and must fight in a gladiator match to free himself; his opponent turns out to be the Incredible Hulk. Good action fight ensues. Thor needs to resolve that predicament and get back to Asgard to save his home. Very fun and entertaining action movie!"
30 October 2017,adam-whelan0,27,50,1,Wannabe Guardians of the Galaxy,"This was terrible it felt like a GotG knock-off. The ""jokes"" weren't funny and felt forced. He is meant to be the Mighty Thor but in this he's more the incredibly stupid Thor and the Hulk was like a spoiled teenager. I don't know why Marvel would turn a film about the death and destruction of Asgard into a feel good comedy for the whole family. Thor has to have the worst trilogy in the Marvel Comedic Universe"
23 July 2019,jakegylly,3,4,7,Awful,"The characters in this movie are so childish especially hulk
all the characters are making joke about themselves especially Thor I wonder how many times he repeated the dialogue that he is the god of thunder
Hela has the power to break Thor's hammer but at the end got defeated by sutur how silly it is
Valkyrie role is disgusting there is too much overacting in her role
Finally this is children movie with too many flaws hardly one time watch,bad script,vfx good that's it"
29 October 2017,stonez_74,52,92,9,Ragnarock is flawed but good !,"I just got home from Thor: Rganarock and boy, it was a fun movie. I am really happy that they went in a different direction with comedy rather then with the boring suffering and seriousness of Thor 1 and 2.Thor has short hair which works, mjollnir getting destroyed does not affect the story, and maybe will be a future objective for Thor to restore it in upcoming movies.They made the Hulk talk which is awesome, this also makes him have a personality and he becomes quite likable.Cate Blanchett is amazing as usual, also heads up for Idris Elba and Tom as usual, he being regarded as a fan favorite.As I mentioned there is a lot of comedy, but its not overused and this time it actually works, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 style, which gives a great tone to the movie.The end is maybe a little confusing, where Asgard is being destroyed. I mean Thor can't defeat Hela, but the fire monster can, but Thor at the beginning of the movie destroyed the fire monster ? Maybe cuz he had Mjollnir ? Whatever. I reckon they needed to destroy somehow Asgard to move the story forward, but they could have done it in a different way.Also very good visuals all around, but heads up for the scavenger trash planet looks absolutely amazing, they they made it look really sci-fi looking, the city, spaceships etc, like something you would see maybe in star wars, or blade-runner, well not actually but sort of, which is kinda good.The action is very good, the story is simple so there is not much not to like.All in all a very good viewing, if you like humour, good action go and see it.I give it a 9/10."
16 July 2021,jace_the_film_guy,9,19,10,Nothing Short of Miraculous,"What Taika Waititi did for Thor is nothing short of miraculous. He took the most boring and stiff character in the MCU and made him the centerpiece of a space comedy. He completely rebranded Thor with a bright colors, a fresh haircut, and a wit that rivals Tony Stark.From start to finish, Thor: Ragnarok is incredibly fun to watch. It was genuinely funny, but it did not sacrifice emotion for shallow laughs. You still feel for Thor when his father dies, when mjolnir is destroyed and when he ultimately needs to unleash Ragnarok on Asgard.In addition, not only do we get to further the development of two brilliant recurring characters like Loki and Bruce but we are also introduced to exciting new characters like Valkyrie, Korg and the Grandmaster. When I think about going back and rewatching superhero films, Ragnarok is one of the top, if not at the top, of the list."
7 November 2017,emiliecunning-21094,12,22,10,"Knew it would be good, but it turned out to be amazing.","I was generally unsure of whether I wanted to go see the movie at first - sure, it had appeal because of Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, and I very much enjoyed the first two Thor movies but this one looked a bit intense and zany to me from the trailer. BUT OH MY GOD I LOVED THIS FILM. EVERY MINUTE OF IT. It was really, really great! I did not at all expect to enjoy it just this much, I feel like I want to go see it again!The main thing that sets it apart from other Marvel movies is the comic quality, which unexpectedly comes mostly from Thor himself. Hemsworth was really wonderful in this movie, allowing us to see a more comic side to Thor certainly missing from a lot the first Thor film where he is far more serious. Then there's also Jeff Goldblum, who as a natural comic and entertainer, is just wonderful in his role as the eccentric Grand Master. I certainly didn't expect to laugh as much in this movie as I did, and literally at one point could not stop laughing from one of Thor's lines! Plus, the director's own role as Korg, the rock being, is an equally brilliant comic element within the film. The comedy combined with the amazing visuals as well as the zany and bizarre theme to the film which I believe is generated by the artistic direction of Taika Waititi makes this film a must-see. I was really pleased to see the progression of characters within this film without anything feeling forced by some agenda, it all just falls into place, especially in regards to Thor and Loki - the latter of whom I am particularly glad to see a ray of hope in the midst of his mischievous ways! Then, the introduction of Valkyrie is I think also a very good thing as she is a strong female character who surely has flaws but is also beautiful and bad-ass. Bruce Banner/The Hulk is also an interesting progression of character in the film - we actually see the Hulk speak instead of just always grunting and fighting, but then we realize Banner has actually been the Hulk for two years and hasn't transformed back so this is obviously something Banner struggles to come to terms with.Overall, I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of cheering up, it provides such a great escape from our daily realities and submerges you into a world of fantasy. The inclusion of LED ZEPPELIN'S IMMIGRANT SONG twice in the movie is also AWESOME!!!"

                        ",Could Be Better,"I would have given it a better rating had they not done the standard Marvel Diversity change of characters. Valkyrie is a BLOND HAIRED BLUE EYED WOMAN in the comic, she is not a black woman with attitude which is all we seem to see these days in Marvel movies. Asgardians are warriors, but of course in this movie the population turns into a mass of scared people that have to be saved by a few people who wear armor or carry swords. Another star removed for the bad writing and plot hole. Casting Karl Urban as a bad guy is a WASTE of both his talents and acting ability. Its MUCH better than the normal SJW movies Marvel has been putting out but it could have been better."
12 November 2017,christopher79-211-462007,70,138,1,Not good movie,"I'm so so disappointed from this movie, ridiculous Thor - Hulk - Loki. why why so ridiculous humiliation movie why? why? That movie is serious movie not movie for fun, who want to see a movie with a fun can choose a comedy movie not that movie... THOR... OMG guys come on fix a good serious movie with the Marvel..... How can i see now the Avengers 3 how?? how gonna be that movie? ridiculous movie, if i want to see a movie with a fun, i gonna choose a comedy movie to see, not that movie ''THOR''... that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life... I'm not gonna spent my money again for that movies at cinema.... Sorry Guys you disappointed me so much...."
3 February 2018,anthonyf-22565,15,26,1,"This movie is painfully awful, even for a Marvel film.","I was never a huge fan of the Thor movies, quite frankly I'm actually not a huge fan of the Marvel movies. Some are okay, while others are just complete and utter garbage.When I watch a Marvel movie, it's quite easy to know what to expect: stimulating action sequences, special effects, and an easy-to-follow story line. Basically, these movies are aimed towards a mass audience. The majority of the audience however is made up of 13-year-olds, while also making it JUST ""cool"" enough to appeal to maybe their parents or older siblings.You start to think, ""Okay, you know what, these movies aren't so bad. I could watch one of these once in awhile. They're fun, they're easy, and they're enjoyable on some levels."" That's pretty much where Marvel movies stand with me.Anyway, back to Thor. I've always liked Thor over a lot of other Marvel movies because it was more serious. The Thor universe is that of Viking Norse myth legend and resembled that olden time of swords and shields and things. I'm a huge fan of fantasy so that reciprocated well with me. The first two Thor movies were decent at best. I wasn't in awe when the credits rolled, I didn't tell all my friends about it - but it was a decent watch, a good way to kill some time. It wasn't my desired movie experience by any means. Then again, I know what to expect when I watch a Marvel movie so movies like that have become sort of like a break for me from other movies that I try to watch.So I put on Thor: Ragnarok, hoping to get that fun, easy, pretty cool movie... And I came to find out that this movie is a steaming pile of hot garbage.What a complete turn in the wrong direction for the Marvel franchise and especially for the character of Thor, and the Hulk for that matter. Since when was Thor witty? Since when did the Hulk talk like a f**king baby rather than a pissed off green giant that's too big for his own good? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE?Let's name some other things wrong with this movie...""Hey, Thor fans, remember everything vital to the storyline of Thor 1 and 2? You do? Okay, well just forget all of that because Thor has a sister! Yeah, he has a sister and Asgard actually became as prestigious and powerful because of her doing. Yup, yup... I know, it's f**king stupid but just roll with it okay?""Yeah... also, everyone BESIDES Thor and Loki knew about their sister, Hela.More things wrong with this movie...
The music is bad. When Thor and Loki go to Earth, nobody notices them, ESPECIALLY LOKI WHO TRIED TO DESTROY THE EARTH (good job creating a Marvel universe). Everything involving Hela doesn't even matter in the end because Surtur destroys everything anyway. The planet Thor and Loki land on is like fruity Mad Max/John Carter land and isn't in the slightest bit interesting or has any character to it besides the fact that it's filled with garbage and there's a gladiator stadium. Characters like Korg and Miek actually mean nothing besides plans for the future in this s**tty franchise. Thor is restrained by the Grandmaster by a piece of metal in his neck that jolts him with electricity...""Wait what? You're telling me that THE GOD OF THUNDER, who has lightning going through his veins is suppressed by a tiny jolt of electricity in his neck?""Yeah... this movie is trash. I could sit here for hours telling you the things wrong with this movie and how bad the CGI is but I'll just wrap this up by saying this movie is painfully awful and you shouldn't waste your time sitting through it. When the movie is trying to be funny, it's not. Holy s**t is it not funny. However, when the movie is trying to be serious, it's hilarious.I'm so done with the Thor franchise. Seriously, how many times is Loki going to try to betray Thor and just get forgiven for it?The amount of positive reviews for this film is actually disgusting. If this is the direction Marvel is heading, I'm actually scared to see what comes next."
5 November 2017,tkentsh,44,80,4,I guess Ragnarok is not that serious,"I really thought this movie would be better than it was but it was more like another Guardians of the Galaxy with a another super lame villain. Sorry but there was nothing great about Hela or Cate Blanchett's performance. Just another generic villain with a lame back story and all of sudden is Thor's sister. Also her powers were stupid. Cool you can shoot spikes...so powerful. Fenrir and Surtur were barely part of the movie and were lame as well. How can there be so many jokes going on when the Queen and King of Asgard are both dead and things are looking bad? Like your home is destroyed and you barely seem to care. Some other stupid parts of this movie:The warriors three die like immediately. They had good roles in the first 2 movies I guess their contract was up now. So let's kill them off. Odin barely has a part. Same with Doctor Strange. Heimdall was underused. Barely said anything and almost got killed by some undead soldiers. Seriously? This guy broke out of ice how could he almost die to some undead soldiers?Jane Foster, Erik Selvig, and Darcy completely missing. Tessa Thompson did not really add much to the movie either. Just another person to help get off Sakaar. Korg was funny but also similar to Tessa Thompson. Overall I felt like there was a lot of jumping around. From one planet to the next and Ragnarok was not that big of deal. If this movie never happened I do not think it would affect anything in the Marvel Universe especially if Hela and Surtur do not appear in Infinity War."
30 March 2020,twbond-00867,3,4,9,"Action-packed, great storytelling, very funny, and a well-deserved sequel.","Marvel Studios' Thor: Ragnarok is packed full of ""unthorgetable"" fun and exciting depth as part of one unforgettable saga. The film excels in its humour, with some scenes that deliver emotional moments with the complex relationship with brother, half-brother, and father (Thor, Loki, Odin) and a satisfying friendship with both the God of Thunder and the ""big guy,"" the tremendous, loveable Incredible Hulk. The story itself is brilliantly created also. Without Thor's hammer, according to reviews, he is ""still worthy.""As the movie continues to strive in it's action, comedy, and the story, it certainly beats the opportunities of what Thor: The Dark World tried to conquer, and with it's threequel, characters like Heimdell get more shine until he is killed off by the Mad Titan (Thanos) in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War. From there on, it excels with the fascinating and well-created atmosphere of worlds such as Asgard, like it's predecessors, and the newly garbage planet Sakaar. The Hulk, after a few years of being absent from piloting the Quinjet in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Age Of Ultron, performs a top-notch portrayal with more of a humanised version, both he and the Mighty Thor are fantastic!The ending sets the stakes high with Infinity War just right round the corner, it gives fans the story and the performance what they deserve. This movie, as a whole, is funny, intriguingly emotional, and a likeable candidate to the MCU saga.A 9/10 to the Asgardians, to the big green guy, to the Sakaar people, and to the filmmakers behind this movie, ""because that's what directors do."""
8 November 2017,adean81,11,20,8,Review for Thor: Ragnarok,"One word for this movie. Awesome! Going into seeing the movie, I was super excited. When the movie was over I still had a huge smile on my face, both times I've seen it. Right from the beginning, the movie starts off with a bang. From the great comedic lines to the Led Zepplin music blasting as Thor wields his mighty hammer in battle. Which provided a great use of the hammer, considering it is destroyed early on.It might sound weird to say that the best part of a Thor movie is the comedy, but it's true. Ragnarok is hilarious and at times simply delightful. You can't help but smile and laugh when watching this film. Chirs Hemsworth as Thor is great with the comedic elements. Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster also adds a lot of fun to the movie. My surprise favorite character is the rock creature Korg. He's a great side character that provides brief moments of laughter. He's played by the film's director, Taika Watiti. From the trailers, we all knew that the Incredible Hulk was in the movie. The fight in the arena between Hulk and Thor was spectacular. Hulk is hilarious and does a great job smashing things. His alter ego Bruce Banner has some great moments in the movie, part of which is him struggling with his identity as Hulk. It's also great to see Loki back. He's still at his same old tricks, but a great moment is when he first sees the Hulk and immediately says that he needs to leave. Which is a great call back to their encounter in the first Avenger's movie. Two great additions to the Thor and Marvel movies are the two female leads. Hela played by Cate Blanchet and Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson. The villain of the movie, Hela, was a powerful and commanding threat against Thor. Valkyrie interacted so well with Hulk and Thor, and got her own character arc, fighting like a true warrior in the end.Benedict Cumberbatch's reprises his role as Doctor Strange in a short scene. Which is a continuation of the end credit scene he had with Thor at the end of the movie Doctor Strange. A couple of surprise cameos on Thor's home world of Asgard involve the people performing a play reenacting Loi's death scene from Thor: The Dark World. Unlike Captain America: Civil War, which felt more like an Avenger's movie, Thor: Ragnarok is very much a Thor film. The whole story revolves around Thor, characters from the Thor movies, and the realm of Asgard. This is the best Thor movie, and one of the most fun and delightful of any Marvel movies to date. The action is great, the comedy is hilarious and pacing keeps moving. There's not a boring part in the movie, and only increases my anticipation and excitement for the next Avenger's movie."
8 November 2017,LittleNiniel,22,41,2,Unsuspected Cringefest,"Do you know how much it sucks to say that this movie was a cringefest? Yes, that comes from someone who have actually enjoyed the previously hated Thor movies and who's Thor is my favorite Avenger. There were warning signs and for the longest time I was being very negative until I started seeing so many positive reviews of the movie. But instead ten minutes into the movie I get this gutted feeling that this is cringeworthy. That I hate the idea of having to sit through this all. Alright so the thing is I don't like sci fi so that wasn't a good sign. Why do I watch this kind of movie then? Again, I love Thor. I loved the second movie despite it's flaws because it had more of a historic/fantasy feel to it. It wasn't all bright and funny all the bloody time. It had moments with heart and even a lengthy funeral scene for a character we never really got much reason to love or to know. This movie? This movies re-introduces us to characters such as Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun. Then they're dead and gone within the minute never to be mentioned again. No time to feel one bit. No sad music. No reaction from Thor - his bestfriends. Just straight to humor and moving on. It was gut wrenching for all the wrong reasons.That's my major issue here. Any hope for heart this movie had was replaced with humor. And people praise it. Is this what people want? 80s video game with no pause. No heart. No character? Seriously? Hell yeah I admit the first Thor movies has their awful issues too, but as mentioned above I don't always need quality to enjoy a movie, but I do need some heart. I don't need all this f*cking humor.There are moments with so much potential for emotions without making it all so sappy, but still was ruined by humor. Thor and Loki talking and Thor tells his brother that he always loved and admired him from the get go but Loki never saw this. Then it's cut short with Thor thorwing Loki around. Why are you ruining the few moments of quiet and emotion with more bloody humor?This movie is called Ragnarok so the only thing it got going for it regarding that is that they actually do blow up Asgard. Full time! Kudos to that. Of course we get a moment of ""Aw shite"" and ""I might feel sadness, but it'll probably be ""funny"" soon too"" before that too turns out to be true. There's so much potential for good story telling and it wastes it.Let's try some of the positive things before I loose my mind eh? Fenrir the wolf shows up! Potential point wasted. So underused. He's massive and cool, but he doesn't really do that much. He fight Hulk and falls off the rainbow bridge. With a more serious movie with funny moments characters like this could be so cool and dark and used to the fullest!A lot of good actors, but with so little heart and soul I was just left feeling like they're... just there? Tom Hiddleston as Loki is missing something. He feels... forced? And looks disturbingly much like a certain Tommy Wiseau to the point it was horrifying! Chris is a funny guy and a good actor, but the humor isn't funny. Many of the characters are good and all. But not really given neither time or heart for much more. Again, potential? I loved Heimdall's part. Maybe because they reminded me more of the earthy fantasy feel of The Dark World than the SCI Fi of Ragnarok and I liked that? Heimdall in general was great. Almost surprised they didn't just kill him too as worthlessly as they did the worriors three. Probably because Idris Elba? Also liked Karl Urban's character. Might even have felt something when he sacreficed himself if they had given any reason to feel anything but supposed humor in this soulless money wasting movie. - Some parts of the final showdown was cool? Only moments though because again and again something else jumps in to ruin a moment. Usually humor. Or the music. The music is hideous again and just pulled me right back out of the movie. Thor, Valkyrie and Banner talk about how Loki always tries to kill someone and Thor tells an amusing story of how as an eight year old Loki turned into a snake. Thor tells this story in a way that is actually very funny for once. It was one of maybe three moments that got a chuckle out of me. Never a laugh. There might be some small moments in there that I liked too, but not worth wasting my time on anymore. People go on and on about how The Hobbit movies were just one big nasty CGI party, but what on earth was this then? In The Dark World at least they went to Norway to film the background scenery for Asgard. They filmed at Iceland for other planets... This movie is all CGI. All green screen. All bright colors and just no depths. Now that I have gotten this off my chest I'd rather move on and pretend this never happened.Superficial cringefest not at all worthy of any praise it has gotten."
29 October 2017,S_t_a_r_g_a_z_e_r,370,731,1,Feels like a Monty Python' version of Thor,"(There might be some spoilers ahead but very vague.)I grew up with Marvel comics and Thor was always my favorite. None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing."
22 January 2018,chr36,4,6,5,A comedy and a joke.,"Although I like Thor films, this one had a bit too much comedy. I don't remember DC Comics having this much. I liked it when Thor didn't get his ass handed to him so often. It reminds me of a TV drama.
I'm not too keen on sword fighting and the hammer being destroyed was a bummer. Thor screaming like a child?
Why not adds Chris Rock and Benny Hill? The comedy was really good, just not from a movie like Thor.
All time low. 5/10"

6 November 2017,umashankarpati1997,10,19,9,By far MCU's best standalone movie. And Yes THOR RAGNA-ROCKS.,"Thor: Ragnarok wastes no time cranking up its camp factor, which continues as he endures a ""prepare for the world's end"" rant from the massive demon Surtur. Thor repeatedly asks Surtur to pause his rant because he's slowly spinning around while hanging from a mess of chains. ""I feel like we had something there,"" Thor says while waiting for eye contact to return. The story is truly serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the new ""Revengers"" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favorite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. Cate Blanchett just nails her role as the goddess of death. She is the show stealer, her attitude her walk everything is just perfect. The fight scenes are just amazing. The CGI in those scenes are perfect. Humor in this movie is just marvelous. The last scene which displays the Thor force was icing on the cake. Believe me I am big DC fan but this movie is just mind blowing. Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act.  This movie is MCU's finest stand alone movie."
3 November 2017,proishaanpuripro,15,27,4,More Like Guardians of the Ragnarok!,"Yes, Guardians of the Galaxy did great (both parts), but that doesn't mean you are gonna recycle it again and again. This is Thor franchise, don't fuse and combine it with other space related series and make a mix-max mess. Both series have unique identity, you change Chris Hemsworth to Chris Pratt and vice-versa for the rest of the characters you got yourself GOTG-Part:2.5. The whole Thor realizing his powers and utilizing it against the main antagonist at the near is the same rehash of Star-lord using his new found powers at the end of part 2 and both scenes uses a soundtrack while both embracing the use of 80s science-fiction colorful style. You know there's one thing that seems to bother me a lot that everyone tends to forget while making a review of this movie is how Thor's old team from the previous two prequels gets easily killed off in the background without any remorse and painful cinematic scenes, just to be in the favor of introducing ""new characters"".-And Disney/Marvel back at it again with its usual PC culture and forced diversity. You know, your diversity really speaks of hypocrisy when it concerns itself with African-American people only. Yes, i get it and i really understand your ancestors were enslaved, as an Indian, my people were slaved too and maybe suffered a far more gruesome fate, but doesn't mean you are gonna show a white character getting slaved by a black character in the movie quietly and silently and let it slide and everyone will treat it as shits and giggle like this whole movie is. All sorts of controversy would be surrounding this movie if the same situation happened, but the roles were reversed. Anyway, back to the diversity topic, where are the Asian people? There was one guy who got killed in the first part and had a really really small and minor role. Now, should i be offended and ""triggered"" by this movie as for how it treats Asian people? I fear we are only gonna see more of it from here on in future, the marvel comics already suffers from it and the low sales fully describe they have hit new bottom low with Female thor, black captain America, black spider-man etc, next comes the MCU.:The reaction. Oh, how much i wish i would have never typed ""Thor:Ragnarok"" on google, i was still ready to give this movie 5.5 or 6/10 because at least it does a marvelous job at the CGI effects, we sure as heck came a long way from Thor I and any movie that utilize 80s synthwave and retrowave music is always a plus in my dictionary and gets extra scores just for that, but the amount of ""movie critics and journalists"" have given this 10/10 solely based on ""Queerest characters, most powerful blackest black person, how Valkyire is Bi and few other characters"" is just too darn high like what the heck? This movie never even explores anyone's sexuality, it doesn't even have any kind of romance at all, it is even less than subtle unless you force yourself to think that way and the fact that every review has one thing in common which is ""Bring both your boys and girls to watch this movie"". For the love of god, let it be just a kids movie for heck sakes, don't bring gender politics to them, they are just naive and innocent, i don't think they really care about such stuff. Conclusion:- Truly, the final nail in the coffin is when Thor gets enslaved by African-American female Valkyrie and gets his arse handed over by her all the time, she even kicks Loki's arse. If she is really that strong even stronger than Thor, then why just not make her the main protagonist? She just alone can go to Asgard and save everyone and call it a day and go back to her drinking habits by night. The worst part out of all just check ""Tessa Thompson""'s twitter and her blunt hate for men and how she does't care what Boys/Men thinks about her sexuality of her character in the movie even though it is mostly women who are asking her just to satisfy their ""curiosity""."
12 November 2017,good-decision,5,8,5,God of LIGHTENING and a game of spot the mistakes!,"This contains spoilers and some of the very visible and laughable mistakes you can see in the movie. First, it's not a bad watch if you're not really that much of a Thor fan. If you're a general superhero movie fan and under the age of 33-30 chances are you'll like it. But if you absolutely loved the comics, this movie will put you off American movies for quite some time. First, Thor is the god of LIGHTENING, thunder and storms, not the god of thunder alone. So it was retarded to see his enemies control him using a small electric chip that's about 120 volts (if that judging that it was used to control humans too), while the god of lightening can handle more than trillions of volts going through his body and eyes. Second, Thor is obviously a retard. He doesn't know that he's the god of lightening. He thought he lost his ability to act because he doesn't have a hammer any more only ttill his dead father reminded him. How many years did he practice his godliness again? In fact, Thor in this movie is weak, rash, stupid, good at begging, not the smartest cookie and has the charisma of teen. I'll flash my big arms and you be impressed, OK? Please? I feel sorry for Chris Hemsworth he's gonna be stranded in this stupid role for a long time. Third and last: They chop the beautiful blonde locks of Thor and give him a haircut that looks cheap, dark and stupid. I'm sorry but what's left of Hemsworth's head is so tiny and even more dwarfed by his massive torso. His head looks like a single lost cherry on top of a twelve tier wedding cake. Out of proportion and doesn't look right. -Tessa Thompson acts as if she spent her entire life watching cheerleader movies. Superficial, pouty, posey and faaaaaakkkkee. She's a very beautiful woman but boy is she effing boring! I laughed when the Asgardian army knelt to launch their weapons at Hela (or whatever reason they knelt for) then she introduced herself and commands them to kneel. They're already kneeling. Blindness runs in the family as this is not the only time this happens. Kate Blanchett has never looked better. I never thought of her as sexy till now. But the acting was lame in many parts. Anthony Hopkins... dear oh dear... this man has been acting as if he's epic bored of the whole industry. Can he just retire or hasn't sorted out his bills yet? He's my favourite actor by inertia.. I've been waiting for at least ten years to see him show us again what he's really capable of. Editing errors are rife. I'm an absent minded goof yet could easily spot them. The clear change in the shoulders of Hela's costume as she invaded the Bifrost for the first time, the erratic foot positioning of the zombie soldiers on the bifrost, the positioning dots (they look like laser pen beams) on the graves of a couple of soldiers as Hela throws the eternal flame, the wrong sequence of dry/sweaty arms and face on Thor's body as he kneels to take counsel if his dead father, greasy/curly hair changes Loki suddenly suffers from as he tricks Thor before decoding the spaceship, and many more. Generally the acting was horrendous, the dialog a disaster and the logic messed up. However, in an unprecedented event, the music is ten times better than the movie and it's why I gave this movie 5 out of ten. Otherwise, it would be 2 stars if that"
5 July 2021,assassington,9,17,9,Reasonably my favorite out of all the other Thor movies,"Thor was comedic, Hulk was oddly adorable and very Hulk-like (and perhaps even the last of what we see of ""The Hulk"", yk with what happens in Infinity War), Loki had pathed himself a redemption arc that didn't feel forced, given by the insights into the brothers' childhood times together (*ahem, the snake story haha*).Overall, jammed packed full of interesting stories, content, and two of my favorite Avengers- and Loki :D."
22 July 2021,ostlerb-02853,11,23,5,"Tried to mainstream the movie, failed miserably","I'm not sure if this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but Disney tried hard to make it one, and they failed miserably. Their attempts at humor make it hard to take anyone or anything seriously. Furthermore, it severely undermines the falling of Asgard, and it causes much of the film time to be wasted on cheesy lines that have no relevance to the story.If this were the first movie of the Thor franchise, okay then my review would be much more favorable. But this is the 3rd movie of the franchise (and the 6th movie of the MCU that Thor has appeared in). You can't just completely change characters' personalities once they have already been previously established. Everyone wasn't their usual selves. The Thor from all of the previous movies would not have taken the seize of Asgard as light-hearted as he did in this story.To make things even worse, the movie chose to play ""Immigrant Song"" during Asgard's last battle. Seriously?? This battle took place on Asgard, not Earth! A battle like this should be met with intense instrumental music, not contemporary music that comes from Earth.This shows that Disney was clearly trying mainstream the movie to all audiences and was willing to rip the movie of any genuine authenticity.Sadly, it actually worked. It was a box office hit. So congrats Disney. You successfully sold out Thor.Also, half the movie is a ripoff of Gladiator."
8 June 2021,maharousewagdi,7,13,9,It is one of the best movie of THOR Series,"Plagued by visions of Ragnarok -- that is, the death of the gods and the end of Asgard -- Thor (Chris Hemsworth) moves to avert the long-foretold disaster in THOR: RAGNAROK. After suffering a terrible personal loss, the son of Odin discovers life-changing truths about Asgard, his family, and the true threat. He finds he must escape captivity and recruit friends both new (Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie) and old (Mark Ruffalo as Hulk) for an epic confrontation against the most powerful forces he's ever faced (namely, Cate Blanchett as Hela, Goddess of Death).The Marvel Cinematic Universe's most audacious entry so far, Thor's third stand-alone movie goes there with wild, bold choices -- and it succeeds, epically, on many levels. Thor: Ragnarok is a triumphant unification of diverse MCU elements. It's as gonzo-funny as the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, it steps up the sci-fi from those and the Avengers entries, it expands on the best mythological threads of the previous Thor films, it introduces exciting sword-and-sorcery action, and it even allows for real, believable character growth. Director Taika Waititi and the screenwriters have realized that all these things exist simultaneously in this ever-expanding storytelling cosmos, and they embrace it all. Ragnarok has dragons and demons and the Goddess of Death, spaceships and lasers and wormholes, gladiatorial combat and revolution, and even some magic in the form of a Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) crossover. Not ony does Waititi stir these ingredients together with the aplomb of a mad-but-brilliant chef, but he boldly adds his own special sauce with his quirky humor and even the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" as a kind of new, perfectly chosen theme for Thor.We've seen hints of it before, but Ragnarok fully unlocks Hemsworth's Thor as a likable comic figure capable of personal growth. He's actually evolving into the great king he must become, while getting funnier with each appearance. The return of Ruffalo's Hulk is more than welcome -- so much so that the only complaint with the film's eye-popping action is there isn't enough of him in the final battle. Even Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, gets to have some fun doing his version of Odin-as-played-by-Loki. Among the newcomers, Thompson shines as the conflicted, swaggering, too-cool-for-Asgard Valkyrie (though her alcoholism-of-the-gods drinking problem isn't addressed at all by the film). The most lovable of the new characters is the gentle, blue rockpile-revolutionary warrior Korg, voiced winningly by Waititi. And as Hela, Blanchett kills it. Hela was co-created by one of the greatest comic artists of all time, Jack Kirby, and, unlike some superhero movies, Ragnarok dives deeply into Kirby's incredible designs. The two-time Oscar-winning actress achieves the full Kirby, chewing the scenery with razor-sharp fangs and eyes shining with malevolence while looking comic-panel perfect doing it. This isn't a perfect movie: The brightly lit, candy-colored cinematography and production design sometimes feel inappropriate. And major characters are killed and quickly forgotten. (Speaking of which, where's Sif?) But those are quibbles with a movie that, from its opening scene (easily the most thrilling in the MCU to date), incites a head-banging ""right on!"" Waititi, previously best known for small, personal comedies like What We Do in the Shadows and his work with Flight of the Conchords, passes his first big-canvas test with flying colors.It is one of the best movie of THOR Series."
4 November 2017,Evanescent_Angel,113,221,1,"I hated this movie completely, and it should have been a Guardians of the Galaxy movie instead.","Ugh, I really really hated this movie entirely. I was hoping for the heart of Wonder Woman or Lord of the Rings in Epic Quality, I got none of that. I honestly wanted to leave the theater, and mind you that is quite a feat to get me to not want to watch a film anymore. Last movie to hold this distinction of me wanting to leave the theater was that awful live action Scooby Doo movie. I was not wanting to see a comedy but an epic, Shakespearian Drama with realistic humor in small quantities in it like the first one was. I got none of that as well. The only thing I did like was Cate Blanchett as Hela. What bothered me the most was that people were getting killed and maimed by Hela but golly gee! Let's crack another childish joke!!!! Imagine if Game of Thrones was a juvenile comedy like this movie? Thank the Old Gods and the New that GOT is realistic in it's character portrayals. When all is said and done I am just not going to watch another Marvel movie in the theater again. I should have trusted my instinct and not gone like I did with Thor: The Dark World, but I stayed for my mother and that's all. If DC betrays me with Justice League I'm just swearing off modern comic movies altogether and just relying on all my old DVDs of the great Comic movies like the first 2 Raimi Spider-mans, Nolan's Batman movies and X2 to remind me when Comic Movies actually had heart, not the Chaching of the cash register. I felt like Ragnarok completely insulted my intelligence. I grew up with the Christoppher Reeves Superman, I still love the first two Raimi Spidey movies, and the first two X-Men movies as well as Nolan's Batman movies. All of these franchises had quality, intelligence and heart, not treated as a comedy to appeal to the stoner generation and their simple minds. Marvel has let me down and I refuse to waste my money and two hours of my life on unenjoyable experiences anymore so I refuse to go see another Marvel film in theaters.P.S. And here's the spoiler, can someone please tell me exactly why they unnecessarily made Hela Odin's daughter and not Loki's Daughter from the past as in the continuity that has been around for decades? Did they not think that people could wrap their heads around the fact that Loki, most likely in his moment of freedom from Asgard between Thor and Avengers, time traveled and impregnated Hela's mother in the past?"
27 October 2017,felipe-29424,59,107,9,"Fun, really fun","Thor is at his comedic best with a great cast and great directing. I loved all the subtle references to the origins of thor in the comics (eg, the umbrella Mjolnir, rune thor with one eye) as well as in norse mythology. Great research! Keeping it light is what it needed, as there are too many marvel movies with ""end of the world"" scenarios. Great fun!"

25 October 2017,svenwalbers,126,249,8,"It's fun, it's fast, it's not flawless","I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie, but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most Marvel movies, the villains don't marvel."
10 June 2022,juansantos_vb,2,2,5,Too much forced comedy,"I remember the first 2 movies when thor was a bratty ""soon king"" seeking for war. Little by little changed to be noble. The first movie lacks action and brothers touch..
The second was emotional, extremely exciting, best fights, serious moments, powerful and mighty scenes that thor created. And everyone participated in the movie.Both had ""NECESSARY COMEDY"" to lighten some scenes..This one is a Joke literally. I had such deception after watching the powerful and mighty THOR. Into a cheap clown.What a waste of using an ELITE actor as Anthony Hopkins. To be ridiculous (Loki disguised as Odin) and also only a few minutes to say goodbye. By the way worst scene. Probably no one felt the parenting feeling of a father to his sons.Also a great actress. To be a funny joke. She was supposed to be one of the worst enemies that thor might face and she wasn't threatening just sassy and bratty. She's beautiful but with the obvious CGI horns looked lame. I know the horns are part of the comic book but using them one time might do the trick. Not all the time.Heimdall appeared just 10 minutes just to do very extra things.Loki the LITERALLY GOD OF MAGIC and mischief. Probably more than 100 years old. It's treated like a fool against doctor strange a rookie on magic. Lame sceneThe fight of Thor against Hulk supposed to be legendary (like ironman and cap America) but only a few punches and it was more haha hehe scenes. Probably more jokes than fight.The executioner is a very very but really very extra character in the movie. He just did 2 things and that's it. But hey. He did more than heimdall.Very american jokes. Lame.Uneccesary jokes. Comedy every 5 minutes."
4 November 2017,v-chowdhrie,562,1134,1,Murder of character,"If the movie can't be serious about an apocalypse and just goofs around in nearly every scene then its certainly the murder of Thor as we have seen in comics. One cannot emotionally connect to absolutely anything, death of Odin or Thor losing an eye or destruction of Mjolnir or extinction of Aasgard as we know it. Movie is perfect example of killing the plot with over use of humor, jokes is on us."
18 November 2017,rjphilip86,105,207,1,Awful just plain awful...wanted to walk out,For the life of me i cannot understand how every Marvel flick just hits it off with the critics just because of the lame one liners and forced jokes. If thats what you look for in a movie then you should watch a Jim Carrey flick from the 90's which would be way better. I just sat there wondering when the movie would get even a bit serious. I mean the protagonist loses some very close people to him and his whole world but hey instead of showing some emotion why not just throw in some more lame one liners and jokes. I could hear crickets in the cinema. The few people who laughed were forcing themselves i think lol. It was utter garbage. On the other hand Justice league even though it had its faults was pure awesome. At least they got the characters right instead of the more joke better review formula Marvel has adopted. Thor is not even close to its source comic material. And don't get me started on the awful CGI. Don't waste your money....
6 November 2017,gregeichelberger,7,16,7,Mixed mythology: 'Thor 3' soars,"While not reaching the cerebral heights (at least in THIS genre) offered by Kenneth Branagh's first installment of the Marvel Studios study of the God of Thunder, 2011's ""Thor,"" this third version (the less written about Alan Taylor's ""Dark World,"" the better) is certainly a wild, fun ride and a worthy edition to the sub franchise.Directed by Taika Waititi (""Boy,"" ""Hunt For the Winter People""), this project features the parental and sibling angst so prominently displayed in the last two films and continues as Thor (Chris Hemsworth, the horrid remakes of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Vacation"") the natural son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins, ""Transformers: The Last Knight"") battles his rebellious adopted bro, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""Kong: Skull Island""), only this time there's a twist.It's as Darth Vader once said, ""So, you have a SISTER,"" and the two are soon informed that upon Odin's death (the franchise's second or third, so far), the daughter, Hela (multi-Golden Globe winner Cate Blanchett, ""Manifesto"") — born first — is baaaaack and, by the way, just happens to be the Goddess of Death, for whatever THAT designation is worth (remember Aries in ""Wonder Woman""?).Her arrival in the mythical kingdom of Asgard ushers in the Ragnarok (Korangar spelled backwards), which we suppose means, literally hell on earth (or in Asgard, anyway), which necessitates the feuding brothers join forces to take on Hela and her minion army of long-dead soldiers (yes, yes, we know, just like the good guys in ""Lord Of the Rings: Return Of the King,"" as well as ""The Mummy 3: The Emperor's Tomb"" had to deal with).Here, though, the sons of Odin are aided in this quest by stock Marvel characters Bruce Bannon/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, ""Now You See Me 2"") and Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), along with a dull and drunken Valkyrie (or Amazon) warrior, Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") and a host of revolting peasants (take that anyway you want to).Of course, we know demise and destruction will follow, but even invincible deities are vulnerable in films like this and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is no exception. Also expect the fire, fights, explosions and other Marvel pyrotechnics and terrific action sequences so prominent in these efforts, as well.What many viewers may NOT expect, however, is just how humorous and witty this vehicle happens to be. The inclusion of Jeff Goldblume (""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"") as a planet's smarmy ""Grandmaster,"" who runs that world's gladiator contest that features the duel between Thor and Hulk, along with a lot of lively word play and real comedy obviously inspired by ""Deadpool"" and the ""Guardians Of the Galaxy"" series.There is also a hilarious send up of the series with Matt Damon (the upcoming ""Downsizing""), Sam Neill (""Jurassic Park"") and Luke Hemsworth (""Westworld"" TV series).Still, no Marvel film would be complete without the amazing special effects, here directed by Brian Cox (""Gold,"" ""Silence"") and fantastic art direction (Bill Booth, ""Kong: Skull Island"").Chris Hemsworth was obviously born for this role, even though his acting talent often struggles to keep up with his powerful hammer (though here he acquits himself rather well), while Hiddleston is a much better thespian and a delightful (if extremely incompetent) villain, but in ""Ragnarok,"" it's really Blanchett who steals everything complete with a slimming black leather suit and jet black hair that turns into antlers.Now THAT'S frightening"
29 October 2017,rickardptlarsson,17,33,7,Good but not great,"Enjoyable movie, I want to start with that.The story is simple and predictable but it works. You don't go to these kind of films for the intricate plots.The action is great and the cgi is mostly awesome! Unfortunately some characters are below the standard we all have come to expect, especially the directors own character Krog. I don't know what happened there at all.But the cgi isn't my biggest concern, it's the humor. I laughed and enjoyed the movie but it was very distracting because it never stopped. So many cheap laughs, it was almost like a spoof more than the real thing. I got the feeling from the clip on Youtube of ""Team Thor"".The characters lack depth because of all the humor and I feel like Marvel are redirecting its movies to fit a younger audience. I feel like the volume of comic relief is what keeps this film from being a great one, just like Guardians Vol.2.The movie is enjoyable, bright, fun, colorful and with an awesome soundtrack. If you like that kind of movie this is the one for you! I miss Thor and Hulk/Banner from the other movies and would have liked to have had a movie with those characters instead of these comedic versions."
1 June 2021,pegasus-67050,7,14,6,Decent and varied,Nothing will beat the first Thor movie for me but this more lighthearted take on the third instalment is refreshing. I don't hate The Dark World but I don't particularly like it either. Loki was definitely the best part of that film hands DOWN! He's cool as sidekick here but it's great to see Thor have a relatively good time (along with the rest of the cast and characters). Hela is an awesome villain who shouldn't have been killed off so soon but all-in-all it's a fun movie. Bruce was cool. But I HATE the freaking HULK! Definitely refreshing before the darker tone of Infinity War!

                        ",A Watered Down Husk,"I really don't want to hate this movie.First of all, the characters personalities have been neutered, to the point where they're basically bad joke/self referential one liner vending machines.And I hate to use an overused joke considering the movie I'm reviewing, but...Take a shot of alcohol every time there's a joke that doesn't add to the plot or characters, try and make it through the first half, in fact, forget that, try and make through the first fifteen minutes, you'll be very drunk.Also, for a movie with such a colourful poster, why does the movie itself look so dull? Asgard in the first two movies looked so grand, and shiny.In this movie, while there's technically more colour, it feels more flat.It's like the cinematographer turned the brightness up to the absolute maximum, and the contrast down to the absolute minimum so instead of the colours standing out, the picture looks mostly white and grey.One of the more stranger things I felt with this movie, is that it feels like the filmmakers hate all the characters, except for maybe Heimdall.Thor and Loki are constantly falling over, getting hit in the head, and getting electrocuted, which in Thor's case doesn't make sense, since he can shoot lightening at the end.Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun are just killed off in their first scenes, and Thor doesn't even react or find out.Sif isn't even mentioned in this movie.Hela's the villain, so yeah I'm not surprised there.Valkyrie is just an alcoholic who kidnaps people for money, and yeah that's about all there is to her character, yeah the villain killed her wife but at the end when she's fighting Hela, she doesn't say, ""That was for my lover"" or anything related to that, that little bit of back story just felt pointless.Skurge, he basically has no character, he's just fed info by Hela, turns good again at the end, then dies.Bruce Banner, he's just here so the producers could put The Hulk on all the posters and in all of the trailers, other then that, he doesn't have a character ark, he just falls over a lot, gets hit in the head a bunch, and he says unfunny one liners, basically the same as Thor and Loki.And finally Odin, what really surprised me with this specifically, is how the writers added a bunch of backstory to Odin's character, to just ignore it.Basically Odin and Hela went around conquering and committing genocide on different worlds.You'd think being Odin's son, Thor might have some sort of emotional response to this, but just like with Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, he doesn't even find out, so it's just as useless.And last of all here's a question I bet even people who like this movie can't answer, What is the theme/message of this movie?Because I can name the themes/messages for the first two movies just fine.The theme/message for Thor (2011) ""Killing people just for disagreeing with you, only creates enemies""The theme/message for Thor The Dark World ""Forcing your people to give up their lives for their land is no less brutal then mass genocide""The theme/message for Thor Ragnarok, after weeks of thinking ""Forcing people, to do things against their will is fine, as long it's the good guys who are forcing them""
It's a shame when a series starts off by simply being, and doing its own thing.But then the producers start listening to the people who weren't even fans to begin with, and they turn it into an obnoxious, cynical, condescending, self parody, that I didn't walk out on, because I still like the MCU."
5 May 2021,ekcst,6,8,7,Haha!,"Really interesting, Thor and Hulk was funny and bullying Loki. But it was enjoyable to watch!"
30 April 2020,a-78738,4,7,7,Marvel is real,"What does this film feel like? Having lost thor's hammer, he has to learn, not just by relying on it, but by finding new sources of strength. In the face of the biggest subjugation in life, the discussion of destruction and rebirth and the redefinition of the people and the country are the focus of the film. It's all about the fun and the glam, and according to the comics, ragnarok, thor's hammer, and thor's eyes and powers all have a lot of plot."
4 February 2018,greenwhich,9,21,1,Guardins from a stupid galaxy and it's not Thor's,"15 whole minutes I watched this sitcom for, 15 minutes, and it was enough to put anybody off the 'superpants' genre for life. (An ego they aren't clowns in diapers, but are providing an alternative role models). It was a bad as watching musical stupid heroes. They might as well have sung themselves into Valhalla. No it was worse, they told really stupid fart jokes almost every time they spoke, while flicking 'snot' at the screen, (CGI goop grunting) upon using posh English accents. And in utter disdain I have boycotted Thor and these stupid heroes from memory. Don't bother. You will probably find it worst, because if it was that bad, the source material has vanished. Like in those 15 Surtur was seemingly slain, maybe it was parody. Yawn"
27 October 2017,purple66,64,123,5,Many things frustrated me,"This isn't really a review per se, I just needed somewhere to get things off my chest about this movie.So here's a list of things that bothered me:One thing I love about the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe is the continuity. Most movie franchises are fairly relaxed on continuity (which I am very opposed to), or in some cases blatantly disregard it (Fox's X-Men franchise, for example), so it's really nice to have a big franchise where everything little thing adds up. However, unless I'm missing something, Ragnarok screws that up.In The last Thor movie, The Dark World, it is stated that Asgardians live for roughly 5,000 years. This is later corroborated when we learn the convergence of the nine realms (seemingly coincidentally) also happens every 5,000 years, and Odin's father, Bor (then King of Asgard), was the one who dealt with Malekith at the previous convergence (therefore, implying that Odin had either not been born at this point, or was a baby / young child).Yet in Ragnarok, the history revealed between Odin and Hela suggests Odin has been around a lot longer than that, even that he may have been the first Asgardian, but from The Dark World, we know he had a father (Bor) and a grandfather (Buri). And in the first scene of Ragnarok, Thor says he thought his father killed Surtur the Fire Giant ""half a million years ago"". This just doesn't add up.The huge cliffhanger at the end of The Dark World, Loki secretly being on the throne of Asgard, disguised as Odin, is simply disregarded, thrown away as a joke. People had been waiting for the pay-off from that cliffhanger for four years, and it's just wasted.The Warriors Three, Thor's closest friends, are all killed off nonchalantly, and there is no recognition of that whatsoever from Thor. His three closest friends all killed, nothing.Where is Lady Sif? She isn't mentioned once. No concern from Thor, it's like she doesn't exist.Supporting characters from the previous Thor movies are disregarded, no mention of them, bar Jane, who is written out with two lines of dialogue explaining her and Thor broke-up. Again, played for laughs. It renders the relationship between them built up in previous movies pointless.It ruins one of The Dark World's few good scenes. Loki's sacrifice. Completely makes a mockery of it, now it will never be able to be taken seriously by anyone watching The Dark World again.The previous points show this movie is disrespectful of what came before it and the work others had put into the franchise.Loki is wasted, nothing interesting happens with his character this time around, he's just there for laughs, like everyone else in this movie. Bear in mind he is a fan-favorite who hasn't been seen on- screen in four years.Doctor Strange's role in the movie doesn't feel natural at all, it's very out of place, and somewhat jarring. It isn't even a cameo really, it's blatant product placement for his movie. They're hoping people who skipped Doctor Strange will pick it up on Blu-ray / DVD after seeing his scene in Thor: Ragnarok.With Mjölnir seemingly permanently destroyed (There would be no reason to bring it back, as Thor would have no need for it now anyway, seeing as it was revealed it simply helped him wield his power, rather than provide it), does that mean we won't get the long fantasied (and teased in Avengers: Age of Ultron) scene of Captain America triumphantly lifting it in a future Avengers movie?The attempted humor in the opening scene makes me cringe. Half of the gags after that are just people falling over or being knocked over by something, as if it's written by Miranda Hart. Without Jeff Goldblum or the character Korg, the humor in this movie would be painful.There is no sense of threat or weight to anything that happens because of the relentlessly slapstick tone. You just don't care about any of it. If the characters don't take their situation seriously, why should the audience care?The entire population of Asgard seems to be less than a hundred people. Honestly, I think I must be missing something here, it was bizarre.Iron Man Three was originally meant to have an alcoholism subplot, which presumably would have been dealt with in a serious manner, yet Disney shot it down and so it didn't make it past the first draft of the script, presumably because they didn't think it would be suitable for children. Yet, here, in Thor: Ragnarok, Valkyrie is very openly and repeatedly shown with her own alcohol problem, yet in this movie Valkyrie's alcoholism is played for laughs (as is everything else). Surely that's worse? Treating alcoholism as a joke, rather than portraying it in a serious manner in Iron Man Three. Which would you rather your children see alcoholism portrayed as? I don't understand the thinking here.So there you have it, that's what bugged me. Is it a fun movie? Sure, a few moments that will make you smirk here and there, and some colorful action scenes, it's entertaining, but for me, that's not worth all those issues I mentioned. Maybe I'd feel differently if it had a good story or an interesting villain, but there's just nothing of substance to it."
29 October 2017,Prichards12345,8,21,7,Fun and enjoyable but shallow,"Have to say right away that this was good. The third solo outing for Thor sees him stranded on an alien planet and forced to fight in a contest of champions organised by The Grand Master (Jeff Goldblum - kooky and funny as ever). With Asgard in danger of being conquered by his older sister Hela, the Goddess of Death (Cate Blanchett), Thor must find a way to escape and rescue his fellow Asgardians. This might prove a bit difficult as his opponent in his first contest is....The Incredible Hulk.I've skipped a lot of plot here to avoid too many spoilers. Quite frankly the story is all over the place, being mainly an excuse for a string of jokes and wise-cracking. Some of these don't work, but most do. Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Thor, and he's well supported by the usual suspects. No Lady Sif, though. No mention of her at all.Standouts for me were Goldblum and Tessa Thompson, who adds a bit of spice as a drunken ex-Valkyrie. Blanchett is a very good villain, but somewhat underused. Still better than Malekith any day, though.Basically Marvel have delivered three out and out comedies this year. Hopefully Black Panther and Infinity War will restore some semblance of depth, as the movie is very shallow. This does have some serious plot points, but it's glossed over in favour of the next one-liner.Sleek, entertaining; check your brain in. Now it's time for Marvel to get serious."
4 November 2017,janiecedesmond-380-213809,106,213,2,Don't waste money,"When you expect Thor and you get Chris Comedy Hour Staring Chris Cringeworth I mean Hemsworth, you start losing faith in Marvel. Besides having to deal with Thor being a complete moron, and I didn't think he could become worse, they surprise me and make him even more of a dull character. Then make Hulk talk! So DUMB!!!! I had hoped for something more deeper than the over the top campy costumes, the cheesy one liners and the God awful dialogue with no plot and practically no real villain, I mean they wasted Hela and she could have been so much more, then they go and add a huge rock that sounds like its sucking helium and goofy chars that make Jar Jar Binks look better! Its so campy and edited so badly. Geez I cannot tell you how much this movie sucked! Oh, I use to love that Led Zep song...now they just over killed it in this movie..lousy costumes, lousy dialogue, terrible editing and horrible movie score. Yeah. WTG Marvel on making the worst Thor ever! I am switching to DC"
26 October 2017,fikrimatsukaze,51,90,8,Best action movie ever with combination of comedy,"Honestly i LOVED IT!!! The action and comedy combination is truly fantastic. Thanks to Taika for the formula of this movie. The first Thor and the second is slightly disappointed but with this third movie, i must said civil war beaten by this movie.Hela is scary villain ever. I loved her. Many villain in MCU, she is the best of the all. But poor Skurge, he had potential but you know if you watch this movie.I cannot waiting for infinity war, MCU is the best all of it."
18 February 2021,rscott25,8,15,9,A bit different from the prior Thor movies..,"More light hearted, fun nonetheless. A good movie overall. Worth seeing for sure if you have not followed the whole MCU arc.Not sure for you young ones, but the fight song at the end, while definitely a pumped up song...listen to the lyrics, the song is The Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, which is what was actually happening, they were in the midst of becoming immigrants to a new land. So appropriate in meaning."
5 November 2017,george.schmidt,6,17,9,And cue Led Zeppelin! The best of the THOR films!,"THOR: RAGNAROK (2017) ***1/2 Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Hopkins, Benedict Bumbercatch, Taika Waititi, Luke Hemsworth, Sam Neill, (Voice of Clancy Brown) (Cameo: Stan Lee) Fun and fast-paced Marvel Universe thread with Thor facing down his long-lost, yet beyond evil, sister Hela (formidable Blanchett) in her hell-bent vengeance seeking and destroying their home planet of Asgard while being imprisoned as a reluctant gladiator versus of all people/things - Dr. Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk. Director Waititi (who co-stars in motion capture CGI as an alien compadre) shrewdly turns the hero upside down and smartly relying on much needed humor and light-hearted endeavors layering the dark proceedings at hand. Laced with biting wit thanks to a well-tempered screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost allowing Hemsworth to stretch his comedic skills (deadpan lethal and with aplomb) while also allowing secondary (and new) characters to shine including Hiddleston as the arch half-brother Loki up to his usual antics and back stabbings (but less lethal this time) and a truly hilarious interplay ala Hope and Crosby with Ruffalo as an equally unruffled Banner trying to keep up with the plot. Enjoy!"
6 November 2017,paraguaijin,10,18,8,best Asgardians of the Galaxy movie ever,"Thanks to this movie I noticed fantasy films are limited by Earth. Everything about Earth has to be ""realistic"" and muddied, and Thor's first movies were no exception. Now that Thor left the Earth behind the movie finally has freedom to paint everything in screaming bright neon and pastel colors, which is how I love fantasy. I'm tired of muddied and dirty in fantasy, and Thor:Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy don't have it.But that's not the only similarity with GotG. Th:R is basically a buddy movie about a bunch of misfits forming a heroic team too. And the quips and slapstick are all over the place like in GotG. Even the Hulk gets a go at it.Speaking of whom, all the known characters show great growth, starting with the obvious: Hulk now talks (and behaves) like a 4 year old kid. He's able to socialize (and have great chemistry) with the rest of the cast. Thor also shows that he's been catching up to his adoptive brother's cunning and sleight-of-hand traits, a change that started in Thor:The Dark World. And Loki does more nice things for others, as shown in that sequel as well. If you heard the director Waititi saying that he's breaking up with the other movies and creating his own thing, rest assured: it all feels like a natural evolution and closure, not a hard reset.So why I don't give this film a bigger rating? First of all, because there's a particular outdoor scene where the 3D pictures misaligned and hurt my eyes. Not sure who's at fault for that, but that scene was an obvious rushed product and I could tell. Second because, just like with GotG, there isn't a single part that sticks in my mind after coming out of the theater: all i can remember are the psychedelic colors. I can't evoke a piece of dialogue that moved me or an important part of the plot that impressed me: it all amounted to quips and interruption of sad moments by more quips.I don't feel that I ""had to disconnect my brain to enjoy it"" though. I just feel blown away by the visuals, which are a far more stronger point than the plot. The plot itself isn't bad: it's just unremarkable, merely functional like the white frames in a comic page. The film feels like a dizzying roller-coaster ride in which you're thrown images and actions in front and the pathos and motives are just blurs to the sides of your seat. SO! If you're a sad sob that hates roller-coaster rides and can't appreciate bright colors and screamed ""waah where's the realism waah waah"" after GotG Vol.1 and 2, I don't recommend this movie for you. And don't read any comics as well, you won't like them. As a matter of fact, who forcing you to watch Marvel? Beautiful images and witticisms are on par for the course."
26 October 2017,stevenrotherforth,7,18,7,Will you be careful where you're swinging that thing,"Thor RagnarokFor me the first two solo outings of the guy with the 80's hair and big hammer were average at best. Thor's turn in the two Avengers movies was much better, but his ability to carry a movie by himself seemed too heavy for those ridiculously large biceps of his. Not that this was anything to do with Chris Hemsworth's performance. Certainly not, it was more to do with the blandness of the actual character.In this third solo movie the creators have gone to town. This is a full blown comedy first, superhero movie second, and for the most part it works well. The storyline is pretty much painting by numbers superhero stuff but it's the way it's delivered that makes this movie such an enjoyable experience. Hemsworth is allowed to exercise his comedic chops and many of the improvised scenes work to side splitting effect. An equally funny supporting cast all seem to be having a good time. Cate Blanchett brings a level of sophistication to her sexy villainous role and Jeff Goldblum lights up the screen at every opportunity.The hulk has never looked better. Far gone are the days of early CGI Hulk when he looked like a cartoon superimposed onto screen. He is given a bit of depth here instead of just being the big green angry guy that smashes the snot out of everyone. Still, he does do quite a lot of snot smashing, but hey, it wouldn't be the hulk otherwise. Karl Urban does a cockney accent, at least I think that's what it was and Idris Elba shows up. Most likely to honour his contract. His appearance is welcome though as he's cool in everything he appears in.I haven't gone in to too much about the plot as to be honest I can't remember what the hell this was all about. I just know I had a good time and by the looks of it everyone involved did so too."
24 October 2017,GlenGDN,42,92,5,Don't except the Thor character of previous films!,"The film is well made, good CGI, and it is very entertaining....lots of action and humour. However, the plot is very basic, it is very predictable, and lacks tension and emotional engagement (probably due to the almost constant humorous dialogue and gags). My biggest concern is that the humour has gone too far, to the extent that the characters bear very little resemblance to previous films. If you're just after a entertaining film, with good humour and action, this should work for you. If you want the Marvel world that you've seen in previous films, with Thor and Hulk in character, then this isn't it. A formula that's working with Guardians and Deadpool, doesn't have to be imposed in characters in this franchise, there was enough humour in the previous films, but this goes too far in my opinion, as I was hoping to see the same characters as in the previous films."
12 November 2017,dinduva,38,70,1,"I thought guardians of the galaxy sucked, but it was nothing compared to this garbage","For starters the movie had a million plot holes, all the characters acted like they were mentally ill. Thors friends all died and no one even mention anything about it, not even a one second pause? The Hulk was a joke and Loki acted like a puss the whole movie (From a smart psycho that everyone was afraid of to a stupid puss who did nothing the whole movie). And what about those buttons that stunned them, why not put one of those on Hela?WHAT WAS THIS MOVIE?!"
19 October 2017,ufukleman,128,247,10,I am broke,"I ve heard good things about Logan,spider man hc,guardians 2.And they all turned out pretty good for me in different ways.Logan is the first hero movie that made me cry.Yondu's death had a huge emotional impact on me(even more than superman's death in BvS).That huge twist about vulture being Liz's.And now this spectacular Thor movie.I am broke now,thanks to you marvel:).After this movie,the hulk grew on me so much.Finally they gave him some personality.Loki,Hela both were pretty good.Easter eggs were surprising.Both funny and emotional at the same time.They showed the devastating events in Ragnarok pretty well.You should definitely watch this movie in 3D,visuals were also amazing"
27 October 2017,ali-rehman_1990,69,130,10,"Satisfaction, Joy and great night sleep.","I watched this movie on second biggest screen in the country (vue print works Manchester) on release the day and boy i was glad.Thor Ragnarok not only takes you to the most fun and entertaining ride in Thor franchise but its on par with The Avengers in that aspect.It is a visual spectacle with its amazing colours and some of the scenes will make you feel privileged been born at this age of time.Its story is derived from few comics and is really narrated perfectly with the right pushes at right times.Hela is played perfectly by Cate Blanchett. I really enjoyed her delivery with tone she used it was perfect.Hemsworth as Thor was awesome and so was Mark Raffulo as hulk and Hiddlstone as Loki, all the other side characters did a good job but the icing on this cake was Taika Waititi as Korg, was hilarious.I had this feeling to compare this to rest of the top top superhero movies and Nolan's batman trilogy comes to mind.I would put it this way if you are not a Christopher Nolan and make movies like batman into crime dramas by which i mean giving them a serious look weather the world is ending or not you can be Taika Waititi and make them as much fun and entertaining as Thor Ragnork. Its Entertainment galore go treat yourself."

THOR help destroying ASGARD!!Thanks marvel for ruining Thor.."
1 November 2017,siliconmind-61023,53,97,10,incredibly fun to watch,"Marvel did it again! The best thing about Marvel movies:I know what to expect and I get what I expected. Thor Ragnarok is just 2 hours of fun. The plot may be simple, the characters may be undeveloped, but I didn't go into the cinema for a Oscar best picture nominee. The constant jokes, the beautiful visual effects, the amazing soundtrack, even better than the Guardians I think, are just the things I paid for. Totally worth the money and the time. And spoiler alert, some may wonder how the fire monster beats Hela but Thor beats him at the beginning of the movie. My theory is that the fire monster is brought back by the eternal fire at the end, so it makes him much bigger, hence maybe more powerful.Anyway, one of Marvel's best movies, the very definition of entertainment, I will see it in cinema again."
25 October 2017,imabikerboy,67,134,2,"Bad Moves, Marvel.","As a fan of Thor, and Nordic Mythology, I'm pretty f***ed up. Yea, the CGI was powerful, thanks for that. But for the story? Cheesy And Too Shallow for a Nordic God Story. Please Marvel, put your jokes at the right place. For some entity like humans, let's said Spider-Man, Dead-Pool, it's okay for a full movies with jokes, it's natural, because they're human, they are average. But this? You just ruined all the Thor's character you build for many years. I was hoping for a cool CGI with cool story and cool fight, cause it's about Asgard, not a New Yorker boy who meet crazy rich genius. Once again, please, put your jokes with right portion and right place. You definitely fail on this. Too cheesy. This was my biggest disappointment as Marvel fans for as long as I can remember. You killed his attitude, you definitely killed Thor. You killed my fantasies since I was a child. I'm okay if you put all your very cheesy shallow jokes to those human characters. But this? Guardians of 9 realms? Like what? Like What are you guys thinking? It's just like you want to tell us that all of our lives is just a jokes like what they did?You totally cool for makes me out of this world with Ego Jokes at Guardians Of Galaxy, it hits me so hard like we're just nothing. But once again? Like really? Is that all of you want to tell us? Is that the hidden message? Well played dude.You put a comedy on a wrong place. And I was like definitely can know each and every step of your cheesy shallow jokes. Every single thing. It was not entertaining anymore. Too much and not a smart move, I never thought marvel would be as shallow as this. So shallow. Way more Shallow than The 40 Year Old Virgin or American Pie.You guys makes me bored. And if you keeping something like this for infinite wars, Please, just turn all of your smart cool brain into comedy shows. Makes a new production house, you definitely good at it. But please, Don't put any single superhero on it. I begging you.You missed to build all the mood of this story, even the super prankster Deadpool still have it's touchy feelings. For this? Zero. Minus.I put the ratings only for CGI, which doesn't amaze me since I've seen something like that at the guardians of galaxy. I expected more.And yeah, why You Chris Hemsworth? Why you killed your own figure? You're not like Tom Hiddlestone who still can manage his own figure, Loki, he's still have characters. Even thou it's turn into comedy movie, he's keeping his own pride characters. And yeah Benedict, he played so well to keep the Dr Strange as a character, even it's (again and again) a comedy movie. But he still have it's character as a keeper. Stronger beings. And so for Mark Ruffalo, who keep the hulk character. It's cool how he keep confused become a human again. They're well played. But you Chris? You makes me so disappointed... is that really how a God Characters looks like? No charisma at all? More weak and not smarter than a human? Oh please.. or this is your hidden agenda? It's beyond dude~~~Welcome To Stan Lee Comedy Show with big budget and cool CGI only to trolling you and makes a die hard fans got away from you. You can keep all those cheesy shallow fans to get along you with this Deadpool Pattern With Guardians Of Galaxy CGI thingy. But not me. Surprised me next time, OK?"
21 December 2019,Leofwine_draca,11,42,8,One of Marvel's best,"I've been working my way through the Marvel Cinematic Universe films lately and THOR: RAGNAROK marks a pleasing change from the norm (the last two I saw, BLACK PANTHER and SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, were both average and I'd hoped for more). This is more like the tone of the original GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (and much better than the disappointing sequel), i.e. it manages to tell a good adventure story while being very funny and quirky at the same time.The expansive Thor mythology and backdrop has kicked up a gear, so that all of the characters return for a faster and funnier tale. I liked the idea of the prison planet ruled by a perfect Jeff Goldblum, and of course there's all the action you can hope for. However, the character beats are where this film really works: Chris Hemsworth has never been warmer, more human, or funnier, and Mark Ruffalo shines in a smaller role. Things build to the typical OTT climax which manages to work this time around by focusing on the individuals throughout, and the end result is one of the most likeable Marvel pictures yet. Bring on the next!"
16 February 2018,psychedelicvoice,6,12,5,It's decent.,"I get the hype that has come with the new superhero movies. This is a good movie, don't get me wrong.
But where the Avengers/captain america are great, well this falls a bit short.Too much joking around. I like the style of it. But still. Tune down the obvious corny jokes. It's a bit like the disaster with Tobey Macquire with Spiderman."
5 November 2017,SirAdon,12,21,4,what i expected (thats not a good thing),"Do not go to this looking for any story from the comic arcs that this is sort of based on. I mean that would be to easy for them I guess, story was already written and they were good. Should have been two separate movies one for hulk and one for thor. Always seems they want to give hulk the crap treatment, make him weak, lose to people he can easily beat, make him sound extra dumb. Planet hulk has already been done in comic and animated form, follow that. Thor's ragnarok story has been done as well and needed to be taking more seriously. I recommend skipping this, read some comics or watch planet hulk animated movie or both. Either is better."
30 October 2017,marius_baciu86,91,179,1,Where is Marvel heading to?,"The movie was a big disappointment, looked like it was only constructed for the jokes (some good, some not that). Big plot holes like Sif not even being mentioned, or favorite secondaries like Volstagg and Fandral being discarded in an unworthy fashion. Why is Hogun leading the Asgard army when he was disbanded by Thor in the second movie to remain in his home-world? Why is Heimdall suddenly a traitor to the crown? Why does Odin pass away (as expected) so seamlessly and without a worthy scene like Frigga's? Oh, i get it, all of this was done to be unpredictable, right?Well... leaving aside that if you carefully watch the trailer, you know the entire movie in advance, the movie was very predictable. Big thumbs down Marvel for setting this tone, and an even bigger thumbs down to all those publication who call Thor 3 a work of awesomeness filled awesome art. I gave it a 1, because there are more than 10 marvel movies out there, and this was the worst of them."

This movie is perhaps, the WORST Marvel movie I have ever seen.Poor story-telling, weak character development, scenes felt out of place and total 360 from what Thor is supposed to have been.Hollywood blockbusters have been lowering the complexity of its stories to get more butts into the movie seats which include kids who might not be able to understand a more dark, realistic and complex story. This comes at the expense of adult audience who like to see a characters inits true form.This movie is basically Logan in reverse. It is a total betrayal of the character's true nature. The following are the movie sins committed in this flick; Warning Spoilers ahead!1) Bad Story-line.. This story doesn't allow characters to evolve or grow, a lot of the acting seems too familiar or forced for the sake of moving the movie forward or getting a reaction out of you.2) Everything happens so fast without explanation of events or relationships... a) Why did thor figure out that Loki was impersonating Odin now and not before? b) How was the all-powerful Odin enchanted by Loki? c) Why did Odin decide to let Hela to Invade Asgard and why did he decide to disappear? d) How did Hela break Thor's hammer? e) Why did the leader of Sakaar favorite Hulk over Thor?2) No setup from previous events and no purpose for charactersa) Thor and Hulk somehow ended up on the same planet by accident b) Why did Dr. Strange need to be in this movie besides setting up for a thor-strange relationship in a future Marvel movie? c) Why didn't Odin hint in previous films that thor had an evil sister named Hela? 3) Bad actingEven Tom Hiddlesto was off point, he had the usual devious smirk on his face but I sometimes wondered if he was expressing contempt at the directors of the film. Besides being a remarkable film crew with amazing actors, somehow this movie manages to bring out the worst acting of these stars.Heres a basic breakdown of each character Thor: A more emotional, funny and light-hearted ThorLoki: The same devious mischief with no new tricks up his sleeve, Loki is so predictable that even Thor has figured him out.Hela: The sorority club's biggest drama-queen, nothing mysterious or godlike about her. Even she falls into the joke frame.Heimdall: He had some good scenes and had a nice mystical look to him but wasn't very much useful in the movie.Grandmaster: This guy is supposed to be a ruler of a planet, instead he belongs on a SNL skit.Valkyrie: Independent strong woman, alcoholic, with both middle fingers up in your face. Somehow this quickly triggered ghetto character manages to defeat Loki in a battle for the sake of showing how women are strong too?Skurge: He betrayed Asgard for the whole movie and then tries to make up for it in less then 5 frames before he dies.Bruce Banner / Hulk: Even hulk manages to turn himself into a comedian.Doctor Strange: Earth's best sorcerer tools Asgardian gods such as Thor and Loki who should have far greater knowledge of magick then Dr. Strange.The Executioner: somehow managed to betray Asgard by serving Hela for the entire film, but then sacrifices himself at the end and we're expected to sympathize with this guy?Korg: This was a loony toons version of KorgTo seal the cherry on the cake, Thor basically lets and assists Asguard to be blown up to pieces, because he figures it will destroy Hela, someone who he wasn't able to defeat even with his new powers.The disappointment I felt after watching it sure caused a big disconnect for me after I came back home only to read all the positive reviews written by Critics and users alike, which made me question if these Critics are insiders, and if the users are in fact real accounts...I know everybody's got to make some money... but at what expense?"
23 March 2021,hxehjnyeh,7,10,10,One of the best mcu movies.,"I mean it's a good balance between comedy and seriousness.Dramatic scenes, comedy scenes, Jeff mf'ing goldblum even side characters were good Korg, grandmasters helper and hulk. Hulk got a fun spin and a very well placed roll in the movie, Mark acted really wel. Overall it's a good story and original take on a Thor movie."
23 November 2017,sonicoi,12,19,5,Probably the worst marvel movie,"While I was watching, I was thinking that it was a fan made movie.First, the comedy, the movie has many jokes, but they are stupid jokes, i didn't laugh once during the movie, different of spider-man homecoming which was hilarious.Thor in this movie is very strange, making dumb jokes, Loki too. Himdall substitute is horrible too, the Doctor Strange apparition was good, but too fast and confuse. Odin's death was strange too, with Thor blaming Loki. The planet hulk's lord was horrible, his warriors too, and the drunk Valkyrie was also very bad. Hulk was talking too much, no explanation for why he was losing to Thor or why he did not transform back into Bruce before. Bruce Benner was very strange in this movie, very strange ... There are dirty jokes in the movie, horrible jokes with the orgy spaceship and the Demon Anus."
18 December 2020,mariaq-96958,12,24,1,"I pause the movie too pee, and I forgot for 35 minutes that i was watching it!","Let me start by saying that Thor has always been my favourite character in marvel, but not anymore!!
I am from Denmark where Norse mythology was our religion once. And I am in chok!!
Everything is wrong!! Hela is LOKIS daughter, and the fenris wolf is LOKIS son - not his older long lost sister and her pet dog?
And Thor's hammer gets destroyed like it was a lollypop?
You killed a character, cut his hair and gave him a gun, and put in the worst music ever? Not a god anymore.
Thanks marvel"
28 December 2019,slightlymad22,3,7,9,I LOVE This Movie,"I just watched Thor: RagnarokI love this movie. Not only my favourite Thor movie, but one of my favourite Marvel movies. It is just so much damn fun. Taika Waititi Does a superb job.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor (who knew he was funny) Tessa Thompson is a welcome addition as Valkerye, I really like her. Jeff Goldblum is the constant joy the Jeff Goldblum is. Tom Hiddleston once again steals the show as Loki. I loved Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange scene, he nails that character.I know a lot of people don't like what happened with the Hulk, but I thought it was great."
25 February 2021,twegienk-03403,14,24,3,Everything was a pun,I did not enjoy this film. The humor was out of place with the narrative. Everything was a set up for a pun or joke. Their home explodes and boom! Someone makes a joke.
30 October 2017,irena_jelic,49,96,1,Big disappointment!,"This comment comes from a person who likes superhero movies! Thank you for ruining my favorite superhero! The movie is bullshit, the whole scenario is bullshit and you made the pussy out of Thor, the pussy without a hair and an eye!! I didn't read the comics so I don't know is this something according to the comics but honestly, I don't care all I know is that I've loved Marvel so far, the key word ""so far""!This is a lame excuse for a superhero movies. I like Marvel jokes but this is just too, too, tooo much, like every few seconds and good scenes are ruined with them not to mention unnecessary, stupid (""funny"") conversations of main or other characters.In my opinion DC will crash Marvel and after this kind of movie it should!!Thank God Justice League is only a week away so I could watch the REAL SUPERHERO MOVIE!"
1 November 2017,haosephiroth,139,278,1,A Total Disaster and here are the Details so Spoiler Alert,"EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THOR : RAGNAROKThe Movie was a total waste of time, the Hulk was shown to be with a child's mentality getting upset and doing children's moves. No explanation was given as to how the quinjet ended up on Sakkar, Age of Ultron in the time line comes after Thor the Dark World so even the explanation that he drifted into a spacetime bridge due to the conversion phenomenon is out of the question. The Hulk is Talking and no explanation is given for that he seems not angry anymore so why is he in Hulk mode in the first place.The second Stupid thing that the Marvel People didn't Even Bother to check was that in Thor the first movie Loki opened the Bifrost with the staff of ODEN (you can check the scene if you don't believe me) So how in HELL did Hela miss that knowing that she might be as ancient as Odin himself, not even once did she witness him open the Bifrost with his Staff?? They went to conquer the nine realms together so not knowing that is totally DUMB, if Loki knows it Hela should know it too.Before Loki screams ""BRING US BACK"" Thor say ""NO"" as if Hela couldn't reach Asgard without the Bifrost....? She appeared from HEL her Dimension into Midgard Earth without any Help why would she need the Bifrost to get There??? And if She so desperately needed the Bifrost for her conquest for the sake of argument she should have taken the sword the minute she landed on Asgard.AND How come the Devils ANUS gets you Directly to Asgard?? and if it does every time shouldn't the Grand Master know about it ? He seems not knowing what Asgard even is while his brother deals with Asgardians ??The Zombie Army is Stupid, they are slow, they are killable by simple asgardian citizens, what kind of an army is that?? Hela could conquer an entire planet by herself why would she need the dead weight.If Hela can't escape her Exile why did Odin send the Valkeries to finish her off in the first place ""knowing how powerful she is"" that was a dumb move on Odin's side. And we still don't know if Hela is bound to Exile because Odin is holding her off or how precisely because as mentioned before she can travel through dimensions at will. And if that's the case then she should be able to escape when Odin is weakened... say when he falls into the Odin sleep..?How did Odin abandon his responsibility as Protector of the nine realms and just went to Norway to enjoy the view is completely IDIOTIC and when confronted by his sons he just says ""it's your time now"" and vanishes?? He isn't injured, He is still capable of doing wonders but no he chose to turn into golden dust... That's pretty helpful thanks Odin.This movie went out of the frame that the fans and the Marvel Studios agreed upon, We expect action, a coherent story and good visual effects, if one of these elements is missing the movie sucks and frankly you should fire the scenario writers who put together Ragnarok because it's the Stupidest Movie Marvel Has Ever Made."
6 November 2017,kailomonkey,11,28,9,ready and primed for infinity wars,"After I read somewhere a comment that Thor Ragnarok was doing the same old Marvel things as expected and was ""funny""; 2 things that have annoyed me about some of the marvel movies... I actually felt encouraged to go watch the movie to see for myself. Boy were they wrong...There is quite a lot of humour in the movie but it works. There are various character tie-ins from other films but it works. The comedy isn't slapped on awkwardly it's part of the feel of the film and as for doing the same thing as previous marvel movies, I have to disagree...Throwing Thor into an all out distopian scifi world is something I've never seen for Thor or the other heroes before. This review might not be useful but it gets out my thoughts on the film.Anyway most the film was a great spectacle. Some of the main plot points were very obvious from the set up. Finally Thor (and others) is fully tied in to the scifi universe ready to combine with the guardians of the galaxy and all sorts of craziness.If you haven't watched a minimum of certain movies from the marvel universe you might be a bit lost as a viewer though. On the other hand if you've followed ALL the Marvel titles you'll be ready and primed for infinity wars after this movie..."
10 December 2021,MickeyTheConstant,4,9,10,Superb fun,"One of the MCUs best movies. For me it totally reinvented Thor and Loki. I found the first two Thor movies so weak and boring. Hemsworth and Hiddleston were great casting but the plots were dull. Ragnorak totally changed that. So much fun, great jokes, great new characters, great CGI, great sets, the Hulk having fun and being given some personality and Thor and Loki totally becoming two of my favourite characters, having a fine old romp. Really important addition to the MCU universe as it really made Loki a likeable character which has led to a complete character change for him within the MCU. Great stuff."
30 December 2021,QuentinBanterino,2,3,9,Thor: Ragnarok,"Ragnarok is one of the best films in the MCU, and a great development on the titular character and his responsibilities.After Civil War detailed a huge event with most of the superheroes, it was good to catch up with Thor and the Hulk. Valkyr is also really cool cool, pretty much all of the Sakarr stuff is great.Hela is also a badass, definitely one of the more impressive MCU villains. It felt a little silly that Surtur defeats her at the end, but ultimately the film is such a ride it hardly matters by the end.Ragnarak has comedy and tragedy in spades, balances characters like Thor, Hulk, Hela, and Heimdall brilliantly, & develops the Asgardian people as well as Thor effectively since the previous film."
29 November 2017,andreasgonatas,19,33,1,"how can this be considered a ""good""movie","How can anyone watch this crap and consider this to be fun to watch? I mean: anus jokes, actors who are more like comedians but who are terrible at it, space ships, gladiotors, aliens, weird dialogues that does not make any sense at all and on top of everything else the acting was atrocious. These overglorified actors have no creativity or whatsoever and rely heavely on repeating stuff they have done in the past and just copy paste everything. It's a shame that the audience just buy that crap and swallow it. The only 2 redeeming things this movie had are: 1: The exploration of the valkyries i wish there was more of that in the movie. 2: The exploration of the how asgard came to be which i also wished there was more of that."
20 November 2017,bora_mustafa,4,7,5,"It's an entertaining sequel, but if you're expecting a serious movie, forget it!!!!","Before I begin the review, I will say that the first Thor movie is still the best, and neither of the two sequels can match it. After seeing the trailer for Thor Ragnarok, I guessed that this would be a good film to watch and in all honesty I enjoyed it, it's definitely entertaining and I was never bored. So what is the movie about? Hela (The evil goddess) returns to Asgard to claim it as her own, and we very quickly find out she is Thor's older sister and that Thor and Loki have to team up in order to combat her. As it stands, Hela is too powerful for both brothers, and whilst attempting to escape via the bifrost, she follows them and basically throws both out to the galaxies. While Hela starts wreaking havoc, Thor must find a way to get back to Asgard to reclaim his throne.There's more to the story of course but I'll leave it at that. Now for the things I liked: Chris Hemsworth's Thor is as great as ever despite his odd character in this movie, he definitely proves that he can be very comedic and his expressions really made me laugh. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and he's still my favourite character, perfectly balancing his goodness as well as wickedness. Mark Ruffalo returns as the Hulk and while he's good, his Hulk was far too humanised in this movie, but I'll save the bads for a minute. Cate Blanchett is very good as Hela, though not really as menacing as I thought. I won't mention every character, it will just take forever!!! Now for the things I didn't like (and even some that I hated): The movie is played for laughs mostly and just when you think you're going to see something epic and serious, is immediately ruined to a lame one liner. I agree that the previous sequel ""The Dark World"" might have felt a little gloomy but at least it felt serious especially the sad scene with Thor's mother dying. With Thor Ragnarok everything is done as a joke, the scenes with Thor and Hulk are funny, don't get me wrong, but then we get Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) who pops up, slides between the Hulk's legs literally and gives Hulk a cheap shot kick which makes Hulk fall. Now a scene like that is a little too much to take.In fact the only character who thankfully didn't utter any one liners or any comedy was Heimdall. Another thing I don't get is the powers of each character. Loki started as badass in the first Thor and Avengers movie, yet here he gets beaten by Valkyrie. Hulk doesn't appear as badass as he was in the two Avengers movies and feels really dumbed down here which I didn't like. The mighty Thor himself doesn't seem all that powerful and I find it strange that Hela would be this powerful compared to her brother.Anyway I'll wrap this up, if you want an entertaining albeit silly dumb superhero movie, then you can't go wrong with Thor Ragnarok. If on the other hand you want to see a serious movie, don't even bother with this second sequel as (much like the recent Spiderman movie) it's a totally forgettable movie."
27 November 2017,js-84741,42,76,1,"As a longtime Marvel fan, I can't help but wonder WHAT they were thinking","Pros: Chris Hemsworth is great, finally allowed to be the star of his franchise. His performance brings a sense of continuity to the trilogy that otherwise wouldn't be there. The film also has truly hilarious moments, the best of which take place in the Hulk/Thor Gladiator fight.Cons: Everything else. The writing is TERRIBLE. Hela is probably the weakest villain the MCU has ever put out, right up there with Malekith and Ronan. There is no character development and the plot only exists as a joke telling mechanism. The whole film feels like a series of SNL skits that someone tried and failed to link together in a feature film. The action sequences are also deeply disappointing, amounting to nothing more than visual noise.I don't understand how anyone has been able to praise the storytelling in this film. After thinking about it a lot, I can only assume that it's the concept of the film that is being praised, the entire idea of combining Thor: Ragnarok with Planet Hulk and using Hela as the villain in a Thor/Banner buddy cop movie. And I completely agree that this plot is great — it's what had me so excited for this movie. However, the way it is delivered is awful. A basic concept in writing is show, don't tell (i.e. it's better to show your audience that someone is nervous than simply say ""He was nervous""). But from the very beginning, this movie tells the audience everything, spoon feeding us enough of a plot to keep the movie advancing in order to tell more jokes. Every big plot point is told to the audience and then never developed. For instance, the film's big twist is that Hela is Thor's sister. Odin tells us that in the very beginning of the movie and then nothing. It is never developed. We never feel that familial relationship between Hela, Thor and Loki. Compare that to the excellent way that Thor and The Avengers developed Thor and Loki's brotherly bond. It's a definitive attribute of their characters. However, if Hela hadn't been their sister, the movie would have unfolded exactly the same way, it made literally no difference to the film/characters. And there are so many unanswered questions. Was Frigga Hela's mother, or someone else? Would Frigga be okay with Odin locking their daughter away? Ultimately, it was such a random plot point at such a late stage in the Thor mythology and it never ended up paying off or connecting to anything else in the story. And then there's what this movie does to the Hulk. I could rant for a very long time about this, so I will just leave it at this: Ruffalo's Banner/Hulk under the direction of Joss Whedon has consistently been one of the best characters in the MCU. Both Banner and the Hulk have been used to great effect, showing that they can be both heartbreaking or hilarious in the very same movie. This film's shallow, oversimplified version has NONE of what has made the character so amazing in previous films and I find myself worrying that they've actually ruined the character. No, I don't hate that he talks. He's talked before and it's the natural progression of his character to become more intelligent/aware. But the way that they decided to execute this character progression, all in the name of comedy rather than character development, was terrible.The action sequences were awful as well. The MCU has shown through properties like Winter Soldier, The Avengers, and Daredevil that they can produce creative action sequences that are unique in tone, execution, or narrative. This movie did none of that. The action was CGI heavy and indistinct. In Daredevil or a Russo Brother's movie, I can feel every punch that is thrown. In this movie it was an unoriginal mess of visual noise that lacked any sense of scale. Every battle sequence, but especially the final one, fell extremely flat. I also thought a lot of the CGI and green screens were really evident, giving the movie a fake quality. However, this could have been purposeful to mimic the 80's feel the movie was striving for, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt on that one.My final complaint is one I never expected to have. Two Marvel properties came out in November, The Punisher and Thor: Ragnarok. One of those movies featured gratuitous violence and tried to get the audience to laugh at grotesque images. It wasn't The Punisher. Yes, of course The Punisher was far more graphic and emotionally disturbing, but that is for the sake of developing the character and story and dealing with important issues. Thor: Ragnarok featured several scenes that were just so strange in their violence that they literally took me out of the movie. The first was the introduction of Valkyrie, in which she murders a group of people, literally reducing them to dust, without giving them a warning or chance to run. My jaw dropped and I heard someone in front of me say ""Wow, they're going there?"" Yet, unlike many other violent Marvel properties, we were never supposed to question if this made Valkyrie a hero or a villain. The next scene that stood out was the prolonged shot of Bruce Banner's shattered, grotesque body on the rainbow bridge. The shot was meant to and succeeded in earning laughs, reducing Banner's uncertain fate to a joke. Certain movies, such as Deadpool, demand these kinds of creative choices to do justice to the character's world and experience. Thor was never one of these characters. As someone who LOVES Marvel, this was the first time I've walked away from an MCU movie feeling completely disappointed. This film didn't seem to respect itself, let alone the rest of the MCU or the people who love these stories. I only hope it won't damage the MCU moving forward."
15 December 2018,chaitumhyd,3,5,7,Korg,"One of my favorite characters even though he had about 5mins of screen time. Korg.Hey man, my name is Korg... I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you... You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
24 October 2017,l-r-patrick,20,49,5,average to say the least,"I don't get all the 10 star reviews, did these people ever read the comics and know the characters? As it does not add up if they did! Actors were good, so good casting, but the story is awful, it's a mish-mash of at least five different good stories from people who knew how to write good comics back in the day. The characters, are not as they should be for some reason, I guess the Hollywood writers had a basic bio of the characters, and then just wrote whatever pleased them without doing any research. The comedy is throughout, why is there so much I don't know, if I want comedy, I'll watch the carry on films. Really gutted, Marvel Studios obviously and unfortunately can't do serious anymore, it almost feels like a mockery. Don't waste your time with the end credit scene, totally a waste of time. Give me Watchmen any day of the week over this, although I'll confess it was an improvement on the last Thor film. Please Marvel Studios, get a proper writing team and give up on this average cramped up stories you're giving us!A wise man once said, Nuff Said!"
5 November 2017,despoiler-77244,23,39,3,Way too comedic,"First, in full disclosure, I am a Thor comic fan. That being said, I am not one who feels that movie adaptations have to strictly follow the comic versions of characters or stories. I do believe that the movies should follow the spirit of the character though, and that means more than casting a passable actor with convincing special effects. I know there are a lot of people out there that think this was a great movie because of the added comedy, but I disagree. There was far too much tongue-in-cheek content. There is a way to balance lighthearted relief with some dignity, and they failed to do it in this movie. The scenes that took the plot seriously were more the exception than the rule. Despite his penchant for quick action, Thor is not a fool, and he is certainly not a clown. It's fine for such a character to make mistakes, and even to be humiliated by a miscalculation, but the writers and director have an obligation to make it convincing. So here are the spoilers. Thor's capture. How does an electric net, or a tiny shock device immobilize a being who can channel lighting through his body? How does any such device even survive the devastating amount of power he wields. It wasn't convincing, it wasn't funny, and it wasn't even clever.Loki. In the Avengers, Loki was a master strategist with global ambitions, and a frightening adversary. This movie reduced him to a petty con-man with no consideration for the long term consequences of his short-sighted decisions. How does a former king of Asgaard decide it's in his best interest to grovel favor from the local despot of a trash kingdom. I totally get that the Grandmaster in the comics is a being of cosmic consequence, but there was no indication that in this story. Hiddleston's Loki was a show stealer, now he's almost a punchline."
28 October 2017,jimcarpenter,45,87,4,Marvel reduced to a poor comedy!!,"How could Marvel do this? We all know that the comedy moments in the 
 previous films were great but this one seems as though they have based 
 an entire film on silly quips and poor comedy scenes. In one scene Thor 
 and the Hulk are reduced to squabbling toddlers. Some of the action 
 scenes to music were very good but just not enough to save the film. 
 Thor comes across as more ""Johnny English - bumbling fool"" than 
 superhero. Lets hope the next instalment goes back to a superhero film 
 with the odd comedy moment rather than the other way around."
6 November 2017,peci-89549,9,17,7,Unbalanced powers,"The movie is good, entertaining etc, but not perfect as Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 1. The weak points are: it slightly resembled for a movie of Guardians of the Galaxy (the scenery, the comedy part), but it can be still acceptable. What me most disturbed the unbalanced power. One of the strongest Avenger (who smashed Hulk through the Arena even not using its lightnings just a huge hammer), the God of Thunder (electricity) could be captured by an electric net by a bunch of intergalactic beggar. Loki was reduced to a looser (even beaten by a simple (alchoholic) valkyrie), not that fearful cunning villain as we know him. Dr. Strange became a GOD, if Thor is a demi-god or what. He eliminated Thor and Loki with a hand wave and he can create material (eg: beer) from nothing. Then the ALL SUPER POWER WEAPON was introduced, yes that tiny electric device. Take one and put it on Hella (and save Asgard), on Thanos (no need of Infinity War 1-2) on any one. I beg Disney not to be that simple in the following movies. It was really annoying!"
5 November 2017,arnoldmrs,26,46,1,The second worst MCU movie until now,"So badly, Ragnarok is not only a threat to Asgard, but also to the entire Marvel Cinematographic Universe (MCU). If the next Avengers (Infinity War) movie follows the same line we may have the end of these franchise much sooner than we expected... Of the nearly 20 MCU films so far, only the Hulk solo movie has managed to be worse than this one. There is no exciting moment in the movie, the soundtrack is very weak, the performances are weak, the characters are two-dimensional, the script is weak and the list goes on. Some of the main characters in the two other Thor films simply disappeared as if they had never existed and others had irrelevant roles. The only characters from the other two movies with relevant roles in this one are Thor himself and Loki, but with totally altered personalities. The two were transformed into clowns. Clearly it's just a comedy movie with action scenes, but it's not even funny to watch. The background story is tragic and does not match with the slapstick comedy they tried to do. Okay, they tried to copy Guardians of the Galaxy (GG), but it did NOT work. GG is genuinely funny and has its exciting/sentimental moments. In Ragnarok there are bland jokes even in the most dramatic moments. Nothing against comedy. The original Avengers movie itself had very funny scenes, but at the same time it reconciled it with moments of seriousness and emotion. Ragnarok looks more like a parody of Thor than a Marvel movie. The film script looks more like a Swiss cheese, with so many holes. Now I will describe some of these plot holes, which can be considered a SPOILER, but I do not advise anyone to waste time watching this movie anyway... I also advise nobody to bring children to watch this movie, because there are death scenes that are treated as comedy and in one of the very few serious scenes in the movie in which a character dies impaled, I heard a six years old boy laughing. Thor's two previous films were not brilliant, but they were competent in portraying the characters and their fictional universe and extremely better as a movie than this fiasco. Now the 21 worst holes in the movie: 1 - Lady Sif, one of the main characters of the other two films is not even mentioned. 2 - Why does Thor, along with Hulk and several other allies give up Hela without practically trying? Thor's extreme and desperate attitude is totally improbable ... Having Hulk an impenetrable skin, it is hard to believe that Hela's strange power to materialize blades would be able to defeat him. 3 - Asgard, a whole planet, seems to have little more than 500 inhabitants and all living in the same city! 4 - Thor does not care or comment on the death of his three best friends. 5 - Thor doesn't care about the destruction of his entire planet. Even other inhabitants living outside that city and the nature. As if he had lived hundreds of years in one place and had no regard for anything. 6. How do everyone on earth know of the details of the relationship between Thor and Jane? Has Thor a Facebook account of public figure?!? 7 - Relationally with Jane is discarded with just one comic phrase, making the previous films ridiculous and meaningless. 8 - Why did you spend money hiring Matt Damon and Sam Neil for ridiculous roles? Was it supposed to be funny? 9 - Why did Valkyrie keep - for THOUSANDS of years - a grievance of Asgard? 10 - Why does Valkyrie suddenly, after these THOUSANDS of years - change her mind and help Thor by risking his own life? 12 - Why is Valkyrie's alcoholism treated as a joke and the same theme banned in another MCU movie? 13 - How Valkyrie, being thousand years older than Thor, does not appear to be older than him? 14 - How does Banner die and rise again? In the original Avengers movie, it is explained that the transformation in Hulk takes place to avoid the Banner's death, which was great, but not that he is able to resurrect Banner after dead. The scene was made like this just to be funny, but it was non sense like almost everything in the movie. 15 - How is Thor slain by Hulk and does not show a scratch? 16 - Loki takes power in Asgard just to make some jokes and eat fruit, wasting a comedy scene on a plot that had been crafted for years by at least three movies (Thor 1 and 2 and The Avengers). 17 - On the planet Hulk, in the arena fight, Thor gets all electrified, but that does not overload the shock disk circuit on his neck. 18 - Incidentally for someone who gets all electrified, having a shock disk as the main weakness is just another plot hole ... ""Like Odin, did you know that Thor and Loki were coming?"" 19 - How does Hela appear from nothing after Odin's death? 20 - How was Hela so powerful early in the movie being so far from Asgard - her source of power? 21- In a scene that a man is melted and the only reaction of Thor is of disgust in a comic scene, which does not match at all with the character and ends up aggravating the trivialization of death that is the tonic of the attempt of comedy in the entire movie."
18 November 2017,jboothmillard,5,17,8,Thor: Ragnarok,"The first Thor film was good, Avengers Assemble was brilliant, The Dark World was great, this is the third solo movie for one of the key heroes in the Marvel Universe, and I was very excited to see it. Basically it is two years after the Battle of Sokovia, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur (Clancy Brown), during his unsuccessful search for the Infinity Stones. Surtur reveals Thor's father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard, and the prophesied Ragnarök will destroy his realm, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor breaks his chains and defeats Surtur, claiming his crown, believing his has prevented Ragnarök, returning to Asgard he finds that Odin is actually his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is disguise, Thor forces Loki to help him find their father. With the help of Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) on Earth, Thor and Loki find Odin in Norway, he explains that he is dying, he reveals that he has a firstborn child, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who was sealed in a prison long ago, Odin's passing will allow her to escape. Hela is known as the ""goddess of death"", she was leader of Asgard's armies, and had conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but she imprisoned and written out of history after Odin feared she had become too ambitious. Odin dies, and Hela released from imprisonment appears, she destroys Thor's hammer Mjolnir, Thor and Loki try to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, but she pursues them and forces them out into space. Hela travels to Asgard, destroying its army and the Warriors Three, she resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including the giant wolf Fenris, and appoints Asgardian Skurge (Karl Urban) as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry Heimdall (Idris Elba) has stolen the sword that controls the Bridge, he has gathered the rest of Asgard's citizens to hide away. Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes, he is captured by bounty hunter Scrapper 142, aka Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and taken to the planet's ruler, the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). There Loki has already become ingratiated, but Thor will serve as a gladiator, Thor recognises 142 as a Valkyrior, a legendary force of female warriors who were killed defending Asgard from Hela long ago. After his hair cut shorter, Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, the undefeated champion turns out to be Thor's old friend the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), they fight, with Thor eventually summoning lightning to almost defeat the Hulm, before the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure the Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither are willing to help, Thor manages to escape the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar, Hulk follows him, he is only transformed back into Bruce Banner seeing a recording of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) for the first time since Sokovia. The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, 142 decides to help, after reliving the deaths of her fellow Valkyrie at the hands of Hela, Loki helps the group to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships they then liberate the other gladiators, including Korg (Taika Waititi, also directing), to stage a rebellion. Loki attempts to betray his brother to gain a reward from the Grandmaster, but Thor anticipated this and leaves him behind, he is soon found by the gladiators, while Thor, Banner and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and Asgard's citizens. Banner becomes Hulk again, fighting Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle Skurge and the resurrected warriors, Loki and the gladiators soon arrive to help, the citizens are evacuated boarding the large ship, a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to allow their escape. Thor and Hela battle, Thor loses his eye during the fight, he has a vision of Odin that helps him realise only Ragnarök can stop Hela, so while Hela is distracted, Loki finds Surtur's crown and places it in the Eternal Flame, Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela. Thor and the others escape with the remaining citizens aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, forced to watch the prophesied destruction of their home, Thor is crowned king, he decides to take his people to Earth, the mid- credits sequence sees them pursued by a large spaceship, and the post- credits sequence sees the Grandmaster encountering a group of his former subjects, who are still rebelling. Also starring Rachel House as Topaz, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Luke Hemsworth (Chris's brother) as Actor Thor, Sam Neill as Actor Odin, Matt Damon as Loki Actor, Charlotte Nicdao as Actor Sif and Stan Lee as the Barber. Hemsworth remains great as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Hiddleston makes a welcome return being nasty and making snide quips, Blanchett looks like she's having a blast as the over-the-top but gorgeously wicked villain, and there is great support from Ruffalo, Goldblum, Hopkins and Cumberbatch. Whereas previous entries have been a little technological and filled with complicated bits, this takes things back to basics, just creating a simple story of a prophesied apocalypse and the hero needing to save the world, but what makes this entry much more interesting is not just the brilliant special effects and fight sequences, but there is much more comedy as well, very witty dialogue and deliberately silly stuff, overall it is a fresh, highly entertaining and exciting fantasy action adventure film. Very good!"
23 January 2018,psychedelicvoice,3,5,5,"I really like the superhero stuff, but...","I always wait for a new superhero movie. Cannot wait to see it. What they bring. But this one.. I feel there is something off putting. They joke too much around. The acting is okay, I guess. But they just joke a bit too much in this one. Hulk does not sound so tough as he should be. 2 of the most powerful heros and still able to be captured and not do something about it, kinda.. weak imo. I would say, this was okay, but I feel a bit let down. I dislike them for trying too hard making some jokes out of it. I miss the acting from the Avengers movies. I miss the more seriousness from them as well."
9 November 2017,ckimichels,11,21,8,Entertaining,"Full disclosure: My first thought was to give this a 7, but I must admit I upped it a point based on my enduring affection for Jeff Goldblum and the eye candy that is Tom H. What can I say, I'm into tall, lean and dark haired guys with gorgeous eyes and unique noses (hubby is all that). Bearing in mind that this franchise is based on comic book characters I obviously don't expect depth in the story line but a coherent story is a plus. Although of all the Marvel movies to date I found this one to have the most laugh out loud scenes, it was the lesser in the series in cohesive plot. It seemed to be more focused on setting up situations in the Thor/Hulk arena battle than what I presumed was supposed to be main story line about the rise of the wicked sister. Her character was a bit flat and one dimensional and the ultimate battle with her felt rushed and seemed to be rather shallow as if it were an afterthought. Some directors are able to frame scenes so they express a lot in short time, this movie seemed to take a long time to express very little except as a setup for a punchline. On the whole it was an enjoyable and ""eye pleasing"" little flick."

19 March 2022,Alexand_er,9,16,1,This Is Good?,"I'm not one for 1/10 reviews, but considering how kids and childish adults can't seem to watch or enjoy anything without dumb comedy relief littered throughout things now, I'm not surprised at all that I feel this way.They ""marveled"" the Thor movies. They made him a joke, an unfunny joke. The story has no point as it's all just cheap gags and nothing is serious, at all. They play a rolling stones song (I think it is anyway) near the start and it's all jokes for a good 20+ minutes, then they cut to an apparent serious scene were Thor and Loki's Father has a scene where he dies or similar, and the emotion they try to play out is pathetic considering the first 20 minutes of the movie. Like it's supposed to be this rollercoaster of emotion of haha's to ""Aww that's so sad"" when it isn't at all.If you like incredibly childish marvel movies, then you will undoubtedly love this."

                        ",Almost a standalone,"The general movie audience would have by now been aware, even if vaguely, that this third instalment of Thor is different. The titular character is somewhat different from the one we know. While he keeps insisting that he is the ""god of thunder"" he comes across more as an everyday comic (as in funny) character. It may be a long shot but it could just be possible that the movie makers have seen Chris Hemsworth in ""Ghostbusters"" (2016), recognized his talents, and wrote his part accordingly in ""Thor: Ragnarok"". You can arguably call this a stand-alone movie. It happens mostly in the mythical worlds although there are brief glimpses of Earth.The prologue has Thor suspended in chains, facing the demonic Surtur who swears to bring about Ragnarok (Norse mythology of massive battle resulting in the death of the gods Odin, Thor and Loki, among others) which, for this movie, accents on the total destruction of Asgard, Thor's homeland. With more-than-usual comic quips, a sign of things to come, the call-for-hammer routine plays out, as usual. Next, Thor gets to Asgard, ""beam-me-up"" fashion, and finds everything changed. For a start, the guardian of the portal who does the beaming is no longer Heimdall (Idris Elba) but a replacement called Skurge (Karl Urban, also known as Eomer or Bones). Most importantly, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is purportedly on a self-imposed exile while Loki (Tom Hiddleston) seems to be in charge. Skipping some details, the brothers are in Earth next, seeking advice from Dr Strange (a delightful Benedict Cumberbatch). They find Odin in lonely contemplation on a breath-taking coastal cliff. Just as soon as Odin disappears after telling them about their first-born sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), she appears with lofty claims, including The Queen of Death. For the first time, Thor finds himself over-matched (well, maybe not, if you think of The Hulk). Far worse, his iconic hammer is shattered. If you think that there cannot be a Thor without his hammer, think again.From this point, the story forks into parallel narratives. In Asgard, Hela take over, with a lot of killing. Thor finds himself, sans hammer, in a junkyard world called Sakaar, taken first by a bounty hunter Valkarie (an endearing Tessa Thompson) and then handed over to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who runs a gladiator joint. At the coliseum, overjoyed to find his opponent to be a ""friend from work"", Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor is soon dismayed when the latter tells him that ""there is no Banner; only Hulk"". The most enjoyable part of the movie is this sequence on Sakaar, essentially in watching the pair that critics variously liken to Bob Hope/Bing Crosby, Laurel/Hardy and, yes, Abbott Costello. Valkarie finally joins them forming a trio (reminding you of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) with the quest of saving their homeland (not Banner's, but he'll help). Meanwhile, back in Asgard Heimdall, stealing the sword of the portal, leads a resurgence. Hela appoints Skurge ""Executioner"". Big brawl brewing.This movie is rich in funnies. Here are just a few examples. 1. A comment on a three-prong wooden fork as a possible weapon is that ""it is only useful against three vampires bundled together"". 2. Someone casually calls Loki ""lackey"". 3. Thor, uncharacteristically cunning, tells Hulk that he does not like Banner, then later tells Banner that he does not like Hulk. There are a lot more of these moments.Hemsworth's somewhat altered persona of Thor is well received by critics and audience alike. Ruffalo must be having a lot of fun perfecting what he does best, accentuating the battle of Hulk vs Banner. Hiddleston seems to be having an easy time with still a considerable share of screen time but playing a much less demanding role of a light(er)-weight side kick, a ""god of mischief."" Valkarie is a successful newcomer, not the least because of good casting. When a man obviously totally stoned appears on a movie screen, it is usually a bore. But with a woman drunk and stumbling all over the place, as in Thompson's first appearance as Valkarie, there is undeniably a certain charm. When later it is revealed that the taking to alcohol is to drown some painful memories, the heroine has the audience's heart. Valkarie takes on the name of her entire people of Asgard female warriors because she is the only survivor after the massive slaughter by Hela. Thompson ably delivers this engaging character.The demand on Blanchett from this movie would be just a fraction of the Oscar Winning ""Blue Jasmine"" (2013). I cannot fault her portrayal of pure evil here but personally much prefer Galadriel in the LORT trilogy. Of the other newcomers, Goldblum and Urban carry their roles with sufficient authority, while Cumberbatch is an iconic cameo. Of the regulars, Hopkins and Elba have small parts only, but are good to see. I am also pleased to see Tadanobu Asano reprising Hogun, albeit just brief appearance at the beginning. Oh yes, you will see Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, if you don't blink."
24 October 2017,gerry_barnaby,12,39,6,incoherent mess that doesn't understand what Ragnarok mean's,"Likes : I'm sorry if you're looking for the bandwagon ten star review here you're better off look at a marvel fanboy review, because here you're getting an honest and straight to the point review on this film.Now i'm not gonna complete trash this film as there we're moment in this film that we're funny but sadly not many moment, the action scene including the the fight between ""Thor"" and the ""Hulk"" we're good in areas but had one major flaw with this scene which i will explain in dislikes.The main character that stood out more was Cate Blanchett playing Hela (the goddess of death), my god did she play this with perfection as she carves her way through Asgard solider with easy she is a force to be reckon with. Cate clearly was perfect casting for this role with a very sexy look in a dark way and very charismatic villain in having one purpose to destroy and control.Tessa Thompson didn't do a bad job with her role as a ""Valkyrie"" which we go a slight back story of why she no longer with Asgard, she does add a little bit humor to the film, with Karl Urban character not sure where the writer of this film were going with this character but seem a bit of a waste as he wasn't really doing much though the film. Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dr strange in the film as a cameo like iron man but shorter scene was a little funny in places but a little over the top, Jeff Goldblum playing the grand master one of the ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations' games of skill and chance, did OK with this role you could see he had fun with this role.Mark Ruffalo Hulk is a little different in this film as the look and manor of the character has changes but still the same hulk, there a few jokes though around about the other avengers, Chris Hemsworth put in a OK performance and did offer some funny moments though the film as well as the bad ass look with the lighting around him which gave the character a better flare.Although this film is entertaining in areas and some of the visual effect we're good, sadly this film was full of flaws that makes it a mess.Dislikes : The visual effect in this film throughout most scene felt like an amateur had done it on a cheap PC, even from the scene which is in the trailer when Hela smashed the hammer was bad. This scene of where they are before this event happens look seriously bad, specially when they are looking out at the sea you could see that this scene is in front of them is a Green screen. This just made the scene so fake it almost take's you out of the moment they are trying to portray and clearly from the trailer the alleyway scene was so much better, it's looked like they swap the ally-way scene for a cheap look visual effect cliff-side which they should of kept with the ally-way it would have looked better.The concept alone was a complete mess even for a marvel film, i know a lot of fans will say he just a Dc fanboy marvel hater but i'm not saying this for the sake of trashing this film it really is that bad from a critic stand point.The film doesn't know what it trying to be iver a comedy or serious it just come off so bad it pull the film even some of the joke and humor fall flat which is bad for comedy, some of them feel completely forced at time to make it funny. Sadly the only funny part in the whole film was Thor with a bowling ball, that one scene was the only time i hear the audience laugh because that was funny.It like the Director or writers have forgotten what Ragnarok actually mean's and they've try to make a comedic film with a serious tone (sorry but this just doesn't work in a film), specially a film with Cate Blanchett character who's very tone is very dark, this should've been a lot more serious, darker and the humor less maybe this would've work for the story alone. Instead we get this incoherent mess with music that doesn't even fit the film what so ever with bad jokes and over use of the word like a child would do using the word Ass several times, sorry but Thor 3 Ragnarok is by far the 2nd worst movie marvel has done even though it was entertaining. P.S There two end credit scenes but the very end credit scene wasn't even worth staying behind to see after the credit rolled, it was a waste of time even adding it as it was nothing to do with Infinity war."
17 December 2021,brad071,5,7,10,Best of them all,TAIKA WAITITI should have directed all of the MCU especially all the Avenger stuff...this was piss-funny 🤣 he's one of the most funny and astute directors at the moment. Awesome.
10 June 2018,Sweetigal85,1,1,6,"I prefer the original two, but this one is still entertaining","I definitely prefer the original two Thor movies to this one. The absence of Jane, Natalie Portman's character was a major bummer for me and I loathed the simple and fast explanation that she ""dumped him."" Who would dump Thor, The Thunder God? Come on, now! I know they had to come up with something lame since Portman refused to be in the third one but ugh.The other two Thor movies took place on Earth while this one jets all over the galaxy. It felt like it was trying to rip off Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy. The constant one liners and jokes really started to give me a headache after a while. I really wish that they would make these movies more serious and less comedic. I guess they have to do what they can for the twelve year olds watching.Cate Blanchett is simply phenomenal in anything she does, including this. I wish they had focused more on her character instead of the BS on the ""fighting planet."" Much of the film felt like a colorful acid trip and was so bright that it hurt my eyes at times. Speaking of eyes, who wouldn't want to see our beloved Thor get his eye ripped out and stay that way? UGH such nonsense.I wish the film had been more about Thor, Loki and their newfound sister, Hela. The film had such potential, even without Jane, and instead they chose to focus on glitz and glam and kicks and punches. I personally am not a huge fan of the hulk, I think he is good in small doses. I also was not a fan of the Valkyrie girl who only drank, kicked and punched everyone the entire movie. Interesting how now in society it is OK to beat a man senseless and that's supposed to be hilarious, but if it was the other way around it is abhorrent. And there are many questions that get left unanswered. Was Oden really as much of a monster as Hela claimed? Why did Oden even die? Was it because he had been in the mortal realm for too long and lost his powers of preservation? If so, why was Thor not more angry at Loki for this? I am also furious that they cut Thor's hair and even more furious when I found out that it was Hemsworth's dumb idea. I enjoyed his lightning powers after his hammer was destroyed. Though the idea of Thor without his hammer is kinda lame. But I enjoyed the lightning effects and the ten minutes Doctor Strange was in the movie. I liked how Hela's minion redeemed himself, he deserved more time as well. I found the whole thing with the fire creature demon to be very confusing and I do not feel like he has ever been mentioned before. Hela's fall was very anti climactic, I feel like she should have spoken with her brothers more before she got instantly crushed by that demon.Jeff Goldblum's character was interesting and funny but I got sick of all the space BS very quickly. I am not a huge fan of creatures, I wish they would have just stuck to Asgarde and Earth. Overall, it was entertaining and funny but definitely did not have the heart and depth of the original two. Definitely worth a watch and I am betting most people will likely enjoy it more than I did. I have high standards when it comes to these super hero movies and lately I feel like they have been sacrificing plot for special effects."
6 December 2021,IQ42,4,9,9,Finally a strong foe,"Best Thor movie yet, wow!Finally, finally there is a mighty enemy in a Marvel movie. Namely the Goddess of Death. We immediately see how strong she is when she just takes Thor's hammer and dissects it to pieces with her bare hands.Thor is trapped on a weird planet and has to go through all kinds of troubles to get back to Asgard for a final battle. He even finds Banner along the way! Unfortunately, I was already spoiled by reading about the cast but that was still pretty cool. The final battle was a dilemma but overcoming this dilemma led to victory.Strong villain, humor, plot, character development - this movie had it all."
12 November 2017,deepeshgurung,29,52,3,cheap jokes at the expense of immersive story,"Firstly if you are looking for a comedy movie or just want to turn your brain off for 2 hours and enjoy a good cinematic experience, I would give this movie a 9/10. And there is nothing wrong with a superhero comedy. Deadpool and GoTG vol.1 were great. However, my first and most important criteria of the movie is the story. To be fair, There are plenty of good things in this movie. The story is internally consistent. On broad strokes, I can understand the character's motivations which lead to the conflict. Thor hits all major steps in the heroic journey. In the climax he even surpasses his father, making a choice Odin could not, to defeat Hela. The final bridge scene to Led Zepplin was excellently set up. Even with all the merits above, at the end of the movie, I did not care about any of the event or any of the characters. And why would I?, the characters barely seemed to. Every dramatic scene, every obstacle or triumph, all seem to just be there to bridge the movie to it's next punchline. The story implies Thor becomes a wiser and stronger king than Odin in the end. We know from the events of the movie he has been through hell (figuratively) and sacrificed a lot. But looking at Thor, apart from the obvious appearance( hair length etc.), there is nothing to suggest there had been a change. In the end of the movie, Thor still seems to be the same character(happy go lucky) he was in the beginning. I might as well have watched a movie length version of old Popeye cartoon with high production budget. ****Spoilers Below***** Examples. 1.Although Cate Blanchett is an awesome actor, why is her character ,after being betrayed and imprisoned by her own father for millennia, quipping jokes. 2.On the day after Thor learned he had a sister, saw his father die and knows his home faces dire threat; he is still fixated on his broken. Even if we consider the fact that Thor just values his hammer more than his family and home, why is not more angry or distraught for his loss.****End of Spoiler****And, if neither of these character care enough to show any emotions toward the events of their movie's story, why should I? And if I don't care about the story why should I bother investing 2 hours watching a movie. I can just as easily read some memes or watch animal videos to get the same laughs."
27 October 2017,boboklid,35,70,2,Dreadful,"This was just bad... While looking away from the fact that I hated the movie, what good did it bring us? What more do we know to the big picture of MCU? SPOILERS AHEAD Alright, Asgard is no more and the spaceship they've all left on is probably a lot less of existing than Asgard. Oh and that Tesseract is most likely not on Asgard anymore. For one that place is destroyed but I don't care about that, Lokis face said it all. Okay, that's one major-ish thing to the MCU... This was simply not Thor. Marvel is known and loved for their humor spice in their movies but Thor was never built on them and wasn't meant to be. Thor was and is supposed to be serious with a few chuckle moments, and not a comedy with a very few serious moments. If you ask me, this was Guardians of the galaxy 2.5 with different cast."
2 April 2020,Aman1017,3,4,10,Thor: Ragnarok is a Materpiece!,"Taika Waititi directing Thor: Ragnarok was probably the best thing that happed to Thor. It was so brilliantly made and Waititi brought his own style and allowed everyone to improvise, for the better. This is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movie!Thor: Ragnarok was really a dark film sugarcoated with an upbeat tone and so much comedy. That's why it's so great! High stakes, genocide, and Asgard falling.
I always thought Odin was near perfect but now we know of his dark past thanks to Hela.Cate Blanchett was amazing portraying Hela! I don't read comics but I know a great villain when I see one. As far as the rest of the cast, they were great too. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston's brotherly chemistry was nothing less than perfect. Nothing we haven't seen before from Thor, Loki, and Heimdall but the addition of Tessa Thompson, Mark Ruffalo, and Jeff Goldblum was amazing.Although this movie wasn't perfect, everyone played their roles perfectly, the story was interesting, and the movie was complemented by an intriguing soundtrack"
19 April 2022,Oscar078,2,2,10,GOD OF THUNDER,An absolute kick ass film with a ton of action that makes the viewer feel powerful and the new hair is better than the long one I am a small time fan of thor wasn't too dazzled by the other thor movies but this one feels like a new journey for thor.
20 November 2017,davish_wulf-1,4,9,3,Best part? The Led Zeppelin music,"Went to see this with very low expectations, after seeing the trailer: A hammerless Thor with a new haircut battling Hulk in a Arena. Movie was interesting until half-way, then it became a complete Walt Disney mess. I don't know if I was watching a Guardians of the Galaxy 3 movie, or actually a ""Thor"" movie. Ships everywhere, Hela lost her ""charm"" in the second half, just to appear in the end. First you develop a character (somehow), then the rest of the movie you forget about her only to appear in a boss-like spawn to give meaning to the ""Ragnarok"" title. Jokes everywhere, to the point the movie becomes itself a joke. Movie went towards a ""pew pew"" Star-Wars fest over a trashcan landscape. Forced characters like Hulk appearing out of nowhere, with a lame excuse to appear at all. Again Asian guys with ""samurai"" like armies, wiped out in seconds (if this is why asians appear in a Viking scenery, I might call it ""racism""). Lifeless Asgard gets destroyed, Thor lost an eye, his hair and his hammer. Odin is a lame old man, all dressed in pink (and I thought Odin was the most powerful god in Vikings mythology) staring at the sea... really? Loki's role is bland and unnecessary, even disappearing for quite a long time (who cares anyway, he just got lost in the Universe). Plot holes everywhere, but hey, it's OK.. it's a Marvel movie, we can mess around with gravity and logic, since it's ""fiction"". One more dark Valkyrie (as if Heimdall wasn't enough already). I dread to think what Thor 4 will be like... I thought this was going to be bad, never thought It could be ""this bad"".One positive note aside, Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" appears in the beginning and last battle... perhaps all the Bieber's out there start listening to good music, or even kids under 10 start noticing good rock out there, since it's the only thing ""real"" on this complete mess, 5 year old plot movie."
19 November 2017,hdoscripts,6,10,4,"Could Have Been Great, but Wasn't Even Close!","They should have called this Guardians of the Galaxy 3. They changed the entire feel of the Thor movies. Instead of a serious movie with a some humor, it was comedy with a little seriousness in it. Guardians of the Galaxy was set up with humor from the first film. Thor was not. Why? Why would you change it into something it's not? Stick with what's made the Thor movies good. Many of the ""funny"" lines were forced & weren't funny. Why introduce Dr Strange in this movie? That was pointless. Too many unanswered questions in this one. A HUGE disappointment!"

7 February 2019,benjamincallinicos,2,3,7,A radical soft reboot that delivers a damn good time!,"Taika Watiti and Marvel Studios delivered a radical new formula for the character of Thor, and they gave us a fun crowd pleaser that looks and feels like a classic Marvel comic book!This movie has great performances, particularly by Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum, as well as stunning visuals and great improvisational comedy from the actors involved.Sometimes the humour went a bit over the top and Asgard getting destroyed was kind of tough to watch but nevertheless, this film was another one of Marvel's best movies which many Superhero films will take inspiration for years to come."
26 October 2017,GomezAddams666,7,25,6,Not worth it,"I will try not to give out any spoilers, but at the same time I must warn you about this movie, yes, you read it right, warn you.We all know the Thor movies are not exactly the brightest gem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but after the mistakes of Thor: The Dark World you would think they would have learned their lesson, after all this movie is the end of the trilogy and I am personally happy it finally ends.The movie tries to mix two classic stories from the comics: Ragnarok and Planet Hulk, very ambitious I must say, but this is a blend that will make you ill, let me explain you why.The movie is 130 minutes long, yet one of the greatest and more powerful villains the MCU has ever had, Hela, only gets about 20 minutes of screen time, and in those 20 minutes you can see Cate Blanchett trying her hardest to give depth to the character, but even someone as immensely talented as her cannot pull the impossible, Hela, The Goddess of Death has been turned into a 2 dimensional cartoon.The first act is pretty weak, and you can see the script rushes as much as they possibly can to get to the second act, which is where they try to adapt Planet Hulk, and that part takes most of the screen time and it is so boring it is not even funny. They tried to integrate a space opera of revolution against an evil dictator into the story of Ragnarok, but it is rushed, contrived and boring, and I mean mind boggling boring.Then we get to the third act where the battle takes place in Asgard and Hela's army fights ""The Revengers"", I won't spoil any further but I will say that when you think quality will improve, it does not, not one bit.This entry has to be hands down one of the worst movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am an MCU fan boy but I have to be truthful, and I give it 6/10, and I am being nice. This was an amalgamation of two stories that could have been great as separate entities, but not combined, at least not in the incompetent hands of Taika Waititi, who does not deserve respect at all."

Its supposed to be an Action movie with some comedic relieve but this is a comedy movie with some action relieve.So bad."

Thor doesn't win this battle he runs. Hulk it seems was there simply for a few good laughs never used to his full potential. He never helps Thor against hela, doesn't fight anyone after his battle with Thor until the end and that ""epic"" fight with fenrir was over in 3 moves sent the doggy on his way down the waterfall then Hulk Disappears again until the end. There were some truly funny moments but they are overtaken I'm afraid by the rest of this circus sideshow mediocre movie."
27 February 2018,papania,9,15,1,Terrible joke.,"This movie is littered with awful, stupid jokes. That itself is not sich a bad thing, but the fact that every scene, every somewhat serious moment leads up to a cheap gag just disappoints me. Thor isn't Thor anymore. He's not a brutal god from Asgard, he's a silly joker, a walking comedic relief. He acts like a simple guy from Earth, I can't see how he's still ""Thor"".You can't take ANYTHING in this movie seiously. Everything was made for gags.
Maybe you can laugh first 5-6 times, but then you just cringe every time this movie throws another stupid, awful, unfunny joke at you.Action scenes are mediocre, nothing extraordinary. Same with plot. The villain-girl was barely shown.Also, Thor (God of Thunder) gets knocked down with a shocker. Just think about this.Overall, just a bad movie. I never want to see it again."
20 November 2017,zardoz-13,4,17,10,Sibling Rivalry Like You've Never Seen!!!,"Chris Hemsworth looks like he had a blast making ""Eagle Vs Shark"" director Taika Waititi's colorful, tongue-in-cheek, superhero saga ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" the third—and best--entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe about the Asgardian God of Thunder. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" shares more in common with director Kenneth Branagh's origins epic ""Thor"" (2011) rather than with Alan Taylor's sequel ""Thor: The Dark World."" Unlike the first and third movies,"" ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) maintained a serious and straightforward tone. Basically, the second ""Thor"" spurned comedy, slaughtered Thor's mom Frigga, and reformed Thor who had behaved like a blowhard. Comparatively, Waititi and his three scenarists, Eric Pearson of ""Marvel One-Shot: Agent Carter,"" Craig Kyle of ""Planet Hulk,"" and Christopher L. Yost of ""Max Steel,"" not only ridicule Thor, but they also challenge the Son of Odin as he has never been tested. Typically, superhero sagas qualify as predictable since you know the hero will vanquish all adversaries and restore order to the cosmos before the end credits. Although the original ""Thor"" was seldom surprising, our hero suffered the consequences of his hopeless arrogance. Odin deprived his son of his supernatural hammer Mjölnir and banished him to Earth without powers. Good movies run their heroes through a gauntlet, and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" pits the God of Thunder against a virtually invincible adversary--his heretofore unknown, elder sister Hela. While she is more than enough to keep him occupied, Waititi and his writers have added the Incredible Hulk. These adversaries keep Thor behind the eight-ball for three-quarters of its swiftly-paced 130 minutes. Thor tangles with enemies for the first time who can withstand the worst he can dish out. Hela ranks as one of his more memorable foes, and two-time Oscar winning Best Actress Cate Blanchett has a field day as Hela. Decked out in a black, dominatrix outfit, this Goth-looking gal resembles Angelina Jolie's ""Maleficent,"" and the antlers that spring from her head before combat make her appear genuinely sinister. When he isn't dodging Hela, Thor tackles the gigantic Hulk in an off-world gladiatorial arena.As ""Thor: Ragnarok"" unfolds, we learn the wicked fire demon Surtur (voice of Clancy Brown) has captured our eponymous hero and plans to execute him. The haughty Surtur informs Thor that Odin no longer sits on the throne of Asgard. Furthermore, he explains that a long, foretold prophecy referred to as 'Ragnarok' with bring about the impending destruction of Thor's planet. Once he plunges his crown into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vault, Sutur boasts that he will conquer Asgard! Trussed up like a turkey fit for a feast, Thor listens to Sutur's boasts until the God of Thunder's wayward hammer homes in on his location like a boomerang. Thor smashes the fire demon's dreams to smithereens. He hastens to Asgard and discovers that his shape-shifting, half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston of ""Kong: Skull Island""), has been impersonating Odin, who has been exiled to Earth. While he awaits death, Odin warns them that his first-born child, Hela (Cate Blanchett of ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age""), will break out of her prison and attack Asgard. Earlier, Odin had incarcerated his daughter because she harbored ambitions far greater and destructive than his own! No sooner has Hela returned to Asgard than she shatters Mjölnir as if it were glass and drives Thor and Loki off. Afterward, Hela eliminates all of Thor's compatriots, while the God of Thunder ends up on the remote planet Sakaar where gladiator combat is the rage.The Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum of ""Independence Day"") rules Sakaar and conducts himself like the Roman Emperor Commodus. Commodus dictated which gladiator would triumph, even if he had to rig the outcome. The Grandmaster has acquired an unrivalled champion in the form of the Incredible Hulk who vanished under mysterious circumstances after the battle at Sokovia in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015). Thor surprises everybody when he clocks Hulk. Previously, nobody left the arena alive after fighting Hulk, but Thor impresses the Grandmaster enough that the tyrant allows him to live. Thor tries to recruit the Hulk to accompany him back to Asgard to overthrow Hela. Scrapper 142 (Tessa Thompson of ""Creed""), the bounty hunter who delivered Thor to the Grandmaster, keeps him restrained with a tazer. Eventually, Thor persuades her to join Hulk and he in a revolt against Sakaar's founder. Further, Thor learns that Scraper 142 was a Valkyrie who fought against Hela and left after nearly dying in battle. Meantime, Hela has lain waste to Asgard, but this doesn't dissuade Thor from returning to rescue his people and then take them to a new homeland. The scenes that depict thousands of Asgardians seeking refuge aboard a space freighter evoke memories of the British Army's evacuation of Dunkirk during World War II.""Thor: Ragnarok"" provides new perspectives on the franchise and exposes a wealth of untold backstory about Odin and Asgard before Thor's birth. The revelation about Odin's bloodlust for the conquest of alien realms makes him appear unsavory rather than avuncular as he appeared in the first two ""Thor"" epics. Hela's clash with the Valkyries resembles an Italian Renaissance painting come to life. A low-budget, little-known independent director, Waititi brings an entirely different vibe to the otherwise hackneyed material. Waititi and his writers rely on humor to give the lead character as well as several supporting characters a greater sense of depth. They have breathed new life into the franchise by cutting Asgard out from under the Thor, exiling Odin, and demolishing Mjölnir. Thor often behaves like a buffoon, and it feels liberating to laugh at his oafish antics. Comparatively, Cate Blanchett radiates a malevolent pugnacity as Odin's first-born who lives to slay. She makes an unforgettable villain. The scenes where she massages her temples and antlers erupt is striking. Hela's comeuppance is as spectacular as it is satisfying. The comic touches in ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may not sit well with some fans who will frown on such shenanigans, but this refreshing irreverence is long-overdue."
26 March 2020,patrikjakopanec,3,6,10,Great fun!!,"By far the best Thor movie. Everything happened in this movie,he lost his eye,mjolnir and cut his hair. Definetily one of the best MCU movies and it was really really funny,absolutely great job from Taika Waititi."
5 November 2017,aallin22,7,13,6,Expected More.,The entire movie was just fishing for funny gags.This movie don't have any creativity just lots of explosions and same story where the good wins over the bad. Just another nonsense story filled with repeated music and cheesy lines. I guess it was meant to be more a comedy rather than an good superhero movie. For me it was just a lot of not so funny little jokes and a lot of big shiny CGI.
30 November 2019,supermaggie,3,8,3,Not a Thor-movie anymore,"My goodness, where do I start? Perhaps with the most tragic thing: this is not a Thor movie. Period. Starting with the obvious: The producers take away Thor's trademark: the great blond mane - we all know what this did with Samson, and for this series it is almost the kiss of death. But unfortunately it was to be expected, because while Hollywood has been continuously discriminating against blonde actresses (and has made Cinderella African-American, Dorothy of Oz a Latina, etcetc.), it recently occupied almost more blond male actors than ever before, but it was only a matter of time that this comes to an end; instead of actually treating everybody equal (with equal advantages and disadvantages for all), whites are successively eliminated and disenfranchised - and this is not propaganda, just the observation of a propaganda taking place - and since they cannot replace the actor for the Nordic God ( naturally and authentically a blond actor) after several films and make him African-American / ... all of a sudden, they can at least cut his hair so short that it looks almost dark. (The fact that at least one blonde actress was cast with Cate Blanchett is good in itself, but more likely due to the New Zealand director than the discretion of Hollywood, and besides, she is allowed to participate only dyed black and portraying the ultimate evil; and in addition: the Valkyrie is hispanic - for real? That's an affront to all the Nordic nations, and if you did that with legends of nations of a different color, there would be rebellions, but you're obviously allowed to do that to white people, because nobody cares, and if they protest and try to defend themselves, they'll wrongfully and inappropriately be called Nazis). And then there is the problem that even with a crop it still remains a handsome blond actor, so he must be mutilated and lose an eye, I guess this is than okay/enough for the time being for today's political Hollywood. The fact that the quality and attraction of the films and the storytelling and the authenticity thereby completely perish does not matter anymore anyway. Only money and political propaganda still count. But that alone does not completely destroy Thor 3 yet. Three Australian and New Zealand actors in the main cast and a New Zealand director - and it turns into a surreal-poor Mad Max - Thunderdome-ish musical, only (fortunately) without singing (and I do like Karl Urban and Cate Blanchett a lot and Chris Hemsworth with hair, but not Mad Max or a Mad Max-Thor Version, respectively). The whole series thus degenerates into a farce and great actors like Jeff Goldblum are degraded to a fool. You can actually spare another Thor movie. Dead and please do not revive, unless again as in the beginning, when the story (and legend) was still worth something."
27 September 2021,qusaymax,11,24,10,this is best thor movie,"Thor ragnarok is one of my favorite thor movie of all time. The humor is funny, in my opinion hela is the best marvel villain. Great fight scenes, great music, best chris hemsworth acting, and it is enjoyable movie."
8 June 2021,joregi,5,11,7,Not bad,"Well It was a very good movie, but not that much, the dialogues were bad and the animation too,, and also what!!!! When he wants to see his father and talk, he just sees him!!!! The jokes were good at first, but it got boring little by little."
2 November 2017,petrovic-nasos,7,12,4,"Once more, a Disney cartoon for Marvel","Since its first movies, Marvel is consistently going for more and more jokes, punchlines and witty remarks, in its movies. Why?They have solid characters, solid scenarios and a ton of money behind each movie. Why do they keep making each character the equivalent of Tony Stark or The Joker, where, no matter the stakes, they have to pull a joke from somewhere? Why don't they let the gravity of the situation weigh in to the viewers and they have to lighten up the mood, every damn minute? Not to mention the number of times one of the characters makes a reference to something, completely out of character, like when Thor says ""Oh my god"", or when they refer to Hell (from the Christian mythology)...Seriously, didn't anyone from the producers read the script and voiced ANY objection???"
29 March 2018,phynigan,3,5,2,What the?,"What's with all the bad jokes and the play...Matt Damon? That was embarassing! WAY too many back references, wasted time. Then there's the music, or I should say lack of it. No real orchestration just synth generated...sad."
22 January 2018,david-689-296408,10,18,1,Unbelievable Spectacle of Ruin to the Thor Franchise,"This is clearly the case of Walt Disney Pictures cashing in on a once very good Marvel franchise.My Wife and I were in total disbelief when we started watching Thor: Ragnarok. We watched for about 30 minutes and then couldn't take it any longer and left the theater.So so sad that they made a joke of and totally disrespected the the Thor character and all that it had become.Also, I cannot believe that this film is getting such good reviews. There must be some conspiracy going on that I'm not apart of, or everyone has become so numb to what a well constructed film should be like.One more beef and I'm done. One of the all time great actors, Anthony Hopkins, is totally disrespected in the sad and uneventful death of his character Odin. REALLY!"
10 July 2018,culmo,3,5,5,I don't get the great reviews,"Perhaps fans of the comic book found something in this, but ... I just don't get it.You'd think the premise of this film--Ranarok, the destruction of Aasgard--would be front and center in this film. Instead, that's more like a side plot. Most of the film takes place on this absurd trash planet ruled over by Jeff Goldblum.Along the way, we see the death of Odin, the introduction of Hela (who should have been a fantastic villain) and the deaths of the warriors 3 (though they get about 5 seconds of screen time before their quick demise). So basically, Thor and Loki get stranded on Jeff Goldblum's planet during a brief fight with Hela. This, after Hela easily destroy's Thor's hammer. Thor is then captured and forced to fight as a gladiator ... against the Hulk, who just so happens to be on this planet after the events of Age of Ultron (something something wormhole on earth that didn't drag anyone else in something something plot needs to tie in other Avengers for Infinity War). Oh and somehow the Hulk has been the Hulk for 2 years ... 
Thor finds out his enslaver is a Valkyrie and he must convince her to help him save Aasgard while also navigating Loki's usual machinations. Anyway, during all this Aasgard is suffering under Hela, who has slaughtered the army, raised an undead army of her own, freed her giant wolf, and is ""getting more powerful"" with each passing day. Meanwhile Heimdall has been helping Aasgardians escape.Therein lies the problem. This was two movies crammed into one and we could have done without the silliness that was Jeff Goldblum's planet. Hela was completely underused. We're told how powerful she is going to become, but we see her easily defeat Thor and Loki in her first few minutes, then she easily annihilates all the soldiers and establishes herself as ruler. It would have been cool to see her powers grow, to actually see her become this formidable foe for Thor. Speaking of Thor, he loses his hammer ... and his hair, then with a fight against Hela later, he loses an eye. Oh and he becomes the true god of Thunder (and lightning), which is supposed to be cool, but it doesn't do much in his fight against Hela.The other problem is how much comedy is injected into this film. For instance, when the Warriors 3 are killed, Karl Urban's character sees this and says ""I'm just a janitor."" Ill-timed comedy completely minimizes the death of these friends of Thor (nevermind they are never mentioned again).
Then, when Aasgard is destroyed, there's some comedic lines ... it should have been a somber moment--seeing the destuction of Aasgard (yeah yeah, I know, Aasgard is a people not a place).I don't know, this film really missed the mark for me."
14 November 2021,jonahsutter,8,20,8,"Very Good Movie, Ignore Bad Reviews","I loved this movie, being an avid Marvel fan. If you are a Marvel fan, don't even bother reading the reviews. Just give it a watch and you won't be disappointed. This movie did a great job storytelling as well as introducing new characters like Korg and Hela. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a little bit less action scenes than the average Marvel movie but this is fine as it takes more time to explain the plot and introduce characters."
15 November 2017,gmwatling,3,6,7,Outstanding,"Firstly sorry for the huge gap from this post to the last post, but without further ado. Thor: Ragnarok is a neon-infused delusion of what superhero films could look like. There are massive monsters and attractive women; zombie armies and a large unearthly dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just an additional film to add to the already amazing set of Thor films. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise has always been. It takes a character that could have always been more as people and audiences have said about Thor, sure he is a god who can destroy basically anything and everything with his Mjölnir (his hammer)but viewers have said that there is more to Thor than is being shown on screen and that's what is shown in Ragnarok. Marvel have kept to their promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world that it will. This is exactly the type of reward that audiences expected to receive from this film. The vibrancy of the scenes and the DVD cover it attracts and compels the audience to look further into the scene and draws the audience eye every which way and keeps the audience drawn in at every moment, thus never losing their attention for a moment.

3 November 2017,bendikselvaaghagen1,9,15,5,Laughing away emotion.,"I am not the one to write a lot of reviews, but this film bugged me a lot. Mainly the theme of it. This review do contain spoilers.As a fair warning, I am not very into the franchise, but have seen some of the films of the franchise and I do find the best ones to be entertaining. But due to my displeasing experiences with some of the titles, I may be a little biased.The setup of this movie seems somewhat chaotic, with the defeat of Saart (?), the situation at Aasgard and my confusion with the character of Loke. We get no time to have it all established before we chameos from another series, Odins death and the introduction and success of Hel, the main villain, which based on the mythology, which I know far better than the cinematic and cartoon universe, is the daughter of Loke. Further than this I will not comment on the plot. It follows the textbook sequence in the following two acts which ends in the demise of the villain, and the source of a new problem. Safe and easy way to make a movie.My main issue with this movie, except the villains army (which as in every installation of the series is just expendable ""badass"" inseparable spawn), is the emotion of it. Most movies contain emotional value, where you feel for the decision the characters you root for take. This is the only thing keeping us attached to these heroes which normally have no human-like features, except feeling. Every time the movie tries to be emotional, you get some cheap slapstick line from the at least two comic relief characters. It's just lazy. When making a decision you have to feel the impact it does on the characters who acts, not chuckle over a cheap joke from our fellow Rastafarian sidekick. It seems as the movie tried to keep a light tone over the whole movie, but ruining literally every moment of emotion in a movie, makes it quite unbearable to watch to my. I now have no sympathy for anyone due to their emotional involvement in their home world being destroyed is dulled down by our clumsy Jamaican rock stepping on his bug-buddy. Cheap, lazy and bad film writing.If you rely solely on the few moments of feeling I suspect must have occurred in previous installments, and keep riding on that, as well as Chris Hemsworths charisma and charms. I am not impressed."
21 October 2017,aleksandrk07,30,68,7,Review\Rant,"I will not give away any spoilers or anything, just will give my impression of the movie. The movie is definitely entertaining, the main and supporting cast are doing well. Tone wise movie is far too light for what Ragnarok stands for. And you never really worry for any of the main cast, at least I did not. The feeling was similar to watching a cartoon - colors, action, dialogues not too heavy on the words, moments of build up and joy, moments of emptiness. Movie earns a 7/10 and a solid one. Now for the rant: Can IMDb stop letting accounts with less than 1 week after registration period post reviews? First review I've read, prior to writing my own, was a Bulgarian guy giving movie a 10/10 (movie has flaws). Guy has no other ratings, review or anything. Accounts is 2 days old. So I decided to check other 10/10 reviews - all fresh accounts, made on the day of the premier or just now. Isn't this suspicious? The ratings can also go both ways. Just I don't want any of fake publicity shadow other people's opinions, including my own. I am more than sure no one watched this movie and said to himself/herself ""Hey, I must go on IMDb, make an account and review this!"". This is not that kind of movie, you will get same emotions as you've received from the trailer, to put it short. Nothing special :D"
1 January 2019,philberry-84387,2,2,8,Confused...,Just alittle confused as to how Thor can be the god of thunder and produce electricity through the movie and shoot lighting from his fingertips yet be controlled through almost the entire movie by being shocked with electricity from a little device.......
7 November 2017,cky-chengkeyi,11,21,9,I love Thor more now!!,"This is a great movie that totally change the atmosphere of Thor movie series. I like how it was before but I LOVE it more when it changes.Since a lot of people reviewed about the scenes, humor, and music, I will focus more about the character development in my review. Thor: Ragnarok made a huge and successful renovation on its main character, Thor. In Thor 1&2 and Avengers 1&2, Thor is more like an old-fashion alien, saying some word that sounds like lines from an old classic book. Now in this movie, he finally found his happy, dynamic and energetic soul. He is no longer a flat icon as a handsome prince, a dignified throne heir, a powerful hero, and a sweet lover. He is a warm, charming big boy who always carries a shinning smile on face and joke around. He is still the God of Thunder in a less mighty version, which made him more alike human being. No matter how great he is, he has some cute childhood memory as everyone else. He has issues with his sibling too. When facing to enemy, he is still the fearless warrior. But when he turns to his brother and friends, he is a little bit clumsy and nervous who cares about his relationships with them. In this movie, I eventually felt Thor is real. He is no longer wearing a fake mask with those labels given by his father, his co-worker, his kingdom, and even Jane. He is an elder brother who needs to carefully deal with his witty younger brother and a man who has to negotiate with Hulk and new friend, Valkyrie, to get things done. He also talks, laughs and plays jokes with them as a normal people. Chris Hemsworth finally had a chance to be more himself in Thor and gave the latter a new soul.Tom Hiddleston did a great job as Loki as always. As Thor is changing, Loki is growing too. Although he seems much weaker in fighting, he is stronger from inside to face to his pass and his family. He used to degrade himself as a frost giant and avoid to accept the fact. Now he even put his own story in a play and shown to all Asgardian. He listened to his father who calls him son. He helped his brother who believe in him and love him after all the troubles he had made. He cares about Asgardian as a part of this realm and return as a savior. He finally realized and gained his real goal, not king's crown but applause from his father, attention from people, and an equality from his brother. Now parents are gone. People need their new king and leaders. His elder brother is his last family who finally accept him as is and promise will never force him to change. Loki has been set free and he can make his own choices. He chose to return to Asgardian and Thor. These brotherhood is so touching to me at this moment: We might be mad with our family, but still support each other's back in needs. Hulk, not Bruce Banner, starts to show more characteristics in this movie too. This green giant talks, plays and makes friends. He is not a beast but more like a child with uncontrollable power who starts to learn some manner. These new layers made him more lovely.I also like Cate Blanchett's Hela and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. They all did a very good job to bring more fresh blood to this series. Now I am well prepared and cannot wait to watch the coming one, Avengers: Infinity War!!"
26 May 2022,bretttaylor-04022,2,5,6,7.9 seriously. A 10 out of 10 movie for people who have not seen many other films.,Overrated. Marvels only purpose is to churn out expensive filler and make more money than they spend. Are people going to be saying how amazing this is in 60 years time?The whole thing feels like an expensive 90s music video complete with a villan straight from Shakespears Sister. It's just full of irritating quips.Thors people are in exile and they are just making stupid quips.It's entertaining and that is it.
15 November 2017,Carycomic,2,6,8,"Well, I finally got a chance to see this! So, where to begin?","Surtur's dungeon, I guess. With no montage to back it up, Thor tells this long-dead skeleton how he wound up in chains inside a glorified bird cage. And the back- story is a little vague; referencing a search for something called the ""Infinity Stones.""Hearing this, I thought to myself: ""Say what?! What installment did I miss in this franchise?""But, I quickly forgot that in all my excitement over the opening battle! Which, by the way, was fought to the tune of Led Zeppelin's famous Wagnerian pastiche (""ah-ah-ahhhhhh!"" and all). But, then came the first of several surprises.Heimdall; replaced as Bifrost gatekeeper by a low-rent Viking named Skurge?Loki; posing as a suddenly--and uncharacteristically--hedonistic Odin?And the real Odin: somehow rendered amnesiac and then marooned on Earth (perhaps as an adviser to stranded Autobots)?What the heck is going on, here?????It turns out to be a Machiavellian ploy by Odin to deal with the coming of Hela, ""goddess of death."" In this film, she is not depicted as Loki's daughter (and, therefore, Thor's niece) as she is in classical Norse mythology. Rather, she is Thor's long-lost older sister! And, boy, is she p****d off. Killing Thor's three favorite warrior companions (blond Fandral, redheaded Voltstagg, and Lapp/Sami-like Hogun the Grim) with almost laughably easy speed, she makes Skurge her personal executioner. A deal he soon regrets accepting!Thor's ultimate show-down with them (including a reprise of Led Zeppelin) is capped off by a desperate gamble that's equal parts Trojan Horse and ""Hail, Mary"" play. The ploy succeeds, of course. But, at a terrible price.And, no; it's not the death of Jane Foster! Apparently, she's already dumped the ""god of thunder"" before the movie even begins. No in- story reason given. The real-life reason was probably casting unavailability on Natalie Portman's part. In any case, I deducted one star for her absence.I deducted another star for turning the Grandmaster from a blue- skinned, nearly omnipotent Elder of the Universe...into an anorexic-looking version of that Roman fop from GLADIATOR. The one who tried kissing Joaquin Phoenix's butt with that ""Battle of Carthage"" fiasco?In short; this is a pleasantly action-packed little time-killer on its own merits (as with the first two Thor films before it). But, with regard to being integral to the cinematic saga of the Avengers, as a whole? Not really. Not unless the opening scenes of their next flick serves as prequel to the opening scene of this one!"
15 November 2017,MogwaiMovieReviews,3,10,3,The Golden Age of Marvel Movies May Be On The Wane,"After the success of Deadpool and Guardians Of The Galaxy (both fine, fun, movies, by the way) the magic of Marvel - i.e, believable characters you care about in unbelievable situations, with a unique balance of gripping drama, action and lively humour - seems to be tipping more and more into only humour. In doing so, they risk losing what made them so special in the first place. I noticed this recently in the noisy and chaotic mess that was Spiderman Homecoming, and the flimsiness of the technically dazzling Dr Strange.The new Thor movie is another step in that direction, and the most obviously unbalanced. This wouldn't necessarily be that big a deal if they could somehow make the comedy seem natural extension of the characters and believable, but they fall down quite majorly here too: I didn't recognize Cate Blanchett until the closing credits, which is strange, since I'm quite I'm a fan of her, but she seems out of sorts here and unable to maintain a convincing tone for her character who remains not the least bit godlike throughout. At no point in the movie does she successfully personify the death of all things but rather a bitchy soccer mom at a class reunion.None of the familiar characters talk or act anything like how we remember them - Odin is gone in the blink of an eye and his death means nothing. Loki is completely wasted and does nothing at all Loki-like. Thor himself has gone from being a dazzling manifestation of an ancient, otherworldly GOD to... just being a big doofus, really. And there was no reason at all for that god-damned haircut, by the way, which only works against the believability of the character even more.The Hulk, too, goes from being the ultimate depiction of unstoppable force in human form to ALSO being... well, just a big doofus too. No reason is given for why he does not revert to Banner when he has calmed down enough to bounce a ball around or get in a hot tub, and he holds lengthy Abbot & Costello-like comedic conversations in a manner he hasn't in 50 years of comic books. There's nothing to identify him as a character: if you swopped the CGI covering him for one of the other brightly coloured and slow-witted alien monsters, you'd never know it was him.The central tragedies at the heart of all these characters - which, after all, define them - are here almost completely excised, along with the gravity of the thousands and thousands of deaths of the Asgardians. Some long-recurring characters are literally in the film for 10 seconds or so before being killed, but there's no space made for the mourning needed to make such an event resonate and matter, and by the end of the film it's as if none of it ever happened. All this unbelievable loss of life, and yet at every turn, every scene is played for laughs.Ultimately, the film plays like a satire of the film you actually paid to see - it's a little like going to see the new Star Trek movie and finding it to actually be Galaxy Quest. This was great for Guardians Of The Galaxy and Deadpool, but tonally way out of balance for a tragic family saga of ancient gods.Don't get me wrong, a bunch of it IS fun, it's just fun that doesn't make any sense, hang together as a story, or mean anything. Yes, it's a colourful and frothy space romp, and there's stuff within that to be enjoyed. But next time, more care and depth and a decent script, please."

16 December 2021,marcusliuhk,4,7,8,"Funny, slightly let downed but overall amazing","So first of all, it's directed by an interesting director, which allows actor to fully show their true colors within the movie, therefore some funny scenes were created which are some good points to contribute towards a higher rating.So the story, it's nice, it's alright, covering how thor got his new weapon and a throwback to the heila storyline which is a good thing to understand thor's background.However, a very disaapointing scene was when odin passed away. This is absolutly madness, in the comics Odin is being portrated as a mighty, like real mighty asgardian that even keeps some super strong villain force at bay from invading the nine realms.

Thor's sister is woman version of Aku, fighting in exact same way, even with same number of fangs on head. Thor got sword and performs same things as Jack does in every episode - finds himself in a bad place, fights for life, helps other, fights more, gets help from people he helped, saves everyone in one ship (one of Jack's biggest trick - pack whole people in a single small transport) and watches grim but hopeful end."
4 November 2017,rboswell-80105,10,17,4,Thor RagnaNot,"I'm suspicious when there's weeks and weeks of promotional hype before a film constantly reminding me how much I'll like the film. True enough, the trailers were epic and noteworthy. I can't say the same about Ragnarok. I get it that Marvel wanted to shake things up with some humor, but there's a limit to how much humor can be shoved into a scene. Or many scenes. Anyway, Ragnarok seemed to drag out a short story to a little over two hours painfully trying to convince me how dire the situation was with Hela and the imminent destruction of Asgard. Dr. Strange's appearance was .. strange. Short. A waste of using him in a near non-sequitur. Cate Blanchett rocks the Hela character. She made Death gorgeous, catty, bitter and looking fabulous. I was hoping for something more wicked, darker, after all she is the Goddess of Death. The character got lost though in lots of chatter and stand and pose. Several instances pop up that pose questions, like how did Hulk manage to talk so much, and how did he, in all his green anger, seem to be sexy? Why? Jeff Goldblum as Grand Master is downright annoying and campy. But maybe that's the whole point, and if it is, it was a great distraction from what this film was supposed to be about. And what was what, again? .. I forget... Anyway, good for entertainment, worst of the Thor films so far."
29 December 2020,ZiKJH,5,10,8,About the movie,"The movie is about Thor and Loke which turns out to have a syster whom is first born in their family, therefore the syster have a lot more power. Loke's and Thor's father have locked the syster in because she was to dangerous and had Valhall put in danger. It turns out that the hometown Valhall is where the people of valhall is, and not the place itself. At the begginning of the movie the viewers where presented by a huge fire monster. This creature is the key to the whole movie, as this creature will be the one that defeats Thor's and Loke's syster after they released this creature in Valhall with the eternal flame. Loke and Thor continue and flies away in a ship. Movie ends."
24 January 2018,vazgav,3,5,4,Could have been much better,"First off the CGI in this movie looks to dull, being a huge film, they could have worked on it for a better output. The sound track ""Led Zeppelin's - Immigrant Song"" is over used. The story is down right trash, everyone living from Hella's time is dead or left Asgard ?. Its like no one knows Thor has an older sister who is all powerful and that she can over come Odin with her power because sometime in the past Odin betrayed her by locking her up. Hulk/Banner how does he reach the planet in Quin Jet its like an actual jet plane that can cross the universe by entering a worm-hole which no scientist bothered to monitor and most importantly a jet in space where no air exist to allow the jet engines to function. Thor can discharge Lightning and turn you to ash but you can electrocute him while he has his powers and call him sparkles. 1st movie where his powers were stripped and he got zapped it made sense but with his powers he still gets zapped ???There is way to much unwanted comedy in this movie, forcing joke after joke and its repeated the way it put in the dialogue too for eg: Spider-man (2002) when he gets his abilities and goes to fight in the ring which turns into a cage match, the announcer ask Peter what are you called he says ""the Human Spider"". Thor Ragnarok same is done by saying ""Lord of Thunder"" recycled/re-hashed. Literally the funny parts are mostly in the trailers and TV Spots.This movie is for hardcore movie Marvel and Thor fans, the Stanlee's Appearance can stop now its no longer fun. Hella is so easily defeated at the end of the movie its ridiculous, most of the action in the movie is during the immigrant song that the beginning and during the final fight scene at the end. Thor is not a playful character Loki is, he is the God of Mischief. This appeal to teens girls more than boys for sure.Pretty sure if this movie was made by anyone else it would be called a disaster. The branding is done well to make flops very successful. Lastly Hella is amazing they could have fleshed her out more with 2 maybe 3 films."
8 July 2018,sandgrainday,2,3,6,too entertainment-ish,"First of all, I like this movie, I enjoyed it while watching it. My lower-than-average rating is because this movie is not as good as I hope it to be. The filmmakers give up developing interesting storylines, instead they decide to cater for children and dimwit adults (such as me), and make it a movie of two-dimensional characters smashing things.Thor and Loki seem to have had some mutual influence on each other. Thor has become more trickster-like. He stole from Valkyrie in order to free himself and other prisoners; he told Hulk he preferred Hulk rather than Banner, then later told Banner he preferred Banner rather than Hulk; he was able to detect Loki's every attempted deception. I guess in a way Thor is integrating the Jungian shadow (yes, I am pretending to be a pseudo-intellectual). And Loki has become less enthusiastic about killing everyone and ruling the world, (that role has been passed on to Hela). Loki has taken on some responsibilities as an Asgardian prince. He came back to Asgard to help save their citizens and took part in the fight against Hela.So, out of Odin's three children, two of them are mass murderers, I have to say there really is something wrong with Odin and Frigga's parenting."
15 November 2017,capt_sparrow,10,18,5,An Entertaining Identity Crisis,"Thor: Ragnarok is a perfect example of a sad trend I'm seeing in the film industry; it's a movie that shoots for strictly what will sell, which are cheap laughs, quick one-liners, overly simplistic plots and characters, and a refusal to allow for serious moments in any character story or just in general. The story is decent enough, bursting with potential, as it deals with the destruction of Thor's world. This might have worked had the film been made in the vein of the past two Thor movies, but alas, it was not to be. Thor's character is not the warrior we've seen him grow into, but rather a happy go lucky wise cracker. It's disappointing that marvel decided to throw all the work they'd done on creating a strong warrior king character, whom they don't have anywhere else in their cinematic universe, simply to attempt to make a funnier movie. Thor still manages to have his moment of growth at the end of the film, but it's hardly believable after the hour and a half of him cracking jokes and trying to be a comedian. The film, as much as the character of Thor, has an identity crisis. It appears that marvel is trying to strike with the Guardians of the Galaxy lightning a second time, never mind that it didn't even work out that well for GotG vol 2. As I said, if the film had been made in the vein of first two films, it really could have worked out well. But instead, it tries to cover almost every serious moment with humor - apart from Odin's death, and Thor's realization of who he is and the hero he's capable of being. But even those are sandwiched between attempted jokes, and feel extremely out of place. The villain, Hela, has potential but between her idiotic wisecracking (why would the goddess of death make such funny comments?) and her rather lame fighting scenes cuts down the impact she could have had. Usually it's the heroes beating a bunch of CGI enemies to a pulp, but this time it's the villain beating a bunch of CGI good guys to a pulp. Same lame effect. She meets a predictable demise, and is likely going to become a villain who is forgotten by the next marvel flick. Side characters do their best to try to save the movie, especially Loki. He seems to be the one character who hasn't lost his identity. He's still the God of mischief, but he continues the arc that he started in the first one of being a tortured soul who longs for that which he knows he cannot have - the throne of Asgard. He's always tried come off as not caring about anyone but himself, and while that's still true to some extent, he has moments where he chooses to risk his life for others rather than just himself, and when he chooses to be the hero, it comes off far more convincing than Thor's own hero moment. He provides some of the best laughs in the film, as well as some of the strongest serious moments. Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster is ridiculous, but is probably the only character who actually fits in the movie, and he's another character who manages to provide some genuine humor. Hulk has apparently turned into a rock star, able to control his moods as Hulk, never mind what we've seen in every other marvel movie he's been in. Bruce Banner is out of place in the movie, and he knows it. Valkyrie has a compelling story, but it's drowned in more forced humor, and when she decides out of the blue to make the heroic choice, it was expected because it made since to push the story along to its inevitable climax, but there was nothing earlier in the movie to justify it. She's a pathetic substitute for the Warriors 3 and Lady Sif, the former who are all killed in extremely unnecessary and idiotic fashion, and the latter whom is absent altogether. It's sad to see them wasted after building the characters over the last two Thor movies. Even something as simple as the them song in the movie - The Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin - feels out of place, an attempt to be another Guardians of the Galaxy. This is another movie that will undoubtedly be a huge success for marvel, both financially and somehow critically, and will give them even more reason to make another half ass-ed movie that gets cheap laughs and hits all of the notes required to make a blockbuster hit, but manages to avoid doing anything that's actually meaningful to the film industry."
18 March 2019,Miasmakoala,3,7,3,I miss the first Iron Man,"Back in 2008 Iron Man felt really a fresh breath on the blockbusters. It adopted its source material really faithfully in the vein of big budget action adventure movies. Despite the predictableness, the movies was really funny and it was fun to see the good guy smash the bad guy in the end. Good laugh and a fun to behold. Iron Man 2 was nothing special and Iron Man 3 is a whole review of its own.The Thor trilogy, however, is really just sad, wasted opportunity.First Thor was so dull and bland. It was the most obvious setup for the Avengers in phase one and felt nothing more than a paycheck for everyone involved. The Dark World absolutely wasted the great Christopher Ecclestone, I really wish they'd given the opportunity for him to get his thing going on with Chris Hemsworth in their scenes. Instead of this, they decided it'd be better to reduce him to nothing more than a dull joke.They went all in the dull jokes in Ragnarok. This movie is just the mediocrity of the Dark World combined with Guardians colour palette and jokes, endless amount of unfunny jokes. The plot is yet again the old ""something wants to destroy everything, main character must discover the way to prevent this"", and the few serious scenes trying to explain this conflict feel awkward among the swarm of clunky dick jokes.The few scenes where they let Tessa Thompson, Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth just talk to each others like normal people do, the movie feels real and funny. Those scenes are very few, most of the time everything is interrupted with a really awkward joke. Idris Elba was awesome, but Heimdall feels so weird in this movie. He's super serious when everyone else isn't. Anthony Hopkins' line delivery was the funniest part of the film.There's something wrong with practically every character (except for Loki, I guess). Hela stabs Thor and gouges his eye (the makeup is so ugly), but she mumbles when she has to talk about executor executing people. Ha ha. Skurge is maybe the most worthless character in the whole series. Thor ranges from being a childish idiot to a hero of the day who cheats his brother, who's supposed to be a trickster god or something. Valkyrie being a badass drunk doesn't feel real at all. Surtur looks like a PS3 cutscene. The Warriors Three get treated like they weren't ever there in the previous movies. Jeff Goldblum plays himself in this movie. Hulk's voice sounds like its completely unfinished, I had to check that my speakers were working normally. Korg is probably Taika Waititi's final middle finger to the audiences and the producers.The bigger these movies get, the smaller these stories go. Some Marvel movies feel like the directors want to make adventure movies, but the producers want to make children's movies. These movies are starting to feel really weird. Everything shown is told to the viewer by the characters. Literally everything.Thor Ragnarok is probably the Schindler's List for people who paid to see all the Transformers movies.This was almost as bad, lazy and uninspired as Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I'll add rate this one star higher for the slightly better actors and some nice looking green screens and special effects.Can't wait for the next reboot in 10-20 years."
29 September 2019,billking6666,3,7,2,This was a joke and most reviewers saw it as such.,"Thor is a character that I grew up with. Stan and Jack created him and developed him, from Norse Mythology. This Thor and Asgard is a far cry from the comics (graphic novels) I read, as a kid. I will admit they managed to recreate the majesty the Kirby portrayed with CGI. Things like the rainbow bridge and the way Thor would spin his hammer. So many other things were flat wrong though. Spoiler Alert: Things like taking his eye out, cutting his hair (shame on Stan!) and the idea that Hela was Thor's sister, heir to the throne and decided to kill everyone. Odin died? Odin never died. He would retire to what was known as the ""Odinsleep"", which he could not be awakened from under any circumstances, which made an excellent plot foundation for the true Marvel Ragnarok series (lasted quite a few issues). Destroying the beauty of Asgard and sticking the refugees in Norway was sad and pathetic. Disney has no concept of thinking ahead. There was so much more to Asgard than the tiny role it was given in the Marvel movies thus far. Like the Gods, immortal Asgardians and the location, it was supposed to be eternal. There are countless adventure where Asgard could have played a central role. Marvel killed the Golden Goose with this picture."
14 October 2021,spj-74594,9,21,10,Just Imagine,OMG! What a Movie! What a Combination Between Marvel Comics.... It's Really Amazing.... Thor Ragnarok Absolutely Magnificent.... I love This Movie. I Love Chris Hemsworth.... My Favourite Hero.... Waiting For Thor Love And Thunder.😉😉😉
7 November 2017,mysto-81375,12,22,10,Marvelistic,The best marvel movie so far. The film is filled with action and comedy. The catch of the movie will be the humour which happens at the most unexpected timings.As you might have seen from the trailer Thor gets a new look and it suits him especially because of the story-line. Make sure you stick around till the post credits scene.
30 August 2018,jcrobertsxii,9,15,1,The MCU film that broke me,"It's been a long road for me these past 10 years, keeping up with all these random MCU films for better or worse. With such a diverse set of characters, concepts, and settings, I guess it was always inevitable that this would be a franchise where the movies would either be great, terrible, or somewhere in between. Personally, my favorite has always been the first Thor film. My least favorite has always been Guardians of the Galaxy. In other words, I'm clearly in a specific minority in the MCU's audience. All the same, regardless of the film or its quality, I felt I could always take consolation in one thing: that I would always love Chris Hemsworth as Thor and that I could always count on him to just be the good old-fashioned God of Thunder that I knew and loved.How wrong I was. That cozy myth was completely shattered for me after watching Thor: Ragnarok. I had always known in the back of my mind that there were a number of tiny little things about the MCU and its overall execution that bothered me, but this was a film that took all those flaws, made them exponentially larger and more noticeable, and placed them on a big, shiny pedestal for everyone to see. At first, my biggest concern for the MCU was that all of its future standalone hero films would just be wastes of time like Antman or Dr. Strange; in other words, mindless clones of the first Iron Man. Ragnarok, of course, has given me a bigger concern: that sooner or later, all of these films, regardless of their type, will just be mindless clones of Guardians and all the protagonists will just be red-clad quip machines like Tony Stark, Peter Quell, Antman, Dr. Strange, Spiderman, etc.. Can't a guy say he's had enough?As biased as I may be, I still feel that Ragnarok, even on the technical level, is a flat-out terrible film. Besides the fact a dead serious warrior demigod clearly wouldn't completely change his personality overnight to that of a guffawing, blonde-haired Jar Jar Binks for no reason, the movie suffers from a multitude of other problems as well. First off, objectively speaking, the events of the film include Thor's father dying, his three best friends getting killed, his hammer getting smashed to pieces, his right eye getting torn out, and his home-world getting blown to smithereens. Also objectively speaking, practically none of the characters ever acknowledge these events; they just drunkenly stagger from scene-to-scene, improvising idiotic, irrelevant dialogue, and generally trying way too hard to treat the movie like a comedy instead of an epic tragedy.Unfortunately, as Taika Waititi so painstakingly proves, you really can't make something this dark, terrible, and traumatizing into a comedy. The incessant stabs at cutesy or inappropriate humor at unfitting moments gets really old, really fast, especially when more than half of all these forced jokes involve either contrived slapstick or references to sex or genitalia. Arguably, the true tragedy here is a movie that's supposed to be a comedy, but didn't once make me laugh or smile during its two-hour runtime. All I could do was sit there staring at the screen, wondering if the movie was trying to be funny, serious, both, or neither?All the characters in a nutshell:Surtur-Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs as a towering devil creature. Surely his member is the biggest, most flaming one of them all, yet Thor makes no mention of it. Talk about a HUGE missed opportunity.
Hulk-While I do appreciate Hulk finally being a character for once (and not just a big green deus ex machina), why DOES the sight of his anatomy upset Thor so much? I get that you're ""trying to be funny"", Thor, but you've been all over the galaxy, you've seen far bigger, veinier things on bigger monsters multiple times; get over it.
The Grandmaster-Jeff Goldblum as himself in an MCU film... and he has an orgy ship... and a big portal in the sky of his world called ""the Devil's Anus"". Clever stuff.
Valkyrie-An apathetic, knife-wielding broad with a drinking problem. So... Tony Stark and Gamora rolled into one? Clever stuff.
Hela-A generically evil woman who somehow gets far less screen-time and character development than Jeff Goldblum... even though he's not the main enemy. Girl power!!
Scourge-Yet another vehicle for contrived jokes that adds shockingly little to the story. Are we really supposed to feel anything when he dies shooting a bunch of cgi skeletons in the face with a couple of assault rifles? Was that supposed to be funny too? I'm so confused.
Korg-The insensitive clod that makes fun of Asgard being blown to kingdom come while its once-proud people look on in sorrow. Yeah, this guy is SOOOOOOOOO funny.
Miek-Korg's simple-minded, cgi best friend. Unfortunately, the only thing he ever says is, ""I am Miek."" Spoiler alert: he dies at the end, but also miraculously survives.Having said that, there are plenty of other grievances I have with this film (like the main plot of Asgard's endangerment and the subplot of Planet Hulk literally having nothing to do with each other), but I think you get the idea. I wanted to see Thor going through this dark chapter in his life as exactly that-a dark chapter in his life. Instead, I got Chris Hemsworth skipping around everywhere and giggling like a little girl for two hours straight, falling over himself and talking about how he always wanted to be a woman... all while his family, friends, and homeland get torn to bloody shreds all around him.To Thor: Ragnarok, I give 1/10 stars for singlehandedly ruining Thor's character and, by extension, the entire MCU. I now understand how utterly pointless it is to pay attention to what exactly any of these characters are; sooner or later, they'll all devolve into uncreative, cackling zombie clones of Tony Stark and Peter Quell. And that's just not funny."
2 November 2017,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,2,5,6,A descent into total collective madness,"There is an unprecedented general approval of MCU movies without any regard for how good these movies actually are. In all fairness some of them are truly brilliant (Avengers, Winter soldier, Iron man, Guardians of the galaxy), and some of them are just, in lack of a better word, bad (Incredible hulk, Ant-Man). In the last couple of years we have been served with extremely bland and generic action movies that lack any grit, power or, in some cases, story (Doctor Strange, Guardians of the galaxy 2, Spider-man Homecoming, Civil war). All of these movies are fun, the time spent watching them is extremely fun. But, regarding the historic importance of the cinematic universe importance (and the fact that no one so far has managed to do the same even though attempts are being made), is fun and entertaining all you aspire to? Herein enters Thor: Ragnarok.The trailers boiled ones blood. The adrenaline of the music, visuals and characters blew one away and you simply couldn't wait to see it. The end result was a question: ""What happened to the movie the trailer promised?""Let's break it down a bit.1) Story. There are several actually, and not one of them makes any sense. The Surthur story is seen in the beginning and the end of the movie, destroying one of the most powerful characters in Norse mythology/Marvel comics. The Hela story is underwritten, shabby in execution and a waste of a spectacular character (played beautifully by Blanchett). The gladiator story is a disaster in every possible way. The irrelevance of the story or unprecedented, the way it slows down the progression of the Hela story is just criminal. So, the viewer is presented with multiple ongoing stories that do not have any relevance in regard to each other, they are stuffed together without any real idea of how to execute them. The result is that the story we were promised was never actually given to us.2) The humor. That lighthearted approach to every situation, no matter how dark or difficult it is, that Marvel has been doing lately (e.g. Civil war), has in this case actually killed the movie (Civil war does have a redeeming ending that is as dark and gritty as it needs to be). Comedic segments serve as wonderful relief in many ways. In horror movies, if implemented correctly, can be a great layer to the whole experience (e.g. IT). In dramas they can create mixed emotions in viewers so that they actually laugh instead of cry. The key - IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY. Ragnarok not only overused comedic elements, it used them in all the wrong places. So, when one is supposed to feel sorrow - laugh; when on is supposed to feel excited or filled with adrenaline - laugh etc. etc. etc. There was only one moment in the entire movie that was relieved of the humor - the bridge and main fight scene between Thor and Hela. But, even in the very end when all hell breaks loose (literally), we can't fathom the gravity of the situation because yet another character dropped a pun or a joke. So, enough is enough, really.3)The portrayal of characters. So, all of the above can be blamed on bad direction (the terrible way of telling the story and not knowing how and when to interlock certain story segments) or bad screenplay (humor EVERYWHERE). But, the way the characters were portrayed was unbelievable. At the end of the movie one thing is certain: this movie was made just to depict where Thor and Hulk were during the events of the Civil war. Why and how certain story segments occurred - no answer. The criminally underused Antony Hopkins, the lack of screen time for Blanchett or Elba (the only actor that took his role seriously, God bless him), the absolutely unnecessary Dr. Strange cameo or Karl Urban's forgettable and cliché character just proves that bundling together too many characters that have no relevance to the story(stories in this case) doesn't make it fun or good in any way.All in all, Thor: Ragnarok just continues the general downfall Marvel movies have established. The once brilliant concept of a shared cinematic universe is now a money making machine that has no real idea of where it is going or how it is going to end. At one point it will have to end, my concern is do the executives know that. I was really excited for Infinity wars, now I am just scarred to death they are going to do the same thing they did to all of the movies in the last couple of years.Congratulations, enjoy a bland action movie, have a great laugh to the end of the world, because that's what the end of everything (Ragnarok) should feel like - lighthearted"
24 June 2019,silvermistvio,2,8,9,It's great except for one little thing.,"After I watched this film, I just have a question. Is it necessary to have Thor blind in one eye?Yeah, that is the sad part that Thor is now blind in one eye. I feel like it's kind of unnecessary to let him. And no offence but one eyed Thor is ugly. I don't like it.Except for this fact, this film is really great and I've totally enjoyed it."
22 January 2018,iamjustme-54523,6,10,1,Its a don't bother wathing to me..,"Marvel fan all my life and really looked forward to this. The problem is that is more of a spoof that an actual movie. Imagine Spielberg making the first star wars, then the 2nd star wars.. then Spielberg promising a 3rd star war but giving you space balls instead. That's this film in a nut shell.. kind of like an Ernest goes to Asgard kind of thing. Not a bad comedy but a movie that makes fun of itself..."
11 November 2017,DKosty123,2,12,8,Great Well-Scripted Marvel Film - And Lots of Fun,"Another film from the Disney-Marvel-Lee team and this one is lots of fun. What is really interesting is that Thor loses his hammer quite early in this one and goes through most of the movie without it. The film is quite faithfully written from the Stan Lee Marvel franchise.Visually, the film is magnificent. The filming locales in Australia look great and somehow the Atlanta, Georgia ones are fit in too. There is once again a lot of humor and fun mixed in with the battles and special effects. Chris Hemsworth(is back) makes a solid Thor even after his hair cut. Tom Hiddleston is back as Loki. Cate Blanchett is the ultimate evil sister Hela. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie kind of appears like a drunken warrior but by the end this one, I loved what she did here. Jeff Goldblum is a riot as the Grandmaster.I really could go through the whole cast this way, but perfect casting by the team who put this one together is really here. Stan Lee does not make an unaccredited cameo here which has been common in Marvel films recently, but the great spirit of the Lee creations continue to be well defined in this movie.As usual, stay through the credits to get some bonus material. Long run it appears these Marvel films will be the ones this generation will look at as classics. The great thing is you can put your brain away and just enjoy the show, and the way the chemistry of the script and the cast come together to be very entertaining."
24 October 2017,ulyssesgammahose,10,31,8,Same old cookie-cutter Marvel stuff...,"Ultimately, it's like most of the Marvel movies; slick but shallow, doesn't take it self seriously, and full of obligatory CGI fight scenes with no real impact. Ragnarok basically throws in all the great stuff from the Thor comics that haven't been used yet, pays lip service to them, and then makes a mockery of the whole thing. Hulk fighting Thor? Has no impact because it's all so comedic. It's just empty spectacle. The whole movie is like that.So much here is wasted. Heimdall (Idris Elba looks like he didn't even want to be there). Cate Blanchett. Odin. Skurge. The Fenris Wolf. Surtur. Planet Hulk. The whole Ragnarok myth is reduced to not very much. All sacrificed at the alter of constant, silly gags.If you want some dumb, silly, spectacular entertainment, it's passable, but Thor: Ragnarok is a terrible waste of potential and great source material."
23 March 2018,WeAreLive,1,3,10,"A billion times better then Planet Hulk, Thor, Thor Dark Worlds and The Incredible Hulk put together","This movie is truly an amazing experience to have especially if you are watching it in 4D. Both me and my dad went to see it at the Cinema on a Friday night and we both enjoyed it.Thor Ragnarok is definitely a fun film for both kids and adults to watch. The effects were awesome.The acting was good.The story was amazing. The best scenes are when Thor fights Surter (Clancy Brown) at the beginning of the movie, the fight scene with Thor and the Hulk and the final battle especially since we see Hulk fight a wolf. Overall awesome movie if you haven't seen it yet. Stop reading my review and go watch it."
8 November 2017,mingyizou,13,25,4,"Thor Ragnarok, the problem with Marvel","Thor Ragnarok suffers from two very distinct, yet interconnected problems. First, as a lot of people have pointed out, Marvel has a fundamental flaw with their movies, they lack any feelings other than Snarky. Unfortunately, Thor: Ragnarok suffers from this problem for it effects both its overall narrative and performance for most scenes with feelings are just replaced with characters being snarky, rude, sassy, etc. From what I have seen with the past movies of 2017, both Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Spider-Man Homecoming, which both were funny and had capacity for emotions, Thor Ragnarok, with all of its tragic character backgrounds and story to try to embrace a more comedic atmosphere of Guardians in the Galaxy just because its ""IN SPACE"". This comedic atmosphere is completely destroyed by the inclusion of Hela and The Valkyrie and the lack there of tension between them, the plot of Evacuation with Heimdall, and the backstory with Odin and Hela. There is just too much tragic, hateful tension for a Comedy to thrive. Second, is that Marvel has the same problem as animation studios such as Kyoto Animations, but in live action movie form, creating most of their current movies by gluing together a large collection of Gifs. The Camera-work that was putting together the movie, with the cuts and edits, was awful, cutting away every half minute, ten seconds, 5 second, creating an extremely bumpy, limiting, and nonlinear presentation of a linear story. This movie had very little cohesion, with scenes that are cut with almost no information connecting them other than the fact that there are two key characters on screen.Because of these very noticeable problems, I am giving Thor: Ragnarok a 4/10. It progressed a story, with neither grace or intellect, but I'll give it something, it had Flare."
30 December 2017,jsdmnd,4,6,4,Dumb Movie,Thor Ragnarok is a typical dumb movie being churned by Marvel in succession. Marvel seems to think that people that follow comic books nowadays are under ten years old. Thor is not and I'll say it again for those who awarded this movie higher is not Guardian of The Galaxy. I was expecting for Rocket Racoon to pop anytime and what's with the Led Zep song blasting in strange numerous times/ I still quite enjoyed the movie just as long you switch your brain off completely. You can even have a little nap while watching and you wouldn't even feel like you've missed something when resuming to watch.
31 October 2017,koishnoish,7,16,7,"Good Fun, But Is That Enough? (SPOILERS)","Thor hasn't had a great track record in terms of films. I get the feeling the first film is met with a strange contention, some think it's a good time, others thin it's okay, I personally really like it, I like it's Shakespeare-esque qualities and I'm a sucked for inner family conflicts, the like of Thor and Loki. The second film, Thor: The Dark World, is generally seen as being pretty 'meh' and understandably, it's pretty lifeless and without any real interesting plot points at all, it's a totally missable movie. Now comes Thor: Ragnarok, a pretty serious storyline in the comics but played a bit more for comedic effect here.Ragnarok is a good time, of that I won't contest. You'll get a feel early on the film has been 'Guardian of the Galaxy-ised', that is to say it's approaching the film with a more comedic and tongue-and-cheek attitude rather than serious and Shakespearean vibe of the first film. The comedy, for the most part, works well in the film. It doesn't always land perfectly, and especially in the first act I felt it felt a little off, but once you really get into the swing of it it works well and lands well and the actors land their lines well.But I can't fully endorse Ragnarok, and it's annoying, because despite how the comedic tone works I'm not sure it really aids the movie or the story it's trying to tell. At the beginning of this film Odin meets his end, with Loki having been sat in Odin's place for far too long it is now Odin's time to pass, and he does, but now Hela, Odin's firstborn daughter, returns to take the throne and lead Asgard to war and domination, a conquest Thor must avert, but Thor is weaker than Hela and is thrown from Asgard so now he must pull together a team to thwart the new evil. It sounds fairly Shakespearean-esque, and if you watched only the scenes in Asgard with Hela you might think that's the way it's going to spin. Hela's scenes are dark and brooding, serious, whilst Thor on Sicar (I think I spelt it wrong?) are light hearted and carefree. It's a feel I think clashes harshly because there's some real stuff Thor has to deal with here.Firstly, Odin is dead, and secondly, Loki is essentially to blame for said death. I was expecting some kind of serious confrontation here. Everything that Hela is doing in this film is nothing Loki hasn't already done - Loki did try (did?) blow up an entire one of the nine realms in Thor 1. Thor also though Loki was dead whilst Loki instead just sat on Odin's throne and sat about. I think the film may have benefited if had worked more towards what Hela's character seems to push towards. Hela speak of the lies of Odin, of how Odin was no 'great and honest' king but also a tyrant. It would have been interesting to have a three way struggle between the siblings of Odin about the treatment they were given under their father, the sins of the father, if you would, that would make for some very interesting a deep conflict.It's problems like this that prevent me from really liking Thor: Ragnarok, in many cases the motivations and characterisation of characters makes no sense in context to their actual character. The Valkyrie decides to help Thor, for no reason I can discern, I completely get why she wouldn't help him. Loki seemingly decides to ally himself and stand by his brother by the end, despite the massive discussion they probably still have to have. It doesn't add up to me. In a medium that I love due to its story and character I think there's much wasted here, much that could have been developed into an insightful, more character fuelled film.On a side note, I am worried about Marvel's dramatic swerve towards humour as of late, I get that the company wants their films to be light hearted and fun, which is completely fine, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier pulled off a really good story whilst incorporating comedic elements and still told a good character driven story, I was hoping the same for Thor and I hope to see more stuff along those lines from Marvel soon."
3 April 2018,classicsoncall,2,14,10,"""The only thing that makes sense is that nothing makes sense.""","The reviewers for this film who like the movie cite the humor written into the script while the haters chastise the film for being too funny. I'm with the humor crowd, this was a fun filled super-hero flick that didn't take itself so seriously that it got in it's own way. I think the DC folks could learn something from 'Ragnarok', as their movies have been way too dark and foreboding of late.Interestingly, Thor wasn't my favorite character in the film. With somewhat brief appearances, I really enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, and Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster. I also got a big kick out of Korg, voiced by director Taika Waititi. Again, it all boils down to the comic element that was offered with understated confidence in the characters to pull off their roles. And as always, I have to hand my compliments to Stan Lee, creator of many of these Marvel Universe characters, in his portrayal of The Barber. Can you believe the guy is ninety five years old! That's staying power.The story itself doesn't offer many surprises since it's another one of those 'hero saves the world' confrontations against an implacable enemy. The world of Asgard, as stressed many times in the latter half of the movie is not a place so much, as the people who have a stake in it's survival. In the end, I was glad that Thor and his buddy Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) managed to find a ship that could withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity and could maneuver with an offline power-steering system that was able to function without an on-board computer. You don't know how many films are ruined when the good guys forget about those things.Before I forget, nice job by Cate Blanchett as the story's principal villain Hela, the Goddess of Death and first born of Odin (Anthony Perkins). That flashback scene of Hela destroying the Valkyrie had the kind of stunning imagery usually captured in the fantasy paintings of Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo. I actually had to pause the movie right there and proceed frame by frame until that sequence was over. For me, the scene compared artistically with the 'Time in a Bottle' sequence in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". That's the sort of stuff I love about super-hero movies."

5 November 2017,niehow,6,15,2,Same old stuff ruined by Led Zepplin,"I was hoping for something more than a recycled story of revenge with better blue- screen. If you were to change characters around it would be, ""Oh, I've seen this before"". That said the absolute horrific thing was the inclusion of Led Zeppelin's two most widely beloved songs used in the movie. Robert Plant is just so iconic and to infer that his music and this 12 year old ""superhero"" movie are on the same par was atrocious! At the second inclusion of Zeppelin I walked out of the theater. I know these actors make millions but don't they ever tire of doing the exact same plot over and over and over? How about a film without guns, magic, and mutants? I don't think Hollywood can make that anymore."
19 January 2022,viktorianazhmutdinova,2,5,7,The film will remain,"The film will remain in memory for a long time. This year he is the best as entertainment. The abundance of all kinds of colors, camera work (which is only worth shooting ""from the face"" of Mjolnir), a huge number of jokes, great special effects (at least give out an Oscar), old and new heroes (especially Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie) and even a couple of unexpected plot twists caused me an indescribable delight. Still, the movie isn't perfect. The musical accompaniment towards the end of the film was disturbing. The music was very upbeat and uplifting and didn't really fit in with what was going on. Why is the effect of immersion turned out to be incomplete. Loki is far from being as good (but still happy). Thor finally looks like a real Asgardian - brutal, powerful and impatient (all he needed was a haircut). What is important - the creators began to develop the franchise, for example, the Hulk became, more or less, reasonable and can speak. The best movie about Thor!"
3 November 2017,stevendbeard,2,12,8,Best of the Thor Movies,"I saw ""Thor:Ragnarok"", starring Chris Hemsworth-Ghostbusters_2016, Vacation_2015; Tom Hiddleston-Kong:Skull Island, I Saw the Light; Cate Blanchett-Cinderella_2015, the Lord of the Rings movies; Jeff Goldblum-The Independence Day movies, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Mark Ruffalo-The Now You See Me movies, Windtalkers. This is the third Thor solo movie-not counting the Avengers & Doctor Strange movies-and I think it's the best one of them all. In Norse mythology, Ragnarok means 'Twilight of the Gods', or basically, the end of everything. It really has some surprising instances where I found myself saying, 'They didn't really just do that, did they?' I won't spoil them all here but people die-and I'm talking main characters-and things are destroyed. Chris/Thor is neck deep in trouble when his older sister, Cate/Hela, shows up wanting to take over Asgard. FYI: Cate is the first female villain in the Marvel movie universe. Tom/Loki is thrown into the mix and you wonder just whose side he is on-remember, he is the god of lies. While fighting Cate, Chris gets sent to a planet run by Jeff/Grandmaster. Jeff has gladiatorial games as his source of entertainment and his current champion is Mark/Hulk. Guess who he gets to fight next? Stan Lee makes his usual cameo-look for the guy giving Chris a haircut-and there are a couple of other cameos, both of the super hero and actor variety. Let me tell you, Jimmy Kimmel would positively hate one of them. There is a lot more humor here, too. There is no Jane Foster & company. I want to mention a pet peeve of mine; Lots of times a song will be used in the trailer but not appear in the movie. I'm talking about Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song' here. That is not the case. It was used several times during Chris's fights. There are two scenes after the credits start. One just as they start and one at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence & action and some brief nudity- don't get too excited, it's of the Hulk's backside-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
27 April 2018,WooderIce64,1,2,8,"Different, but in a Good Way","The first two Thor movies are among the MCU's least popular. While they're still good movies, they don't compare to most of the MCU. Ragnarok, on the other hand, is among Marvel's best thus far. The word Ragnarok, meaning the end of all, refers to the destruction of Asgard and the death of the gods in Norse mythology. Pretty heavy stuff. Ironically, this is one of Marvel's most comedic movies. It's simultaneously one of the darkest in the franchise, and also possibly the funniest. It's a very difficult thing to pull off, but it's done here quite well. The movie also spends most of the time alternating between Sakaar and Asgard, which helps this effect. On Asgard, which has been invaded by Hela while Thor and Loki are on Sakaar, things are very dark and serious, and the film racks up quite the body count. Sakaar, on the other hand, is ruled by an over-the-top Jeff Goldblum who stages gladiator fights and has an array of over-the-top quirks. The contrast is clear. Another one of the movie's strengths was how awesome Hela is. Her backstory, where she conquered the 9 Realms with Odin until Odin sought to build a peaceful Asgard, was an interesting twist. Speaking of Odin, what's not awesome was how easily he died. While I'm not trying to compare this to Norse Mythology, there he was killed by Fenrir, the really big dog. Here, he just dies from some unexplained cause, looking out into the sea, with Thor and Loki by his side. It's peaceful, yes, but not nearly as awesome as what could have been. The Warriors Three, some of the most important characters in the first two, die early on and are never mentioned again. Sif isn't even in it at all. However, the characters that are given more attention are much better. Thor is not as serious as the other Avengers, but he is still clearly determined to save Asgard. Valkyrie is a fan favorite, and she has a good character arc of returning to Asgard after abandoning it years ago. By the way, am I the only one who thinks it's stupid that Thor, God of Thunder, is stopped by a little electric thing? Anyway, Loki continues his infamous side-switching, causing the viewer to question where exactly his loyalty lies throughout the film. The Hulk is in this movie, and the stakes with him seem much higher than they have in his previous appearances. Korg is Marvel's best comic relief, by far. There's a laugh every time he appears on screen. One thing that's noticeably lacking is that Jane Foster and friends aren't in it. And, honestly, good. The romance on Earth was easily the worst thing about the previous Thor movies. There are a few scenes on Earth, including a funny one with Doctor Strange. It is quite different from the other Thor movies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The post-credits scene, though... really got us ready for what's to come."
29 October 2017,gulfaran786,7,23,6,A Slapstick Comedy,"I will not deny that this movie made me laugh a lot but it also made me at many points think why? Was that really necessary. You could see when a serious tone was going to be broken and how as things lead up to it.Marvel deliver another weak villain who was cracking the weakest jokes. While dragging along a ""executioner"" who's presence to me didn't make any sense. No attempt at developing her character at all. Having seen the trailers I was expecting a Action movie with comedic moments but instead got a comedy with small moments of action.Tbf simply put everybody seemed to have lost their wits.Pretty disappointed."
18 September 2018,jackfull,2,4,8,A hilarious bit of Nostalgia infused Marvel,"This movie had a certain 80's, neon, electronic style to it that is very close to how Guardians of the Galaxy is. It is full of funny jokes, good packed action sequences, and well lets face it, most serious moments get ruined by jokes. there is one exception to this and that would be when Odin passes on. It is a very heartfelt moment with Thor and Loki, because as much as they tease and hate each other, they don't want to see their father go. Other than that one scene, the rest of this movie is a comedic explosion of color."

                        ",Good-vibe superhero entertainment,"Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop the ruthless God Hela.Director Taika Waititi offers more fun than the overlong, padded majority of Marvel films than it should, Thor Ragnarok has plenty of humour (maybe a little too much). From the special effects to costume design and colourful characters including actors Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor goes through a few changes certainly looks wise right up until the end. There's a welcomed on form return of Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston's sly Loki, Mark Ruffalo, who gets plenty to do with his dazed Banner and there's more Hulk action, with Anthony Hopkins' nonchalant Odin and Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who both cameo.New comers to the series evil Cate Blanchett, who is not just a 'end level baddie', Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and Karl Urban give more than the stereotype unsavoury characters, there's also a few twists and turns. Tessa Thompson is also noteworthy and excellent Clancy Brown voices Surtur. Waititi also voices the memorable Korg.There's the obligatory end credit scene, here two of them. Interestingly where as the Led Zeppelin ""Immigrant Song"" is overused Mark Mothersbaugh's music and the score is fitting to the 80s vibe throughout, sadly Magic Sword's epic tune ""In The Face of Evil"" appears to be omitted from the feature, only appearing in the trailer. Still Mothersbaugh's music has a similar feel.Overall, Ragnarok's strength lay in its entertainment value, thanks to some relaxed writing, likeable characters and story beats. Highly recommended."
13 January 2019,galactapotter,3,7,6,Message of cooperation alongside lots of explosions!,"This movie has a lot of character strengths; a lot of them have to fight internal battles and determine what it means to be good or evil. The MCU has plenty of engaging action scenes, and this is no exception. Thor massacres imps with his hammer, the Hulk beats up Thor, and Surtur smashes the Twilight Sword into Hela's skull. Asgard is slashed apart and torched. Also, just saying, Hela really is a beauty!"

6 March 2018,leonblackwood,1,5,8,Witty and full of action!,"Review:
What a great movie! I laughed from the beginning to the end, and the action was top form. I did find the humour slightly strange compared to the previous movies, especially the colourful cinematography used in Sakaar but it was very well written and the new characters, were all a great addition to the Thor franchise. Anyway, the movie kicks off with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) imprisoned on the other side of the universe by the fire demon, Surtur in Muspelheim. When Surtur reveals that Thor's father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is no longer at Asgard, and that it will soon be destroyed in the prophesied Ragnorak, Thor defeats Surtur, believing that he has prevented Ragnorak. Thor then returns to Asgard, to find his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in charge, so he gets him to tell him were there father is. With the help of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), they meet up with there father, who tells them that his passing will allow there sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), to escape from prison, were she was sealed a long time ago. Odin imprisoned Hela after she became too ambitious while she was the leader of Asgard's armies, forcing Thor to take the realm once Odin became too old to battle. Now with his son's beside him, Odin sadly dies and Hela appears, bringing pure evil with her. During a battle with her brothers, she destroys Thor's hammer, and sends them into outer space to die. Now in Sakaar, a slave trader, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) saves Thor from evil doers, and takes him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who forces Thor to fight for survival in the Contest of Champions. The first contestant that Thor has to fight, turns out to be the mighty Hulk, who is very famous in the land of Sakaar for beating all of the opponents that he comes face to face with. After a tight match, Thor finally manages to convince the Hulk that he is truly Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and with the help of Valkyrie and his brother Loki, they fight to get back to Asgard to save the people from the evil Hela. There are many other elements of the storyline that made this movie great, which is why I'm really looking forward to seeing another movie in this franchise. The thing that surprised me the most, was the fact that Thor was just as powerful without his hammer. I also enjoyed watching another side to Hulk, who really made me chuckle when he was in his luxury pad with Thor. Anyway, this is definitely one of my favourite films of last year, close to Wonderwoman, so it is truly a ""Must See"" from me. Great Film!Round-Up:
Although I really enjoyed this movie, it did seem a bit to comedic in some scenes, when it needed to be serious, which is due to the wacky director, Tamika Waititi, 42, who also played the role of Korg. With only 5 episodes of the Inbetweeners, What We Do In The Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople behind him, I'm surprised that the powerful Marvel bosses gave this young director a chance to direct this movie! In all cases, the gamble paid off, and I personally haven't heard a bad word about it. With the Black Panther smashing the box office at the moment, and Avengers: Infinity War coming out next month, Marvel can't do anything wrong, leaving the Justice League way behind. I was a bit skeptical when I saw that Disney bought the Marvel franchise but I'm actually enjoying what they have done with the comic book heroes.Budget: $180million

29 March 2019,Badmoviessuck,2,6,6,Dissapointment,"Second time doing this review god damn it.COMEDY
Comedy was alright it was the reason i gave it a 6/10 but it minimized the stakes of the movie which is not a big flaw i had cause even though they decreased the comedy so that the stakes were shown we still wouldn't care.
This movie would have been called one of the worst Thor movies if it wasn't funny to be honest.CHARACTER
We had a strong female character who was bad cause she had no development and just wanted to join the team because it was really convenient and they didn't have any better way to make her join and when she is with them they instantly become good comrads.
Hulk was alright but they could have done more to make him better like showing how it is to be Hulk and the struggles or some stuff like that.
I like how they depowered Thor but they could have used that as character development.
Thor struggles with not having the hammer and then Odin comes and Thor developes and the movie might be better.
Loki is the best character not good but the best at least cause of the previous movies.VILLAIN
Hela is a bad villain who had an alright motivation but was bland cause lack of screen time.CGI
Cgi was bad just watch Thor vs Hulk to see the worst part of the cgi.ACTION
Action was meh nothing special just a bunch of fast cuts to hide the fact that these people can't fight.
Jason bourne could do way better fast cuts like that cause those fast cuts were an artistic choice not a way to hide how the characters couldn't fight.VERDICT
Overrated movie.
What happened to the guy who ruled the garbage planet they just ignored him."
17 July 2019,FluffyPantsReviews,1,2,8,Thor Ragnarok: Lets Have Some Fun,Wow... Instead of the word fun I will just use Thor Ragnarok. What a turn around for the Thor franchise. Chris Hemsworth is great and I like the hulk but Mark Ruffalo acting as Bruce Banner is bad. Love Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and the sequences on Sakaar are so fun and the 3rd act on Asgard is so awesome and fun. Hela is not the best villain but gets the job done.
8 November 2017,mostafaeldakkak,8,19,3,What if Home Alone's Kevin Mccallister had Super Powers?!!,"He would have blown his house out of existing physics trying to stop the sticky bandits. I really wanted this to be another LOGAN level good Marvel movie but this movie is barely a even a parody. First of all, calling what is essentially an action COMEDY an apocalypse or ""RAGNAROCK"" is Ironic enough but here's what I walked out of the theater with. 1- Regular Machineguns work wonders at mowing down Asgardians. 2- The Cosmic Superpower planet known as Asgard apparently has a population of no more than 20 thousand. They literally walked a 2 lane wide bi-frost bridge and evacuated the planet using a single ship. Couple that with the fact that their best resurrected warriors were manhandled by a guy with 2 machine guns and I can see that conquering New York in ""The Avengers"" was REALLY AMBITIOUS. 3- I don't know who Thor is!!! a rugged warrior, a whimpering baby in the face of a haircut or alien goo, an Obnoxious brat, a self sacrificing hero, an intelligent and wise prince/king, a colossal idiot hopelessly performing black widow's lullaby for the Hulk? 4- Dead father, dead companions, destroyed planet, b#@ch of sister, crumbling throne. Screw it. Lets crack jokes for the audience. (That really did it for me). 5- Loosing an eye is a prerequisite to ruling Asgardians (the 349 ones left anyway). 6- We just blew up out planet to win (Wait what!!!!!). where to mate??? Well take us to earth. They love me there. We'll crash the entire planet's population in the new Avengers headquarters till we figure out what's what. This Movie has no sense of it's characters or it's events or its background or its purpose and it would literally sell you a dead family member's corpse for a joke, albeit a bad one."
17 April 2018,McFrogg,2,7,3,Thorformers Camp & Rock aka Batman & Robin just got better.,"Thor: Ragnarok makes me wonder how Batman & Robin would have been recieved if it came out today. Batman & Robin is actually far more serious than Thor: Ragnarok! There's real drama to be found in Batman & Robin. Alfred's illness, Mr Freeze's wife...Schumacher didn't ruin Batman's speech near the end by having him trip in his own cape/get electrocuted/knock himself out with a batarang. And as campy as Batman & Robin is, at least they didn't portray Batman as a stand up comedian. The endless jokes in Thor: Ragnarok makes it impossible to care about Asgard or Thor's friends who are killed by Hela. The threat in Batman & Robin felt more ""real"" than in Ragnarok. Almost every single scene is played for laughs. ""Devil's anus"", ""orgy ship"". It wouldn't surprise me if there's a deleted scene where Odin lets out a big fart before he dies. It's sad, because some of the jokes are actually pretty funny.The awful Led Zeppelin song they used in the trailers show up twice in the movie when Thor fights a bunch of computer animated creatures. Because every single comic book movie needs ""classic"" rock music these days. How lazy! One can criticize Batman & Robin for a lot of things (sexual innuendo, whiny Robin, rubber butts etc), but the score by Eliot Goldenthal is absolutely heroic.I don't mind jokes and funny situations in comic book movies. Stuff like that has been around since the beginning...but when everything is treated as a joke, the whole movie becomes pointless and depressing. If Thor: Ragnarok is considered one of the best superhero movies ever, perhaps people will regard Batman & Robin as a misunderstood masterpiece in the near future. What's the difference between seeing Batman's rubber buttocks, and Hulk's computer generated cheeks?"
16 November 2017,yangpoem,4,6,1,The name of the game is Ragnarok...kind of,"Thor: Ragnarok is a Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off. Plain and simple. It was a sci-fi comedy full of Guardians of the Galaxy's similarity both visually and in its humor. The film was packed with joke and the actions in the movies are weak. The movie is about something as dark and serious as Ragnarok yet the movie fails to show any seriousness to it and shows how little the subject is for the character to not have any sense of urgency towards it at all. Speaking of character, Thor was not Thor for the majority of the film. His personality has been push toward that of Tony Stark, where he makes jokes at nearly every single moment in the film. Regardless, Thor has some moments in the film that were funny along side that of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk and Tom Hiddleston's Loki. However, the hype the movie built surrounding that of the Valkyrie was just that, nothing but hype. During Thor's first meeting with the Valkyrie, Tessa Thompson was hyped to be a major or focal point in the film but during the climax unfortunately did nothing but show up here and there. In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok was a huge sci-fi clustered comedy movie with inconsistency in it's character strength all because the director rather have a movie full of jokes rather than a character driven, story driven and action packed film. A funny movie doesn't make it a great movie and that's what superhero critics fails to understand."
8 February 2018,Fluke_Skywalker,1,6,7,Ragnarocks,"Plot; Imprisoned on a far away planet and forced to fight in gladiatorial contests, Thor must escape his bonds if he's to return home and save Asgard from the wicked Hela. Of the solo Marvel film series, the Mighty Thor has probably fared the worst. A solid, if unspectacular, first entry was followed by a middling and utterly forgettable sequel. Ironically what the God of Thunder needed was a spark. Enter director Taika Waititi. Infusing the film with a quirky, offbeat sense of humor and a neon-soaked color palate, he finally allows Marvel's stuffiest Avenger to lighten up. For his part Hemsworth has always done well with the drier aspects of the character, but he clearly seems to enjoy getting a chance to loose up his armor a bit here. Just as in Planet Hulk (which inspired some aspects of this story), Hulk is much more articulate this go 'round. It allows the green guy to actually be a character and not just a mascot when he's not Bruce Banner. New character Valkyrie isn't just a token ""tough girl"", but a layered and fun counterpart for Thor. Where the film stumbles a bit is with its villain. Make no mistake, Cate Blanchett is great as Hela, but by whisking Thor half way across the galaxy for 3/4 of the film, she's given nothing to do but bide her time demonstrating her villainy in a series of ultimately meaningless cut-aways. She all but disappears for long stretches of the film, and at times I forgot she was even in it. But once Thor returns to Asgard everything clicks into place and it races to a satisfying enough finish that checks all the boxes.Thor Ragnarok isn't a great film, but it's a reasonably fun one, and perhaps just the sugary snack we needed before the heavy full course meal of Infinity War."
15 September 2018,kenneth-mooney,2,4,9,Best Thor movie so far,"I'm scrolling through these reviews and there are a disturbing amount of 1 star-ers. Grow up, getting snooty over a superhero movie is pathetic.
This Thor is the BEST on screen incarnation of Marvel's God of Thunder yet.
Yes, it's full of jokes. Chock full of em, actually. But they land. All of them. And they don't detract from the fact that this is leading up to what we now know are the devastating events of Infinity War.
Cate Blanchett brings simmering sexiness to Hela, Thor smoulders and Hulk rages, Loki camps it up as always and even Heimdall was tolerable in this one.
The previous Thor movies have been a chore to watch, especially Dark World. I welcome this light hearted take on the world of Asgard and hope we see another Thor of this caliber (assuming he doesn't get offed in Avengers 4 of course).
Great entertainment."
30 June 2019,JoeB131,1,7,8,A good action romp,"The third outing for the Thunder God, Chris Hemsworth and Tim Middleston put in fantastic performances as Thor and Loki, stranded on a gladiatorial planet.Lots of solid performances from the supporting cast, including cameos from Doctor Strange and the Hulk.So does it stand up? Reasonably well. Is it a particularly deep movie? Not really.Points for use of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song."
13 November 2017,DarkVulcan29,1,8,10,The Thor movie we have been wanting.,"Questions are answered like what happened to Odin(Anthony Hopkins) after Thor : The Dark World(2013), and were where Thor and The Hulk during Captain America : Civil War(2016).Thor(Chris Hemsworth) discovers he has a sister named Hela(Cate Blanchett) who is evil and has power beyond any control. And when Thor tries to fight her, Hela destroys his hammer, and Thor is transported to another planet, while Hela tries to rule Asgard. Will Thor stop her before it's too late? This is the best Thor all around, even knocks down the second Thor movie, got great humor and great action, Chris Hemsworth is always great has Thor, and has a cool fight with The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo brings some memorable moments here, so does Tom Hiddleston has Loki, and other cast members shine has well. It's everything you want in a marvel movie, and makes me excited for the next film."
11 November 2017,nogodnomasters,1,23,10,I make great mistakes all the time.,"OMG! Another Thor film, the most boring Marvel character to hit the screen. In the first scene, the writers saw fit to give Thor a personality and a sense of humor. The basic plot of the film is Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must save Asgard from his evil sister Hela (Cate Blanchett). However Thor is held captive by Jeff Goldblum in another world, fighting in a different kind of Thunder Doom. Stan Lee was his barber incognito.The film at times felt like ""Star Wars"" and the ending like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as they assumed the bridge pose. I really enjoyed the action, characters, and humor in this film. Clearly the best of the three, and it really doesn't require having seen any of the other films to enjoy this one."
3 January 2018,fabienbarabeart,5,9,2,One hot mess,"Thor Ragnarok was the worst of the three films so far. Why? The dialogue for instance, it took three writers for this? The movie goes in too many directions and at one point I was wondering, what are they trying to do? Is this supposed to be a science fiction, comedy or super-hero film? If I wanted to see a comedy then that's what I would have gone to see. I did not find what was supposed to be comedic moments funny at all, in fact, I cringed. It seems too many cooks spoiled the broth. 
Marvel had been doing so well and they had a good thing going with the first two films. This would have been better if they had kept with the Hela story line from the beginning and delve into the Odin myth a little more deeply. I can't fault the film for the special effects as there were some pretty impressive visuals. But it takes more than special effects to make a good film. Even the acting was lacking and that Chris Hemsworth simply did for the $$$$.
If Thor truly needed help in defeating Hela, it might have been better had he stayed with Dr. Strange rather then end up at the far end of the universe to find Hulk as his ally. He should have had help from the Guardians of the Galaxy while they were at it.
I suppose, I let myself get caught up in the hype with the initial reviews and how great it was doing at the box office as well as here on IMDb. I kept saying, I can't wait to see this movie and now I wish I had waited as this is two hours I can never get back. I'm only giving it 2/10 and that is being generous. Not worth the price of admission."
24 July 2019,FeastMode,1,16,8,Ragna-roks my world,"BEASTLY movie. Well-made and filled with great scenes. Easily one of the funniest movies in the MCU. On second viewing I would say it is the funniest. Easily one of my favorite musical scores of any MCU movie. Great villain. I love her and she's a beast. Wish I saw more of her and about her. One comedic moments was out of place and took you out of the moment, but the rest of the comedy works. Very fun and entertaining.They took this franchise in a new direction and I love it. This movie is visually exhilarating. I could probably take 200 screenshots of beautiful images. I loved everything about this movie. (5 viewings, 5/7/2020, 7/3/2022)SPOILERSI also wish I saw more of Hulk vs the giant wolf. But I absolutely loved all of the Hulk screen time in non-action situations. Finally got to see him as more of a character rather than just a smasher."
5 November 2017,sksaathi,3,7,7,Not expected this from Marvel.,"This is the worst from Marvel till now, run time is too short for movie like this. So many unwanted things, could've been so better. Screenplay wasn't great nor bad. If you are going for the comedy then it's at par but if you are going for super hero movie then you should think about it. At last, all we can hope for better movie in future..."

26 November 2019,magdikhanali,2,5,8,"As a non comic reader, I loved it","Well actually I am more marvel and DC movies universal, I never benn bothered by the originals or the comic storyline, so actually when to judge the movie can't see it from the haters (comic book fans) which I also can understand their anger, however let's see it from the displaying side, the picture was great, I don't know if Thor in the origins was funny or not but I liked this version and they extend the comedy side in avengers later on, the action was great but the ragnork event fight could be better but was OK, Hulk was great acting and the fun side in hulk personality, I know this might be worthless in eyes of some pple and I am telling why the high rates was given, the sound track of led zippllen was amazing and it was original touch, cgi was great and as usual Loki rocked every scene, the whole cast Tom or cate, Hobkins, tessa and Karl Ubran, the comedy genius Jeff goldblum, great appearance for Mr alba and Chris ofc, and Mark the hulk, I loved most of the movie and hela fight was evil one, only the last fight could be better, thanks for da movie, directing was fine and I loved the movie over all"
12 November 2017,ShelbyTMItchell,1,9,9,"Chris, Tom, Tessa, Cate in Form","A lot of comic book movies turned dark as that they lack on that of wit, charm, and soul. They sell out for the action. But this movie does not. As really it had more character development and bonding.Thor is imprisoned in order to do a Gladiator fight and still feels that Loki gets away with everything bad. As their father played by Sr Anthony Hopkins leaves this world and how that Thor and Loki are forced to do battle with the first born of their father's, a sister their only sister named Hela the film's main antagonistAs she is undefeatable as she ends up separating, Thor and Loki are separated as Thor is forced to do gladiator battle with Hulk a former friend that has been for two years going against his alter ego Bruce Banner. As Thor is captured by hard drinking no nonsense bounty hunter named Valkyre who has her own beef to pick with Hela. As she is working for the Jeff Goldblum character of the Grandmaster, who organizes the gladiator fights.Will Thor be able to defeat his own only sister turned bad, reconcile with Loki, and turned Valkyre to the good side in order to save his home and his people there?It has wit, charm, action, and character bonding and development. Come a long way since the original."
20 February 2022,MauryMickelwhite,1,2,6,"Love Waititi, but this one isn't for me","We've all been around that guy; the guy who drinks too much and then thinks everything he says is hilarious. To be fair, that guy is usually pretty entertaining, but when he drinks too much, his regular wit is lost and the only one laughing is him. So it is with Thor and every other character in this movie.In the Marvel movies, Thor has often provided comic relief but the comedy has been the fish-out-of-water or the gallows humor of battle variety. Here, Thor is in full Will Ferrell mode, yucking it up as his friends are murdered, his father dies, and his world is ended. I can't say that I didn't laugh, but the best I could muster was an occasional chuckle. The character is so far removed from his other appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that this movie doesn't seem to fit within that continuity.It's not a bad movie. It's colorful; it presents interesting worlds; if you're a comic book nerd, it creates a balanced hash of at least four classic story arcs. But while it seems to want to recreate what has worked for two Guardians of the Galaxy movies, it falls short. There are no jokes, just wise-cracks; the animated characters (which I think needs to include Jeff Goldblum) have too little life in them; and, worst of all, there is no heartfelt story driving the action. I liked the very brief angst of the Hulk's unrequited love for Black Widow (which was also the only good part of Avenger's Ultron) but that's about the only interesting moment. In the end nothing matters because nothing has been offered."
25 September 2019,lark40,1,6,9,The Fate of the Gods rests in the hands of bitter sibling who brings destruction and death and the end mystical fortress,"This is my 306 review
The opening sequence where Thor battles . Surtur for his horn bears a close resemblance to the Balrog the Fellowship of the ring In Lord of the rings fights in the mines,
and While Ragnarök traditionally means the end of everything, in the context of the film, it means disassembling what's already there, and rebuilding it. To me, it's stripping down the establishment, and then building it up in a new way, which is almost like this cyclic idea of Ragnarök. I love heroes that really go through ordeals and then come out the other end completely changed. That's way more exciting and interesting. You can never go back from that.""Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, with the grandmaster played by Jeff goldblum who has a gladiator ring and has battles this film grows on you and the battle with Thor and Hulk is mighty fun with no molijnar which is and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of his world, at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain hela had shape-shifting abilities(Cate Blanchett)In Valkyrie's
: ""It's in Loki's nature to change. He's a mercurial spirit, and the minute you try to define him he changes shape.
But tessa Thompson character is a feisty rebel on the rubbish planet her character valkrie loves to taser what' she wants But events in Ragnarök try and inspire him to change forever. The Goddess of Death shows up, and the stakes are high for everybody, so Loki, perhaps more than ever, is challenged to define himself in the face of that threat. He and Thor are in such an extraordinary situation where everything is so unfamiliar that their familiarity, as family members, becomes important."" we also get Doctor Strange leaving his calling card for Thor as loki disappeares into his magic realm
So I Thor getting everyone to safety on the bridge and with valkries Thor and the Hulk trying to fight his sister loki gets a chance to kinda save the day but its bitter sweet as he summons surtur the blitzkrieg asgard
The Director Taika Waititi does a fine job of reinventing the comic timing it grows on you this film sets a up the last few avengers nicely this film is not like the others you won't be sure about you have to watch again to appreciate it"
13 November 2017,lcollen,6,11,2,Humorous-Yes But Really Distracting,"I saw Thor: Fragglerock (oops) yesterday and all the humor that the reviewers seem to like so much was way over the top for me. I thought that Thor in the first two movies and in The Avengers had the perfect hint of irony. (So I guess when you cut your hair you get funnier!) But this time it was nothing like that with most of the characters, both old and new, delivering wise cracks. And as much as I like Mark Mothersbaugh's music this score was more than a bit disco laced and a really ill fit. Too boot the CGI was very obvious especially as you're not supposed to notice it at all. The saving grace(s) in this movie are Cate Blanchett who played her character well and Idris Elba who was reprising his role as Heimdall. Also without giving away the story future directors might have to follow this fairly disastrous story line now which will be frustrating for directors, actors and viewers alike to deal with."
30 November 2019,supermaggie,1,4,3,No Thor-movie anymore,"My goodness, where do I start? Perhaps with the most tragic thing: this is not a Thor movie. Period. Starting with the obvious: The producers take away Thor's trademark: the great blond mane - we all know what this did with Samson, and for this series it is almost the kiss of death. But unfortunately it was to be expected, because while Hollywood has been continuously discriminating against blonde actresses (and has made Cinderella African-American, Dorothy of Oz a Latina, etcetc.), it recently occupied almost more blond male actor than ever before, but it was only a matter of time that this comes to an end; instead of actually treating everybody equal (with equal advantages and equal disadvantages for all), whites are successively eliminated and disenfranchised - and this is not propaganda, just the observation of a propaganda taking place - and since they cannot replace the actor for the Nordic God ( naturally and authentically a blond actor) after several films and make him African-American / ... all of a sudden, they can at least cut his hair so short that it looks almost dark. (The fact that at least one blonde actress was cast with Cate Blanchett is good in itself, but more likely due to the New Zealand director than the discretion of Hollywood, and besides, she is allowed to participate only dyed black and portraying the ultimate evil; and in addition: the Valkyrie is hispanic - for real? That's an affront to all the Nordic nations, and if you did that with legends of nations of a different color, there would be rebellions, but you're obviously allowed to do that to white people, because nobody cares, and if they protest and try to defend themselves, they'll wrongfully and inappropriately be called Nazis). And then there is the problem that even with a crop it still remains a handsome blond actor, so he must be mutilated and lose an eye, I guess this is than okay/enough for the time being for today's political Hollywood. The fact that the quality and attraction of the films and the storytelling and the authenticity thereby completely perish does not matter anymore anyway. Only money and political propaganda still count. But that alone does not completely destroy Thor 3 yet. Three Australian and New Zealand actors in the main cast and a New Zealand director - and it turns into a surreal-poor Mad Max - Thunderdome-ish musical, only (fortunately) without singing. The whole series thus degenerates into a farce and great actors like Jeff Goldblum are degraded to a fool. You can actually spare another Thor movie. Dead and please do not revive, unless again as in the beginning, when the story (and legend) was still worth something."
15 July 2020,meissotruey,1,3,6,"Solid Entertainment, with wasted potential","This movie has so many good things, but not uses the potential, it could be so much better. Actually it could be 2 films serious and funny. One of the most impressive antagonists in MCU is wasted, story leaded by jokes confronts the atmosphere(or one of the atmospheres). And i also got da big question: why the hell Thor annihilates Surtur and then Surtur back and destroys Asgard, while fighting with Hela, who is thanosstrong, without being in Asgard."
25 October 2017,fablecastella,11,28,7,Cringed... but fun,"Beautiful cinematic scenes with colorful beats making this one of Marvels best movie yet. Its whimsical tone and easy to follow story pace makes it a film perfect for anyone who wants a light superhero movie.For me personally, i find this movie... cringed. Thor major 180 flip personality, Loki tone down power hungry manipulative personality, the some what short serious tone in between, the unnecessary Dr. Strange scene, the death of friends. Welp it seems that Jane dumping Thor makes his movie lighter and funnier. Overall its still one of the best movie to watch with family and or friends. The super light and fun characters is truly a blessing. It feels more like a stand-alone movie rather than a part of a series. Its just that fun! You don't need to watch the 1st and 2nd Thor movie, this movie will make you fall in love with Thor (more like Thor 2.0 Taika style)."
18 March 2018,Cujo_Firebird,3,8,2,When BLM and feminism meet,"Much like WW, the villain is defeated so easily.Ok family movie, but nothing to write home about.Personally what I really didn't like is how they changed one of the most beautiful warrior women from a blonde blue eyed bombshell into a scrawny black woman. in the same vein of Nick Fury.Would they be ok with a white Shaft?"
16 June 2018,mitsubishizero,1,8,10,Marvel's done it again!,"The best of the trilogy or at least one of the best (which's rare by the way) it's one of the best triquels ever made. As with every marvel movie there's an amazing balance between humor, drama and action. The characters are intriguing and really help progress the story. The new characters such as Korg and the Grandmaster are a welcome addition and are scene stealers in their own right. It's also cool to see all of the character development. Thor's much wiser especially when it comes to dealing with Loki who speaking of which begins to show his softer side.I can't tell you how awesome this movie was. It's best if you see for yourself."
22 December 2017,Robert_duder,0,5,7,Is there even a reason to review Marvel films anymore?,"Someone recently said Superhero films were the Millenium's version of the Western and that may be accurate. Westerns were around for a very, very long time and changed cinema history and there are some really good ones and some really terrible ones. No matter what you have to give insane kudos to Disney and Marvel for creating the largest cinematic Universe ever spanning Television and film and knocking it out of the park every...single....time. What was their mis-step out of 20+ films? The Incredible Hulk? Maybe. They've recouped that a hundred times over. I haven't always been super impressed with everything they've done and I do think certain aspects of the franchise is showing wear. The first Thor I actually thought was one of their least impressive films but the second one I thought was absolutely incredible. Thor Ragnorak falls somewhere in the middle for me. However, that's on sheer entertainment because as I read some things on this film I realized the sheer dept and fan service they pay to true comic fans. I was always a DC Comics kid so I miss a lot of the Easter eggs but Marvel fans must be over the moon. The film also is much more comedic than others in the Universe, above and beyond what would normally be there and honestly (especially in the beginning) it felt a little forced. The CGI is decent and the characters are a ton of fun. I honestly think Ragnarok was built for the die hard Thor and Hulk fans and they probably love it.Chris Hemsworth returns to the role as the God of Thunder. Hemsworth is one of the Marvel castings that was done with complete perfection. God help anyone ever having to play this role after him. In Ragnarok I found he wasn't quite as ""strong"" as he was in other films but then that also makes sense too given the storyline. He still commands the film perfectly and best of all his ego doesn't get in the way of the other characters. He shares the spotlight perfectly. Mark Ruffalo also appears as Bruce Banner and The Hulk. I personally think they made The Hulk look more like him. I'm not a Ruffalo fan and I never thought he was particularly well cast but he does well in this. He's basically always the same as Banner. He and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Tessa Thompson joins the team and apparently it's a huge deal for fans as she plays Valkyrie. She is a great character and perfect in her role. I loved the setup for her friendship with Hulk. I could see her carrying her own film. Tom Hiddleston also returns with perfection as Loki. He and Hemsworth have always had incredible chemistry and it's great seeing him back. He's one of the best anti-heroes/sometimes villains in movies. And you can't hav a great hero with a villian or in this case a villainess as Cate Blanchett takes that role. She is one of my least favorite actrors (I know...blasphemy) but she is good in this part. She is perfect given the story. Also to be honest, I knew she looked familiar but I couldn't place her at all until I read here. As with many Marvel films but especially Ragnarok the supporting cast is amazing. Jeff Goldblum, Idris Elba, Karl Urban (fantastic role), Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi (who is also the director and he gives an amazing voice role in a hilarious and fun turn as 'Korg' who was easily my favorite character in the movie.Taika Waititi is not a well known director and yet he handles this big budget Marvel spectacle expertly. I can't imagine what it must be like handling these characters and the special effects and the lore and the story and do so quite well. The space travel alone is incredible and the battle scenes as well and the amount of choreography and people involved. So really my review is this ... for me who is not a huge Marvel fan but respect the heck out of this massive Universe and the popcorn type fun it provides, it was okay on the scale of what they've offered. But for those of you who adore Marvel and have been fans all your lives, I think you'll be blown away by this and the Easter eggs are plentiful. This definitely shows that the universe is not in danger of slowing down anytime soon. 7/10"
31 May 2019,bgar-80932,1,7,8,Just fun,A lot of Marvel movies try to be funny and serious and to me it takes away from the thing a bit. They're all at least a decent watch but if the end of the world is threatened you shouldn't be making stupid little one liners all the time. This movie took the fun role the whole way like Guardians of the Galaxy did in my opinion. Yes there's a big threat and everything but the whole way it's just fun. Thor fighting Hulk. A crazy escape from a colorful bizarre world. It just never took itself all that seriously and to me that's good. It needs to be all in or all out so I rank this as one of the best Marvel movies out there right up there with Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers. I'm only up to this one though so I still have like half of them left to watch. My main gripe on this was it was a little long for a fun flick like that. Should have been like an hour and a half although I don't know what needed to be cut.

Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. New Zealand director Taika Waititi directs this super colorful, funny superhero movie presented by Walt Disney Pictures. He also voices the lovable character Korg.It's fresh and fun family entertainment that makes us love Thor even more.Uplifting theme: Brother's keeper Forgiveness People are more important than places. Teamwork, unity Love, service to others ""A wise king must never seek out war, but must always be ready for it."" – Thor ""I choose to run towards my problems and not away, because that's what heroes do."" - ThorThings I liked: Chris Hemsworth is awesome, but everyone else in the cast also steals the show. It's a collection of fantastic actors who each contribute unique, entertaining characters to the story. Tom Hiddleston is a better Loki we're learning to love. I have adored the talented, beautiful Cate Blanchett for many years. How is it that she never ages, but I do? She makes a fantastic villain. Anthony Hopkins is always epic. Awwww, Benedict Cumberbatch. Doctor Strange has an amusing visit with Thor. Mark Ruffalo spends more time being The Incredible Hulk, but Hulk is really endearing in this film. Jeff Goldblum is hilarious. I love him in everything he does. Fun surprise cameo towards the very beginning of the movie. No spoilers! It appears that Marvel has finally learned that audiences love fun, funny, irreverent, out-of-the box thinking superhero movies. Ever since the first Guardians of the Galaxy (Plus Bonus Features)thrilled audiences, superhero movies have lightened up a lot more, don't you think? Female fans get to see Chris Hemsworth with his shirt off. Wow, those arms are the size of tree trunks! For those who love his long, golden locks, you're in for a surprise. I love that Marvel puts Stan Lee in every movie. I always look forward to seeing what funny line they give him. Stay until the end of the first set of credits to see more. Then, stay until the very, very end of all the credits to see another funny scene with the Grandmaster. In an interview, Taika Waititi said that 80% of the movie was improvised. What? That's crazy and amazing! Led Zepplin's Immigrant Song really rocks the final battle scene. The Gladiator scene with Thor and Hulk in the arena was extremely entertaining. Some new creatures and characters fill the Marvel Universe with even more creativity and fantasy. Energizing soundtrack: Thor: Ragnarok Things I didn't like: · Some fake video-game looking fight scenes. Some of the jokes don't quite get the reaction I'm sure the director hoped they would.

23 January 2018,johnny-burgundy,1,3,8,Bromantic Action Comedy,"Thor: Ragnarok (2017)
This is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor. Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela and the impending Ragnarök. It is the sequel to 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World. It is the seventeenth film in the MCU. It stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Hopkins. The film received mostly positive reviews, with many critics declaring it the best film of the Thor trilogy. The comedy and music are exceptional for an MCU film. The action scenes appear less frequent than most, but the scenes themselves are high quality. The highlight for me is the budding bromance between Thor and Hulk. It's pure genius, and could clearly be a solid running theme in the MCU."
18 March 2018,sketchersson,4,6,1,No. Just no.,"This movie was pure trash! You could tell just by watching the beginning, okay I get it a little comedy is okay every now and then but there was too much comedy. 'The devils anus' that's inappropriate and immature. Thor losing his eye, okay a battle is a battle and people lose parts of the body, but to show the blood wasn't necessary. Marvel really let themselves go with this one."
5 November 2017,tbhardin-93226,9,18,5,missed the mark,"Action movie. yes! Entertaining? sort of. Too much humor? I think so. Does it follow Norse mythology? Not even close. I own the other Thor movies, but I won't buy this one until it hits the 3 dollar bin at Wal mart.Since this won't take my formatting. Thor Ragnarok is a busy movie that could be 45 minutes shorter and be a lot more entertaining!"
3 November 2017,cruise01,0,9,10,Pure fun with laughs and excitement with its action spectacle.,"Thor is a smashing fun time that is funny, action packed, and visually colorful with its direction. Not sure if director Taika Waititi took notes about moving away from its serious direction with Thor The Dark World movie and turning to Guardians of the Galaxy style. Cause Thor: Ragnarok did not take itself too seriously. There was humor in almost like every scene, the style and the music score playing like an 1980's science fiction techno movie was what made this movie pure fun. It made the movie to be the best out of the three. The plot follows Thor (Chris Hemsworth) facing against Surtur (a demonic looking beast), and on his return home to Asgard. He notices his father is missing and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is once again trying to rule their kingdom. On the search for their father, they come across Hela (Cate Blanchett) the god of death. Who plans on taking over Asgard. While Thor and Loki get lost in a foreign planetz Sakaar. Where Thor gets captured by a Valkrie (Tessa Thompson) who sells him to the grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). The grandmasters plan to have Thor face against his long winning contender in a gladiatorial battle. Thor: Ragnarok is a lot of fun from beginning to end. There is not one dull boring moment. Yes, it may slow down in the middle of the second act for the characters to have a dramatic moment. With Thor and Hulk trying to convey the other about leaving and staying. Then, there is Hela who is hellbent on taking over Asgard's throne for a very personal reason (Without giving away spoilers). And Valkrie personal vendetta after losing her team in a war which has been affecting her and causing her to drink a lot so she can forget. Every character seemed to have a fun moment. Thor throws out a lot more cheesy one-liners. Hulk has some fun moments with his lines. And even Loki has some fun betraying and somehow always having a heroic moment that makes you forget what he did before. Jeff Goldblum was the highlight of the movie as the grandmaster. Playing an evil narcissistic character. There are a lot of action sequences that is entertaining and big. The fight scene with Thor and Hulk was funny and awesome. The visual effects are astonishing. The direction is colorful. The set designs are fun to see. What I also mean that the film does not take itself seriously. There was a hilarious moment when Thor is strapped to a chair that's going through a little tour of Sakaar and the music choice may seem familiar to another classic movie. Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is pure awesome. I never had this much fun since Guardians of the Galaxy. The direction in this film is way different than the other two movies. Its colorful, the music score is great. (There is two scenes were the ""immigrant song"" played in the teaser trailer was used.) And it worked great in those action sequences. The cast ensemble all had fun and had their moment to shine and had some humor. The action sequences were great and the visual was amazing. Also, there are two post credit scenes. The mid credit you can say is somewhat important for a future film. And the end credit scene was just meant for laughs and gags. Nothing serious.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. Definitely worth checking out on the big screen for its exciting action and colorful fun direction."
16 November 2017,speedcanary,2,6,6,A Different Thor,"I had a difficult time even rating this film. I have a special affinity for Thor in general, especially because the first Thor film is the movie that brought me into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I really love that film. I had to check my star rating and I rated it an 8. The follow-up to that film, Thor: The Dark World was good, but not as good as the first one and I rated it 7 stars. So because this one, while a decent adventure film, is my least favorite of the 3 Thor movies, I had to rate it 6 stars.Tonally, I feel comedy was overused and there were many instances where you could tell they were trying too hard to be silly, and it fell flat. While being sold as a buddy comedy of sorts, I don't think it even meets my expectations for a buddy comedy. I giggled maybe a few times, but there were no laugh out loud moments.The talent in the film was underutilized. Cate Blanchett certainly came off as serious and dramatic, but against the flippant comedy of the characters, her performance was made comical. The tone of the film did not work for me at all. Compare it to the first Thor, that was excellently acted and dramatic, yet had funny moments. It was a more serious work definitely. Even Thor: The Dark World had excellent writing and serious acting and tone, and injections of humor. The first two Thor movies had a great balance of humor and drama. This one lacked drama and tension. The conflict, while present, was not one of tension and suspense because of the petty behavior of the characters.The film was fun to watch though. The soundtrack was pretty good. I wish the tone of the film could have lived up to the rocker edge the music gave the movie and Hela. My initial thoughts while viewing Thor: Ragnarok were it felt like I was in an early 90's video game and that it was campy like watching a mid-80's coming of age film about misfit boys."
21 April 2018,gjek-06360,3,5,10,The best movie of Marvel I've ever seen,"First, the story line was really complete and perfect. My favorite part was when Odin said, "" Ascar was not a place, it was people."" That meant Thor saved Ascar eventually, even though the place was destroyed. 
Second, the characters of the leading roles and supporting roles were really impressed, For example, Skurge surrendered to Hela at first for saving his life, but his mind told him to fight for Ascar. As a result, he fought for those people, not just for atonement, but for his honor. 
Third, the soundtrack was arranged so well, so that I enjoyed in this movie a lot. Take an example. The final war at Ascar, the song was so exciting for audiences. 
Last, this movie was not just an action movie. There were lots funny parts that could make me laugh. And I thought those really spiced up this movie. 
In conclusion, This movie was really a master-piece, and it totally worth 10 stars."

Loki said he'd been there for two weeks and is friends with the Grandmaster.
Why does he look shell shocked and act as if he had no idea The Hulk was The Champion?"
2 November 2017,afatedcircle,2,6,7,Can we get a non-mediocre SERIOUS Thor?,"Went into this movie thinking it would be better than the first two, it wasn't. I'm glad I spent $6.95 for the 2D instead of going for the more expensive 3D as this movie was just good enough to warrant that $6.95. You've seen the trailers? Cool, you've seen the action and fights in the movie. You want comedy? Hey you'll get some of that but it'll quickly not be as funny when you realize that's all they're going for and you're constantly barraged with one liners. Oh and for the love of Odin what was the point of Thor losing an eye?"
19 November 2017,DeBBss,1,7,10,"One Word, Masterpiece...","Thor: Ragnarok is by far the best Thor movie released, Thor: Ragnarok has everything Marvel is known for, the great comedy, the characters and the creative story. Thor: Ragnarok is exactly what I expected it to be. There was also a lot of comedy, but luckily it worked.Story: 10/10The whole story is about Thor's sister wanting to take over Asgard. Thor does have a sister that was never introduced to the MCU. While Hela (Thor's sister) is trying to take over Asgurd, Thor is trying to get home to try and prevent her. Thor meets Hulk after 2 years in a battle arena, and Thor is trying to get his help. While on Thor's way he meets people that will help him in the long run. The writers did a great job introducing these knew characters and the destruction of Asgard. There are no problems in the story that effect it, so overall the writers did a good job.Characters: 10/10Thor: Now the new Thor has been introduced. Thor doesn't need his hammer know (because it broke) and he has an eye patch. I like the idea of Thor using his fists and not his hammer, but I don't like how they added the eye patch. But the changes to Thor make him more awesome.Loki: Loki will never change, and I never want him to change. Loki has this foolish attitude that just makes him even more likable. Loki has this charisma that makes him so entertaining to watch. Hela: Hela is a very mysterious character. We only get to see her past in a few scenes that set up her reasons to take over Asgard. I like the character and her helmet, but they don't set up her past very much, so I can't really feel sympathetic towards her, but I don't know if they wanted me to feel bad for her.Korg: Korg isn't really important to the plot, but I added him in because of how funny he is. Taika Waititi did amazing on Korg. Korg's voice and the way he talks is so funny. Korg alone is probably sixty percent of the comedy.Action: 10/10The action and CGI is done well, Thor: Ragnarok relies heavily on CGI. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well. With such entertaining action the time went by quickly. The best action scenes in Thor: Ragnarok is when Thor and Hulk are fighting and the last fight on the bridge. Overall the action is what you would get from a Marvel movie.Thor: Ragnarok has a perfect blend of storytelling and comedy. There might be a little too much comedy, but it works, there was no moment when a joke didn't work. Overall Thor: Ragnarok is a perfect 10 out of 10 for me."
4 August 2018,toshinori-32770,2,3,1,WORST MARVEL MOVIE,"It should be a serious movie because its about ragnarok..but nooo the director making the movie hillarious cringe and not funny at all. the hulk become a puppy, banner looks stupid, and thor losing his charisma in this movie, good job director!!
and dont start with that stupid ugly cgi character. so dumb!"
10 October 2019,leonjarmstrong,9,20,1,Borderline offensive to the source material.,"If you enjoy this film then fair enough,more power to you. But if you care about comic book movies being respectful to the source material, this film should really bother you. Ragnarok is a fantasy EPIC and incredible battle with extremely high stakes, that's just the comic book and mythology. This film however, is very different! It is a parody, one big joke. It should literally be called Carry On Asgard. Taika Waititi should honestly be ashamed he made so much money of this hot garbage ""comedy""."
18 July 2018,rumme_sweety0404,4,8,5,Where's the actual ragnarok?,"Can't agree with all the love and the praise this movie received. As with all Marvel movies I have high expectations, and on graphics they really do deliver. But the storyline and script of this movie does not go into my taste. Ragnarok? Where the heck was the actual ragnarok? You can't just call a movie ragnarok and have it be only a '10-mins-in-the-end' experience! And maybe the idea of integrating more humor is nice.. but at most times it was just too corny, and of low quality. Fight scenes cut weirdly so you see the attack begin, but not really end.. Hela is so powerful in Asgard, yet Thor still got to her. Loki deceived again and again, and then all of a sudden with no real reason he helped.. Too many things were a bit too easy for my tastes and for my expectations of a Marvel movie"
18 July 2018,Enchorde,0,2,7,"A little more comedy, a little less story","Thor is back again. This time he got to save Asgard (again), and to do it he got to find himself and his true power (again). Well, he got to save Asgard from his sister Hela, Odin's first born child, who come to claim Asgard. And Hela is the goddess of death, so she is powerful, and will grow ever more powerful if she get to Asgard (which she of course does).Once again we get a visual extravaganza, although there are not so many scenes from within Asgard ( I like Asgard and it's visual themes ). Once again we get some thrilling action, combat and fast paced chases. That is much what the Thor movies is about. But this time there is much more emphasis on comedy, slap-stick and delivering one-liners. Sometimes so much that it seems like the point of the scenes, the point of the script, is not the action but the one-liners. Unfortunately it detracts a little from the story and thus the movie.What I do like though is how they handle the characters (apart from Thor that is forced to think to fight more with flair and style), and especially so Loki. For once Loki get to be the trickster he truly is, not only to conspire and plot for personal gain. This time he balances on the sharp edge of good and evil, crossing the line so many times you never know which side he is on. I really hope this is a trait that Loki will be allowed to develop in coming movies.Thor Ragnarok is a really good movie (but I have to point out that you should see the other Thor / Avenger movies to get all the references). But it is a step away from the two earlier Thor movies, which had it's funny parts but had the focus on action and story. I think the earlier one's fit Thor better.7 hammers out of 10"
20 July 2018,john_titmus,2,4,3,Such a waste,All those ingredients to make a brilliant Thor movie but it comes off silly and immature with its kiwi director and his childish humour shining through as with his other projects. Is easy to appear full of talent from a country that has so little. The plain silly humour from what we do in the shadows is repeated here. Jeff Goblum butchered his character and Cate Blanchett normally brilliant fails the Hela role as does Karl Urban. Worse Marvel film since the first attempt at Hulk with ang lee. Such a waste. Bests scenes of the film are the hulk talking he steals the show.
3 November 2017,chakor-74657,2,5,1,Surreal,"The Good: Visually I loved pretty much everything about it (minus some of the Sakaar scenes). The film certainly has its moments, and I loved the overall storyline when it was properly used (which isn't very often, I'll talk about this more in ""The Bad"" section). All of the cast are very solid in their roles even if they are a bit annoying at times (Grandmaster I found particularly annoying). Most of the action sequences are well done and easily some of the best parts of the film. My favorite scenes of the entire film are the scenes when Hela kills the Asgardian soldiers, Hela explains her backstory, and the scene where she resurrects the dead soldiers and Fenris with the Eternal Flame.She was actually my favorite part of the film. She has plenty of good action sequences, is tons of fun to see on screen, has a passable amount of screen time, and has some decent dialogue when it isn't hindered by the comic relief. However, the only things that really make her a step above most of Marvel's past bland villain offerings are the performance, visuals, and of course the fun factor. Hela is essentially to this film what Tim Curry's Pennywise was to the 90's IT miniseries. Loki is easily my second favorite part of the film as he is still a great character and we've gone for far too long without seeing him on the big screen.The Bad: This is one of those movies where they show you a lot of good story elements but never fully utilize them - ever. To me it almost feels like an attempt by the studio to troll the audience by saying ""Hey, we know we can do this, but we won't anyway and instead we'll substitute it for comic relief or pretend it didn't happen"". I can't tell if the writing was originally this lazy or if it just turned out that way because of the humor. I didn't feel that any of the characters had their backstories explored to their full potential. Grandmaster was by far the most underused as we only get these vague hints as to his origin. Hela's backstory is ironically the most fully-explained albeit still not fully utilized. Skurge was a joke.And of course, now we get to that part. Albeit overused in the MCU's past, humor has never been something that fully hindered by ability to enjoy any of their movies. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. The opening scene with Thor and Surtur pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film from start to finish. The final battle is by far the weakest part of the film, both due to the nonstop one-liners and the fact that very little emphasis is actually put on the coming of Ragnarok until near the end of the battle. I wanted there to be some humor in this, but not American Werewolf in London-level humor where I just can't stomach stake and ice cream on the same plate.Conclusion: Overall it was an enjoyable watch and I'm certainly glad I went to see it. However, despite its moments, I can't help but feel that the film was a massive waste of potential on so many levels. They show you so many glimpses of really good stuff, but whenever you think they'll use it, they don't. Thor (2011) is by far the superior film in my book, although this is still far better than The Dark World where the entertainment factor is concerned.On my first viewing I'd give it a solid 6/10. I may very well be coming off more negative than I really mean to sound and I might be a bit too harsh. I desperately wanted to like this more when walking out of the theatre, but I simply cannot bring myself to. If the rumor is true that they made this a full-blown comedy to make the ""impact"" of Infinity War greater, then it is truly a shame that they had to sacrifice the quality of what could have been one of the best MCU installments in exchange for something else. Who knows, I may change my mind on a second viewing. Post credits scenes are nothing worth staying for this time around."
23 January 2019,SofiCastle,1,3,9,It took three films but they finally made it,"Thor 1 was mediocre (and oh my God, so badly acted by Chris Hemsworth), Thor 2 was impossible to tell what they were aiming at (at least Hemsworth improved), but Thor Ragnarok is, finally, a very good superhero film. Funny, well acted by the whole cast, interesting to watch despite of a long running time, great supporting characters. And, for the first time, Thor (and not Loki) is the protagonist. Honestly, the first two installments could have easily been titled ""Loki"" and ""Loki: the dark world"". Thor: Ragnarok is the first film that earned its title (and sadly pushed Loki out of the scene for good)."
12 October 2020,alicealice-67133,4,13,1,Just a money maker...,"Marvel doesn´t care about anything else than money.
I admit that this movie made me laugh but i also left cinema extremely disappointed and never wanting to watch Marvel again.
I loved previous Thor movies even though they weren´t perfect. Thor and Loki´s relationship was very intriguing and the world building of Asgard was beautiful.
I wanted to see more of that fictional world, i wanted to see Loki deal with his identity, relationship with Thor and his mother´s death. There was so much potential for Thor: Ragnarok. It could´ve been a serious, heartbreaking and emotional movie that people would remember for years to come.
Instead we get this comedy with no character development. Loki is suddenly friends with Thor again. No mention of him being Frost Giant or anything that happened in past. They have no talk about it.
The whole thing is just a joke after a joke and everyine are out of character because of that.
Because of all that, it´s my least favorite Marvel movie ever."
8 November 2017,jonas_bassforce,4,14,5,Every single character can't be comic relief!,"Are we watching a comedy or an action adventure? A friend of mine hyped this to the skies before I went to see it. He said it was epic, great, and didn't take itself too seriously. But that was probably the big problem. From that description I was expecting something like Guardians Of The Galaxy 1, or likewise. But unlike Guardians this one relied so heavily upon humor that about halfway thru the story was totally lacking in gravity. All Marvel movies have a lot of comedy yes, but mostly that's been handled with care. This one didn't take itself too seriously, I give you that, but in the process of ""not taking itself too seriously"" it made itself feel dishonest at times. You can't make a movie where every single character or event is a comic relief! The audience gets confused about what should be funny and what shouldn't, and before you know it's not funny anymore but boring.Really, you have a story line about a family that is actually kind of tragic:Your father dies and you find out about your psychotic murderous sister whose very existence he's never told you about. In your last attempt to stop her, your home gets destroyed. All you're left with is your treacherous adopted step-brother who already has tried to kill all your friends on countless occasions. Talk about family drama! But where is all the emotion that should come with it? The only hint of emotion we get is delivered by Anthony Hopkins, and not because it's a great scene but because he's a great actor. He actually out-acted every single actor in the whole movie in just a couple of seconds. And where is the real threat? Cate Blanchett is a great actress too but her character never felt threatening or gave the plot any gravity. Just some funny looking person in weird clothes like all the rest. Since the movie relies so much on humor it seems like the characters don't even care. If they don't care, why should the audience? Guardians, while relying a great deal on humor itself, at least made you care about the characters.One thing I actually liked was The Hulk. But not as the ""Hulk"" but as Bruce Banner. He was fun to watch. But as the rest of the movie he was also lacking in depth as soon as he found out where he was. On a different planet for two years, and he didn't even know about it? That should have driven any man out of his mind, yet even he managed to joke it off like it was nothing. I guess you shouldn't expect much out of a movie based on comic books, but since Civil War my expectations has gone up considerably. Or this type of humor might just not be my cup of tea."
29 October 2017,oguzhan-192-780370,6,20,6,Another classic superhero movie,"If you want to see something original, you will be disappointed. This is just another superhero movie that just make you smile in few scenes.I used to be a big fan of superhero movies until I realize Marvel and DC are filming the same stories over and over again. After one point, it gets boring. There is always one super villain in the movie. At one point of the film, this super villain beats our lovely superhero. But somehow, superhero always finds a way to beat the villain at the end. In this paragraph I will sump up all the Thor movies. Thor always gets beat up in the beginning, then finds a way to beat the villain of the movie. At one point, Thor needs help from Loki. Loki can't do anything but help because the situation is so hopeless. But near the end, Loki always betrays Thor.If you want to see the same story, it is fine. You can enjoy it. Just, don't expect something new."
12 November 2017,fredschaefer-406-623204,1,8,8,"Best comedy of the year, and the best Hulk movie yet.","THOR RAGNOROK may not turn out to be everyone's favorite Marvel super hero movie, but it will certainly be the funniest. Disney and Marvel wisely understood that we have become familiar enough with Thor, Loki, and the other denizens of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that it is time to have some fun with them, along with the tropes and conventions typically found in their super hero action movies. There is plenty of witty, knowing dialog (starting with the captured Thor's conversation with the demon Surtur), along with some great physical humor (such as when Bruce Banner does the pratfall of all time on the bridge at Asgard) that never descends to the level of parody, camp or snark. At the same time, it is still a film very much part of the Marvel movie canon, as the story brings some major changes to world of Thor and Loki, not to mention Asgard itself. And though Thor is in the title, this just might be the best Hulk movie yet, as we find out just what the Big Green Guy was up to during the events of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, which was basically another Avengers movie.The plot basically hinges on Thor and Loki's older sister, Hela, the Goddess of Death itself, who comes to claim the throne of Asgard, and then prepares to conquer Midgard (Earth), the tenth realm that Odin spared. Hela is powerful enough to shatter Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, with her bare hand. The defeated Thunder God and Loki are banished across the universe to the planet Sakaar, where Thor is enthralled to the tyrannical Grandmaster, and forced to fight in an arena with the Grandmaster's champion – enter the Hulk. Soon, Thor has put together a ragtag band of misfit heroes and is heading back to Asgard to confront Hela. We know where this story is going, but the fun is in the journey, as Thor has to contend with Loki's treacherous nature, a recalcitrant Hulk, and then an addle-minded Banner. The high point of the film has to be Thor and the Hulk's battle royale in the arena, maybe the best throw down yet in the super hero genre between two awesomely powered heroes. It's one of the reasons why I think this is the cinematic Hulk's best hour yet.Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Mark Ruffalo are in fine form as the main heroes, with perfect comic timing. They are joined by Tessa Thompson as Valyrie, the requisite bad ass female, and the walking rock pile, Korg, a good use of CGI. Marvel has a history of under developed villains, and Hela is another in their long line of would be tyrants who are just bad and mean because they are just bad and mean, but Cate Blanchett, channeling some of that LOTR intensity, makes her a worthy Big Bad. Jeff Goldblum does his best Jeff Goldblum thing as The Grandmaster; Karl Urban makes a great Skurge, and along with Stan Lee's appearance, there are amusing cameos by Luke Hemsworth, Sam Neil and Matt Damon. Benedict Cumberbatch shows up to briefly to lend a hand as Dr. Strange, and Anthony Hopkins is back yet again as Odin. Nobody could voice Surtur batter than Clancy Brown. But the real star of the show is director Taika Waitiki, an independent film maker from New Zealand, who has made what might be the best comedy of the year; he also does the voice of Korg.I loved the shout out to one of the most memorable scenes in WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, a fine example of the film's sly humor; and how many times have we seen a rest home called Shady Acres in movies. But what most impressed me was THOR: RAGNOROK's homage to the comic artwork of the great Jack Kirby, especially in the detail filled wide shots of the planet Sakaar; Kirby was truly the Cecil B. DeMille of the comic book, this movie does justice to his vision.Let's hope that Justice League movie is half as goodor a quarter as funny."

4 November 2017,kuarinofu,0,5,8,Visually beautiful 2 hrs of actors having fun on set,"First of all, props to all the visual effects teams involved, IL&M and others, the movie really did look amazing (even though 3D felt off sometimes).This movie is very similar to another MCU movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" in many ways:1. This movie also had almost no plot, and even those parts were standing still for about 80% of the movie. By the end of the movie the plot is rushed through a couple of scenes and ""bam!"", it's over.2. It also has the same structure: most of the movie consists of action scenes and funny exchanges between the characters. Sometimes the movie goes deeper and opens some of the backstories but it always feels forced. I remember even a couple of lines like ""so, what's your story"" and the guy starts to backtrack.3. Like in GotG2 I found it really hard to care about any of the characters and the ""story"" just because nobody in this film cares about what's going on. Nobody has motivation to do anything. They just sort of do things because they sort of should and thus everything is funny and just a daily routine for them. Thor's father is dead and his home is invaded but he still has some time to spend pushing funny lines with his friends. Banner spent 2 years being Hulk and still behaves kind of confused and corky, trying to be funny as everyone else. Loki's presence was completely optional but they obviously couldn't just remove him from the story.4. Most of the characters are interchangeable. They occasionally get some sort of personality traits but most of the time they all act and react the same.My biggest problem with MCU movies is that as there's more and more movies being released they tend to lose any sort of originality and freshness (which is typical for anything not just movies). It would've been much easier for me to remember each movie if I had something to grab to, like a strong character or a really intense emotion, but these movies just fail to deliver those lately.It is interesting that DCU movies are often blamed for being too serious and dark to be actually fun, but MCU ones are drifting further and further away from being called actual movies becoming pretty much what they should be, I guess - a motion picture representation of a comic book.I'm not a comic book fan but I still hope that comic books are not all about flashy imagery and easy laughs. Or am I wrong?8 for the looks and some well done action."
5 November 2017,swilliky,0,5,8,A brilliant Marvel film,"The latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a brightly colored ride of hilarity and gorgeous special effects from brilliant director Taika Waititi. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) begins the film trapped in a cage after following a bad dream about Ragnarok, the end of Asgard. Thor has been captured by the demon Surtur (Clancy Brown) but he breaks free and uses his hammer to fight off Surtur's demon's soldiers and knock off the demon's crown. He tries to get called back to Asgard but it takes a minute since Skurge (Karl Urban) is now in charge of the Bifrost. Thor does returns along with a severed dragon head and finds that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in charge maintaining his disguise as Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Thor and Loki head to Earth where Loki stashed him but the nursing home is torn down. With the help of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Thor finds Odin in his last moments. He warns of Ragnarok and their sister Hela (Cate Blanchett).The goddess of death returns from her imprisonment and chases Loki and Thor through the Bifrost portal and knocks them out into space. Hela returns to Asgard and takes over murdering many of Thor's friends. The killing is a bit incongruent with the lighter tone most of the film takes. Thor wakes up on a waste planet Sakaar and is captured by the drunk Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a former Asgard warrior. Valkyrie takes Thor to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who decides to pit Thor against his best warrior, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Thor discovers Loki has already set up there for weeks and earned the Grandmaster's trust. As Thor waits to fight Hulk, he meets Korg (Taika Waititi), a hilarious rock creature who likes to plan revolutions. Thor fights Hulk in a spectacular battle and the god of thunder nearly wins but the Grandmaster uses the shocking device in Thor's neck to throw the match.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

25 March 2018,saru2020,0,2,5,A very normal installment,They kinda spoiled the franchise by adding some humor presuming that it would work but it just spoiled the seriousness a bit. Thor w/o hammer was a bit unpredictable and nothing else was. Just a very normal second installment.
16 November 2017,elale-573-971300,2,7,9,great action! great fun!,"This might be the best Thor movie yet. It has great action, with lots of fighting. The effects are smooth and believable-looking, and never gave me any of that out-of-sync or blurry nausea that earlier CGI sometimes did. A few things I loved:I loved how Surtr looked. He was almost exactly how I pictured him when I wrote my own novel about Ragnarok (which is not published, you can't read it anywhere.) I loved Loki's emotional moments with his family. The expressions on his face told whole volumes of stories in just a few seconds of screen time. I loved that they had to destroy Asgard and fulfill Ragnarok. Did I love that because it dovetailed with my own vision, in my unpublished behemoth? Probably. But it also worked perfectly with the movie's plot and premises. I loved that Loki got to be the hero his fans always knew him to be. Some things I thought I might care about that I didn't:People online have been complaining about the Hela character being changed from Loki's daughter to Odin's daughter. I can see why they did that for this story, because it makes her a proper claimant to the throne of Asgard. It's kind of silly to think of beings that don't age having any tradition of children succeeding their parents, but then, if we wanted a realistic movie about what the heathen gods were really like we'd have to call it Cloud Appreciation or something like that. People online have been complaining about how different the Valkyrie character looks in the movie from how she looks in the comics. I never actually read the comics -- I read the original mythology. Meh, I thought she looked fine. She had some great fighting sequences. One thing I didn't like:The opening scene where Thor swings around on a chain and keeps telling Surtr to wait until he goes back to facing forwards and Surtr politely stops and resumes his villain speech where he explains everything was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. If a moment of humor that didn't come off had been buried in the middle somewhere, I wouldn't have cared so much, but the beginning of a blockbuster should make me say wow. The reason I gave this movie of 9 instead of a 10 is because the beginning fell flat.One last note:My companion really likes Immigrant Song so it was really cool that have that in the soundtrack."
3 November 2017,kenyae-cagle,1,9,9,Wonderfully done!,"This movie was hilarious and enjoyable to watch. This movie was great in my opinion in many ways. First, the intro for the movie was perfect with Thor being captured and making jokes about it. Next, I loved the jokes in the movie with Thor being mostly incompetent with situations making him go from being a god to a human as a character. I loved the fight scene with Thor and The Hulk. I loved seeing Thor make trivial mistakes. This movie just had everything and a bag of chips. Seeing how Thor found out who he truly was I think was a great way to show character development. It was also pretty awesome to see Thor and Loki on the same team together and how they rebuilt their family relationship. I think it was awesome the hulk turned back to Bruce Banner because of black widow it shows that the Hulk has a huge soft spot for her and in general. It was also good to see the Hulk some personality as well from being a gladiator champion for two years. All, in all I loved the movie great job to all the actors in this movie and great job with the Stan Lee Cameo that made me cry of laughter."
4 November 2017,RussHog,0,5,7,Funny,Thor 3 is a very funny film with some amazing action. The best character is the rock warrior who sounds he is from New Zealand. The best scene is when Thor fights Hulk in the arena on a distant planet. Jeff Goldblum plays a funny villain.I do think this movie maybe makes fun of superhero movies more than it pays tribute to them - but at the same time - it's super well made. Chris Hemsworth does prob his best job in the character - he holds the film together nicely and balances out being a hero and a ham. Excellent special FX.Huge waste of Idris Elba.
5 December 2017,boe_dye,1,6,9,"It is like the Fifth Element, meets 300, meets Battlestar Galactica.... in neon.","What made Thor Ragnarok enjoyable was that it stood well on its own. While it would have been helpful to know and understand the events of the previous Thor, as well as Avengers: Age of Ultron, it was not necessary as enough information was supplied to take what was happening at it's face value.Honestly though, it was just a fun popcorn flick.Hulk Smashed, Thor Zapped, and all in all it was just a solid film. No one character outshined the other, and though the dialogue at times was a bit wooden especially with Cate Blanchet's ""Hela"", it was clear that everyone involved was just having fun with it.For the Comic Book Fans, the narrative pulled greatly from the Planet Hulk arch, and while it was not a direct retelling, it had enough elements to make it familiar and not feeling contrived. I personally would like to see a proper Planet Hulk / World War Hulk movie, perhaps where Hulk returns to Sakaar in order to lead the revolution that he in part started.After being disappointed with Thor 1 and 2, Thor Ragnarok could either be a nice way to end the franchise, or an excellent way to jump start it with 3 more proper films that actually get the formula right. This focused more on the mythological elements of the Thor legend, rather than the ""Thor in America"" direction -- arguably making it a much more enjoyable film rather than it being a fish out of water tale.To expound on the Summary, this had the fun of The Fifth Element with over the top, yet not outside the realm of reality and reason characters, the epicness and cinematography found in the battle scenes of 300, and a finale that was very reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica.A solid ""A"", and a film that I will hopefully re-watch once it becomes available in the usual places."

22 April 2018,andrewroy-04316,0,1,6,"An enjoyable movie with good humor and action, but nothing much deeper than that","I totally get the love for Ragnarok - it was super fun and respite from the dark, gritty movies in the MCU. I do think it was effective in being much lighter, and it was genuinely quite funny, with great visuals and good action sequences. While there was nothing glaring that made the movie bad, there wasn't much development of characters or themes and little creativity in the plot. Bringing Hela in was really cool, but she was never anything more than a token evil power-hungry person. I love Bruce's struggles with his Hulk side, but why he went to Sakaar, why he was the Hulk nonstop for 2 years, and how they brought him out were all poorly explained. Plot was pretty rote and unremarkable, it was just more fun and easy than the previous Thor movies. Still not a really good movie, but a passable and enjoyable one."
11 February 2022,ciobanualin-94020,1,4,9,Very funny and entertaining!,"I don't think that ""Thor: Ragnarok"" it's the best movie in the whole MCU Thor's franchise, but it's definitely the funniest. It's probably even funnier than the both parts of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"". Usually I don't like the idea to insert to many funny scenes and jokes in a movie that it's supposed to be serious, but ""Thor: Ragnarok"" took care of this aspect in a very good and decent manner. The humor is not over-exageratted and a lot of jokes are on point.As for the other aspects of the movie, like the storyline, the action and the soundtrack, I could only say that even those are not bad either. The movie has some good and memorable action and suspenseful scenes, which are combined with some very good choices of soundtrack, as you can see in the beginning of the movie, when Thor's fighting Surtur and later in the movie, during the first appearance of Hella, when Thor's Hammer, Mjollnir, is destroyed by her.If you want to have a very funny, full of color and lighter experience (""Thor: The Dark World"" and even the first movie, are darker than this one), which is combined with great action scenes, a decent storyline and badass soundtrack, then ""Thor: Ragnarok"" it's definitely for you."
4 November 2017,robinsonaustin-07490,1,7,8,Popcorn Flick,"Another good film for the MCU. Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe this time concerning Thor trying to prevent Ragnarok - a foretold future event that would culminate in the destruction of Asgard. Things get even more complicated when it is revealed that thousands of years ago, Odin had a daughter named Hela; together, they conquered the Nine Realms, but her ambitions grew to a point that she was cast out by her father, and was subsequently erased from Asgardian history. Well, almost. But now she's back, so it is up to Thor to try to stop this formidable foe.So, I didn't like the previous sequel Dark World, mostly because it came off as forgettable, and the main bad guy was very bland. In fact, he's up there for me as the WORST villain from the MCU, probably a little higher than Ronan the Accuser from Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man's antagonist. But I can say that Ragnarok surpasses Dark World, and is one of the better sequels for the Marvel films overall, though not as good as Civil War and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. One thing I loved about the film was the visuals. The scenes were flashy and very colorful. Some were even surreal to an extent. I guess part of my reason for not liking the Thor movies up to this point was that, to me, the scenery seemed pretty bland and gray. This is especially true for Sakaar, the garbage planet surrounded by wormholes that Thor and Loki end up falling into. The colors make the garbage planet visually striking, so much so it could come off as a real world. As for the characters, once again, they're pretty good. Thor comes off as more comedic here, but he also emerges as a leader towards the end. The Hulk is also pretty great here as well. For one, he can speak a complete sentence here. After the events of Age of Ultron, Bruce had been the Hulk for two years. As such, the Hulk comes off as the more dominating of the two, while Bruce is pushed to the side as Hulk began to overpower him. In Sakaar, he is the champion of the tournament that Thor is made to fight in; really, it seemed as though Hulk was finally in a place that was more acceptable of his anger issues. Lastly, there's Hela, the Goddess of Death. Portrayed by Cate Blanchett, Hela was Odin's firstborn, who is most definitely more powerful than Loki or Thor. For one, she wipes out an entire armed force by herself, she has the ability to raise the dead and use them as her undead army, she even broke Thor's hammer without much of an effort, etc. Her whole deal is that she felt as though she were stubbed by her father, and she desires to expand Asgard's empire, but she needs the sword that controls the Bifrost Bridge for that. She's sadistic, and somehow more egotistical than Loki is. I can say that Hela was one of the best villains the MCU had thus far, following after Ego and the Vulture from Spider-Man: Homecoming. However...my only issue is that I felt that we could've had more scenes that further delved into her relationship with Odin, because we really don't get much of an idea how they interacted with each other other than word of mouth. Even though she's the main villain of the film, her whole scheme gets sidetracked a lot because of the scenes regarding Sakaar. I also did like Doctor Strange's short cameo in the film as well, but I felt that it was doing the character some disservice by giving him a short role.Other than that, another good film in the MCU line up. I wouldn't call it as great as some movie critics are saying it is, but it was certainly a popcorn spectacle."

This was such a great surprise that I wasn't expecting. My favourite Marvel film to date. Hopefully Endgame is better! Honestly this and GOTG2 are always competing for funniest MCU film, because I find them both hilarious. The Asgard destruction scene could have had a bit more emotion but ah I don't care."
6 November 2017,pokedom,2,12,6,Close enough!,"In roughly six months from the time of this review, Infinity War will drop in theaters. Take a moment to think about that; we've gotten to a point where this giant film is possible to make. Now there's only two movies in the way. A Black Panther movie (again, look how far we've come), and this one.I guess I should digress for a minute. My favorite Marvel films (from the MCU) are Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Avengers, and Dr. Strange. My least favorites are the two Thor movies. And the only one I haven't seen yet is The Incredible Hulk, but they did write that movie out of existence in the Avengers so I doubt I'm missing much. So I heard this film which shares both Thor and The Hulk is somehow the highest rated Marvel movie of all time, and naturally I'm skeptical. Better than all the rest? Well after actually watching it, I can indeed confirm it is not. It's very fun and funny and completely blows the other Thor movies out of the water, but it's not the ultimate Marvel movie.There are really good things about this one. There's no pointless Earth shenanigans with Natalie Portman and her friends. There's no more time spent with the extra sidekicks from the other films, they die in the first half-hour or so. There's no over-bloated plot or dumb setup for ""something bigger"" (there kinda is, but it's in an end credits scene, and that's par for the course). Heck, one of the best scenes in the film is when Hela goes into the Asgardian Treasury and inspects all the relics. She shoves over the Infinity Gauntlet people noticed from the first Thor movie and goes ""Fake. Most of the stuff in here is fake anyway."" That made me laugh out loud! And I usually don't do that in movies!The characters are predictably the weakest element of the movie. Thor and Loki and Valkyrie and Hulk are fine. They're as fine as you can get for a movie like this. Hulk was funny, but you expect that from him by this point. When he's not smashing, he's making you laugh. Hela is a really cool villain in both lore and design, but she was kinda underplaying it. She does some cool things and has some of the best scenes in the movie, but she's still all serious in a sequel trying so hard to not be serious. Jeff Goldblum said about 7 billion less Uhs than I thought he would (he has about 15; I counted), but he plays as this weird Willy Wonka style guy that didn't sit well with me. They even use the ""Pure Imagination"" theme! And everything else in the movie is weak.I think the real reason I didn't like this movie as much as everyone else clearly did is because I was expecting... something extra. I knew Dr. Strange was gonna be in the movie for a good while before I saw it, but he's in the movie for maybe 2 minutes. Then he's never seen again. And Matt Damon is in the movie! He plays an actor on Asgard portraying Loki's death scene from Thor 2. And that hit me the most, because I really wanted Marvel to put Ghost Rider in the MCU at some pint. And who would play him? None other than Jason Bourne himself. And he's in this movie as a minor character. Which unfortunately means he's not gonna be in the MCU anymore. That got me really sad. And when Thor and the gang go to stop Hela, they call themselves ""The Revengers"". Uhh... you're clearly DEFENDING Asgard here... maybe call yourself something a bit more accurate... like say THE DEFENDERS (cough cough Marvel start appealing to my wildest fantasies already cough). And then Dr. Strange COULD HAVE beamed himself up to help these Defenders! Wouldn't that have been cool? For Dr. Strange to be in the movie a bit more? Also why wasn't Thanos in the movie? They sort of tease him at the end, but I just needed his face and I would have been happy. Just sneak him in there as Hela's lover or something. Anything is better than nothing!I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and I do suggest you go see it. I'm bummed at certain parts of it, but the good stuff is certainly enough. It's absolutely better than the other two Thor movies and I'm glad I saw it. But I just wish a bit more was done to make it that tiny bit better."
5 November 2017,nikhil_mi2,1,4,7,Of all the Marvel Movies I hate......I think I like this one the most,"This movie is the best in 3d with spectacular special effects and a decent story line. The Jokes are awesome. Probably the funniest of all Marvel movies.But It doesn't have that feel good effect in the end. I did not walk out of the theater feeling gr8. I was entertained lot though. The major problem is that I think the movie tries to be too funny at times. It does not need to be that. Too many parts of the movie were inspired(copied) from other movies e.g Satuur is the Cave Monster from LOTR1, and such. Characters, I did not like one single character, including THOR, who is just kicked around a lot(for a superhero). Even Hulk is not very likable. The Junk trash ridden planet that they have created is what puts you off.Having said that, overall it is a very enjoyable movie."

11 August 2021,Stefan_Loves_Movies,1,7,6,#Movie Review,"Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is a silly adaptation of Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor was changed completely from ""the mighty Thor"" I respect to a ""comedian"". This change doesn't work. The reason why the movie Guardians of the Galaxy worked is the fact that it was the first time seeing those guys on the screen. I had no clue who they were so Marvel could have portrayed them as anything they'd like...on the other hand Thor was already established in the past 2 movies as this ""mighty figure"" so this random change to a ""comedian"" did not suit him.The villain was okay in the sense that she had a sinister vibe but literally no one takes her side. I mean she is Thor's sister but everybody looks at her like this ""evil being"" that must be eradicated ... she has only 1 follower and I wouldn't even call him a follower Skurge. The only reason he obeyed her was the fact that he didn't want to die not because he followed or agreed with her beliefs which is sad. To make the plot more interesting they should have made some of the characters surprised and enraged by Odin's secret , since not even Thor or Loki knew about their sister, to the point where those enraged people switched sides and now Thor and his allies have to fight people they don't want to fight adding emotional depth to the fights or to at least convince them to change their mind ..instead the movie's director goes for the lazy way : a random out of nowhere underground army whom no one has ever heard about just some mere punching bags.The jokes were not the best.. most of them were hit or miss and due to this excessive use of jokes you get this feeling that there are no stakes envolved which is weird I mean a few people die in this movie but you don't really care about them cause Thor will probably say another joke any moment after..Thor: Ragnarok(2017) is trying hard to be equally serious & funny at the same and it fails miserably, the plot is not too bright, wasted potential when it comes to the villain.Now don't get me wrong .. I am not saying that this movie is bad but come on guys.. Marvel released so many movies .. I am expecting every movie to be better than the last and this movie was just not it..it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade.."
2 November 2017,mr_bickle_the_pickle,0,6,9,A more funnier Thor than you're used to...,"It is a lot more funnier then its predecessors. To be honest, I was a little worried going in that it was going to have the GOTG 2 treatment, and it was going to be too joke-y. (Not that I hated that movie or anything, I still really enjoyed it). But anyway, I am glad that it still managed to have scenes that were dramatic or heartfelt. It was a nice balance. And surprisingly Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing. He was a highlight of the film for me. Tom Hiddleston of course is great at Loki. Cate Blanchett plays Hela as very dark and sinister. Shes probably not my favourite villain, but shes up there. I liked that she was kick-ass and actually felt like a true threat. I liked that we got more of Hulk that wasn't just him smashing stuff in fight scenes. Jeff Goldblum kind of just felt like Jeff Goldblum playing another zany character. I mean, his character was fun but I don't feel like he truly transformed or anything. I liked Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. I especially liked her introduction scene. But somehow by the end when it came to big boss battle, she didn't really shine. I remember other characters moments. Thor being able to summon lightning without his hammer is really cool, and is something I look forward to more once Infinity War arrives. And I also quite liked that there was an overall redemption arc to the film. One part of the film that did bug me/didn't make to much sense (and this where I will get a bit spoiler-y) is that they make this claim that the fiery demon guy(forgot his name) is the only one who can bring Hela down. And when he is released, Hela does have a ""Oh Crap"" look on her face. And yet, Thor destroyed him earlier in the film. So why is that Thor cant take Hela down himself? I also didn't like Hogunn, Fandral and Volstagg were barely in the movie and got killed off almost immedietely. I think their characters deserved a bit more. The CGI for the most part was really good, but there's a particular scene that takes place in Norway (or was it Finland?) that was a very obvious looking green screen. And this is a minor quibble, but its not believable that Hulk's pants stay on. I know this happens in all the other movies (and they obviously cant show Hulk's bits) but at least with past movies, I can buy that he wears baggy or bigger sized pants and just belts it so it stays on. But in the film, they had this running gag that his pants are very tight (and had pull at his crotch a few times), so it just feels extremely silly that they stayed on. They should have just done away with it. But overall, I did really enjoy this film. Im not sure where I would rank it. I mean we're 17 movies deep by this point, so I could use a re-watch but I think this is one thats higher up."
3 April 2019,manel-minny,2,5,9,Thor goes daylight blade runner/guardians,I thought this film was great!!! now the addition of sexy Jeff Goldblum didn't hurt but i have a few questions...why did Odin move from this plane of existence? no one knows..is death for an asguardian the same as for any other humanoid?You can either asked serious comic question or just enjoy the film. Its light hearted but it moves Thor's story on abit .I love it!!! the Valkyrie and the Hulk were great additions . I don't want to spoil too much so go watch it..or rent it!!
13 December 2017,Aly200,0,3,8,A Fun Romp to End the 'Thor Series,"Ah the true 'Thor' film that audiences had hungered for. While the prior two films were good in their factors, director Taika Waititi really tapped into Marvel's trademark humor and themes for this third outing of the Norse God of Thunder. Drawing from two storylines (the 'Ragnarok' story arc and 'Planet Hulk'), the viewer follows Thor, his mischievous brother Loki, Valkyrie and Bruce Banner/Hulk as they must join forces to combat the wicked goddess of death, Hela, who happens to Thor and Loki's sister, before she destroys Asgard and the rest of the world.The cast really expands their connection as alliances are forged and at times broken while the protagonists must come together in the end to defeat Hela. 1. Chris Hemsworth really changes his portrayal of Thor from his introduction to the MCU in 2011 . Thor has seen much collateral and carnage from his brother's reign of terror and brief banishment in the first film and 'The Avengers', battling the evil dwarf Malekith in 'Thor: the Dark World' and the battle against the robotic villain Ultron in the 2nd Avengers outing. However facing off against his evil sister forces Thor to trust his scheming half-brother to save their people despite Loki's usual double-crossing. Hemsworth even sheds his long locks in the film and dons a new short haircut (courtesy of Stan Lee himself). Thor even finds himself learning to bond with the moody Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) though the two have never gotten along much. 2. Tom Hiddleston brings his usual lovable charisma to the scheming Loki who has hardly changed his ways since we last saw in 2013. Loki faked his death in 'The Dark World' in order to oust his aging adopted father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) from the throne. However when Thor returns and Odin warns both sons that their sister is coming upon Odin's passing, Loki temporarily puts aside his dislike for Thor and helps Thor try to combat Hela but this truce wasn't meant to last. Hiddleston quickly digs into his bag of tricks as Loki ingratiates himself with the enemy when Thor is captured by Valkyrie and sold to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum in his usual awkward glory) to save his own hide. The God of Mischief's most hilarious moment is his relishing in Thor's thrashing by Hulk in the arena; a callback to Loki's own humiliation in 'The Avengers' when Hulk tossed him around like a ragdoll. Despite his backstabbing ways, Loki does come through for his brother when leading all the former workers of the Grandmaster's planet to Asgard in order to take down Hela and her undead army. 3. Tessa Thompson joins the ragtag bunch as Valkyrie, a former warrior of the same name, who makes her living as a scavenger due to bitterness at losing to Hela many moons before the film's events. While the character isn't as fleshed out as the other heroes, Thompson brings a somewhat gritty attitude, but tough persona that shows her ability to fight her battles without being rescued by the male heroes. While initially distrustful of Thor and Loki, Valkyrie's sense of duty does pull out in the film's midpoint as she heads back to Asgard with Thor and Hulk to avenge her long-ago fallen comrades. 4. The lovely and talented Cate Blanchett brings all her skills to her first true villain role as Hela. Imbuing the goddess with a swift cruelty, Blanchett lets her inner bad girl out as she struts around the set like a queen who has already won. Hela quickly establishes her power when she destroys Thor's hammer and sends her brothers packing. Her justice for decenters is equally cruel, having the foolish Skurge (Karl Urban) serve as her executioner. Even nastier is Thor losing his eye to her during their duel to the death; talk about serious family drama.The film's humor is sharp as ever especially in callbacks to earlier Marvel films such as the ""Avengers"" films. Loki and Hulk have some of the funniest jabs to throw at the title hero like Hulk's fire comparison or Loki's disdain of being used as a battering ram in the 'Get Help' plan. The visuals are impressive with thunder blasts, the fiery Surtur and his underworld plus destruction near the end of the film and the new worlds like the Grandmaster's planet. The story is well crafted and gripping as we watch the characters band together and help build the groundwork for 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity Wars""."
3 November 2017,rohitkray,4,9,6,Funny but shallow,"Thor: Ragnarok is the kind of movie that makes you laugh out your lungs. The background score and the colour palette is jolly, along with the theme of the movie. But, for a moment there, I couldn't realize what movie I was watching, Guardian of the Galaxy or Deadpool or a Thor movie. Unlike it's predecessors, Thor: Ragnarok is light hearted and action packed. But, it seems like Marvel studios are not interested in making a good movie, rather would create money-spinners. I've got no issues with that, unless the jolly ride felt like forced down my gut, or stretched beyond the Hook's limit. I couldn't appreciate it, as I thought I would. Thor: Ragnarok, is the most successful movie of the Thor franchise, but one of the most shallow of the set."
10 March 2018,blrnani,0,3,7,A new lease of life for the series,"Although I actually prefer the first two films I have to give credit to this really fun film for having given the entire Thor franchise a new lease of life. Thor's romantic relationship with Jane has run its course and other baggage that limited where the stories could go has been cut away. And crucially, the writers have gone for a strong dose of humour that is thankfully more along the lines of the Avengers and Iron Man franchises (rather than the pre-adolescent level that weakened Guardians 1 and sunk Guardians 2). After all, if the franchise is to be free to follow potentially preposterous directions, it's essential to lace it all with humour that keeps the ball rolling and doesn't take itself too seriously - which I gather spoiled some people's full enjoyment of the first two in the series."
10 May 2018,gcsman,0,0,8,"Great on its own, but also a crafty prelude to Avengers 3 and 4","Clever guys, these Marvel Cinematic Universe planners -- Kevin Fiege and the rest. Like it or not I have to give them credit for thinking way down the path, which they have the confidence to do now that they've established a mega-successful franchise. Every MCU movie is linked not just to the next one but to the entire set. Now that I've seen Avengers Infinity War, a reasonable way to look at Thor Ragnarok is as a prelude to that and to Avengers 4 coming next year. I liked Thor Ragnarok quite a lot -- it covers an amazing amount of ground in its 2:10 run time, has a great cast list with impressively excellent actors (Anthony Hopkins, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch -- wow.) And Chris Hemsworth really owns this role as Thor now: he can be serious, relaxed, funny, whatever the scene calls for and he puts it across comfortably. And of course the visuals, sets, production values are all as expertly crafted as Marvel has ever done up to this point. In short, it's great to look at and easy to settle into for a fun ride. We start with a great segment between Thor, Loki, and Dr. Strange, move from there to reconnect with Odin and introduce Hela, then (zip!) on to the Grandmaster's planet and join up with the Hulk, then finally the return to Asgard. With all these disparate pieces and drastic changes of tone the whole thing could easily have fallen apart, but director Taiki Waititi pulls it off with energy and humor. Kudos to him. Also, kudos for his great voice acting as Korg, the rock creature on Planet Hulk. He's utterly charming and actually does steal all his scenes.But I still rank the first Thor (2011) as one of the half-dozen best superhero movies ever. Thanks to director Kenneth Branagh it beautifully straddled the mythological Asgardian world with ""everyday Earth"" and made it work. Most crucially of all, it gave us a classic, meaningful storyline with emotional resonance: it didn't skimp on action but the action itself was not the heart of the film. Thor: The Dark World (2013) gave us more of the same Asgard-centered setting and action, it wasn't bad at all, but just not put across with the same conviction, and it kind of led to a dead end for the characters.But now Ragnarok: yes it's great but there were nevertheless things about it that bothered me -- for example, in Thor I and II, Asgard is clearly just one of the Nine Realms, in line with Norse mythology. It's essentially in a different dimension than Earth (= Midgard) and to travel between them you had to go via the magical Bifrost. But now MCU seems to have decided that Asgard is just another place in space that you can travel to or from via regular old spaceship -- as we see at the end of the film. This is a BIG change of direction -- it brings the Asgardian 'gods' down to the normal superhero level like Iron Man and Falcon and all the rest. And the Asgardians themselves, who looked terrifically noble and impressive in Thor I and II, here look like just what they are, which is a bunch of casting extras off the street. I'd rather have Thor still be special and I'd rather have Asgard be Asgard.And his hammer -- broken up by Evil Sister Hela almost at the beginning of the story. ??? This is an equally dramatic step away from Thor's Norse mythological roots. In fact there are lots of versions of Thor in the stories, including a period in the Marvel comics where Thor was even a woman, Jane Foster -- but there is NO version of Thor without the hammer. I came out of the theater thinking ""Hey, bring that back! No fair!"" Yes, I know -- the dramatic purpose was to make Thor realize that his trademark self-confidence needs to rest within himself and not Mjolnir.This film is also the first serious indication that as the MCU develops, they are willing to start playing real hardball. Trashing the hammer, putting out one of Thor's eyes (ow! gee thanks, Sis), and even Ragnarok itself where all of Asgard is brought down, are messages that they are not just going to continue their movies with the same-old types of stories. As we know by now, Infinity War goes one step further. But I also draw some hope from AIW, because Thor gets an eye back and also the newer and better hammer, Stormbreaker. It was a setup all along. So the MCU writers might seem bloody-minded but they still need to make it all good in the end -- now it's just taking a series of films to do it, not just one standalone story at a time."
3 November 2017,Ingrouille181,1,8,7,"Definitely does for Thor, what Age of Ultron does for the Avengers.","I've been wanting to see another Guardians of the Galaxy esque film in the MCU, and never fought there's be one starring Thor, much less a Thor sequel. Ragnarok is the latest MCU film, and by this point I'm glad these movies are going a bit more silly, in a good way. The comedy is placed well and doesn't feel forced.Our story takes place two years after Age of Ultron. Thor has been serving Asgard well, but discovers that Loki had not only faked his own death, but had been disguising himself as his father Odin. Despite ultimately finding Odin, he dies, freeing a deadly new enemy, Hela, the goddess of death. Failing to defeat Hela at first, Thor and Loki soon make their way to the planet of Sakaar, when Thor is forced to fight the planet's champion; that champion being Bruce Banner, better known as the Hulk. It's up to Thor, Loki, the Hulk and a new hero, a Valkyrie, to return to Asgard and defeat Hela once and for all, and stop the doomsday event, Ragnarok.The thing I loved best about this film is the chemistry between the characters. Helmsworth and Hiddleston are amazing in their roles, and seeing them talk with each other is something I could honestly listen to for hours. Though Helmsworth and Ruffalo don't get too many scenes together in the MCU, it's fun seeing them play off each other. Our newcomer Valkryie, is also pretty interesting; she fits the Black Widow or Pepper Pots role more or less, but I like her backstory and her connection with both Thor and the Hulk. Another character I wanna mention is Skurge played by Karl Urban. I didn't get too much of his character or his motivation, and Hela seems to make a point blank and humorous point about it, but I ended up liking the choices he made at the end and felt sorry such an interesting character got killed off.Would have also like to have seen more of Heimdall, or the Warriors Three, or even Sif: where did she go? One character I didn't really care for was the Grandmaster, played by Jeff Goldblum. He's just, Jeff Goldblum; that's it. At least Benicio del Toro gave it some effort as the Collector. And also, before I forgot, the giant wolf monster Fenrir is only in a few scenes, and he's just the big bad guy Hulk has to fight at the end.What else is there to say. The directing is amazing, the writing is well done, the acting is great, the CGI is amazing, the story is fun and interesting. Definitely a film I'll be buying on blu ray. I've seen the leaked footage for Infinity War, so at least it's interesting to know what happened before that movie, and it's a pretty awesome prelude."
4 November 2017,AnishMisra,0,6,8,Thor: Ragnarok Review,"Thor: Ragnarok is a film directed by Taika Waititi. The trailers that had come for the film excited me quite a bit for this venture. And somewhere in my heart, I felt that this was going to be the best Thor films. NAd after seeing the film, I can say in all happiness that it is.Plot: Thor imprisoned in Sakaar must escape the place and save Asgard from the wrath of Hela.Story and direction: Right from the very first shot of the film, you get the film will be an entertaining one. Thor, I guess was not utilized nicely in the previous 2 solo ventures, because of which many people didn't love the films. The first 2 films were OK but had nothing that made it special. But Taika Waititi takes all of what we know about Thor and gives his own kind of spin. This film is a fun filled ride from the start to the finish. But this film is just not about jokes. It has a wonderfully written story woven into it. The characterization is awesome in this film. And I can go on with the VFX of the film. The 3D just enhanced the fabulous and stunning VFX of the film. I liked the Game of Thrones reference in the film (the scene where actors enact scenes from the previous films). The score of the film was awesome too, It was soothing to listen to ""The Immigrant Song"". Given that at least 80% of this film was improvised (as Taika Waititi suggests), this is a great film. Because it takes only moments when improvisation just goes haywire. But this film is not all perfect. The faults I noticed were with the finale, where I could see how the film will end. And also the jokes. They say that too much of everything can be harmful. In the same way, I can say that the jokes at one point became little too much.Performances: Chris Hemsworth was once again great as Thor. This film gave a whole new dimension to the character. Tom Hiddleston was again great as Loki. Anthony Hopkins was also good as Odin. Tessa Thompson was fabulous as Valkyrie. Hope to see her in future MCU ventures. Jeff Goldblum was amazing as the Grandmaster. It was always a delight to see him. Taika Waititi was good as Korg. Didn't know the director had this talent hidden under him. Idris Elba and Karl Urban were also great in their roles. Bruce Banner was very funny in the Hulk scenes especially. And finally, Cate Blanchett. She was one hell of a badass in the entire film. The viciousness was excellently portrayed by her.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be during the final scenes, where Thor helpless says his father that he won't be able to defeat Hela because she is too strong. But then Odin says, that he is stronger than Odin himself. That scene impacted me a lot and said that people must never give up and believe that everything is possible if you put your mind to it.Verdict: Thor: Ragnarok is certainly the best of the Thor trilogy. And it has opened up new dimensions in the MCU franchise. Just can't wait for the next MCU film, Infinity War. And yes, there is a mid and post credit scene.I am going to go with an 8.5/10."

                        ",Marvel makes masterpieces,"Recent Marvel movies were just brilliant. The directing and plot are always top-notch and the story events are linked very well to each other. Marvel movies probably have the best CGI in movie industry and look very well. 
One of the things which I'm really glad about is that I didn't watch the trailer before watching this movie. If I would watch the trailer then I don't think I would rate this a 9. The Hulk made this movie so much better, I had no idea that Hulk is gonna be in it! 
What's special about this Thor movie is that it has a lot of humor and jokes and some of them are weird, but it did make it more interesting.I think I didn't give this movie a 10 because some of the jokes were too much and there were some kind of ridiculous things in plot which didn't seem very realistic or were cliches.I didn't really expect this movie to be this good, but I love how Marvel brings all their movies together into one big story. It will be amazing to rewatch them all in like 10 years"
4 November 2017,freddyj8882002,2,13,10,"Great Movie, Hollywood loves us again.","My daughter and I saw it this morning and all I can say is that it was worth the money paid. Compared to the crap that they have been putting in theaters this year, this is a masterpiece. Go see it, it is fun and funny. Those of you that know the Marvel Universe will find the script really well done and very unique. I give it two thumbs up and 10 out of 10."
19 October 2017,gonzojazz-1,41,163,5,Trailer was better (and that says a lot),"I really had high hopes for this but was sorely disappointed. The characters were flat, the plot predictable and the jokes were trite. And what the heck happened in the costume department? It was like watching the 90s Australian kids TV show 'Tribes'! Oh, and lest we forget: everything was obviously shot on blue screen and the scenery was over- the-top CGI. No more Marvel for this (ex) fan!!"
3 November 2017,pal05052003,0,5,9,"Thor has to prevent Ragnarok; the end of Asgardian world but has to face the powerful Hela, Goddess of Death","This is brilliant superhero movie. It has a perfect combination of humor, action, and thrills. The visual were excellent and soundtrack keeps the pulses pumping. Chris Hemsworth really shines in this movie and for once you can actually see Thor as a formidable superhero. Cate Blanchett plays Thor's nemesis and is the perfect villain. She literally kills in the movie, and we can see her motivation and feel her anger. But that is to be expected for an actress of Blanchett's caliber. What is astounding is that she actually delivers in spades. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk also gets to shine in this movie, and for once he seems an integral character to the movie, not just a side character. We even see Idris Elba's Heimdall get some action too. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is still intriguing, and has brilliant chemistry with Hemsworth's Thor; as always. In short, this is one movie where all important characters get to shine and showcase their awesomeness. The movie also showcases one of the best, if not the best superhero smackdowns in cinema: Thor vs Hulk. The pacing and storytelling is brilliant and continuously keeps the audience guessing what will happen next. In other words, Thor: Ragnarok is a superhero movie made correctly."
18 February 2018,galdeene,5,10,1,"It's the Apocalypse, but funny (not really)","This movie is garbage. Awful, smelly, butt-wipe garbage. Thor, the lead character, is an idiot. His three best friends die, and he does not react at all. His father is dead, and he's sad for five seconds. Hulk? Also stinks. Hela? stinks. 
Don't waste a dime on this movie. It's another example of Marvel's inability to make an actually serious, good movie. Black Panther is an outlier."
4 July 2022,MatthewMichaelHoffman,0,0,10,"Asgard is not a place, but a people","SCORE: 9.9/10The difference in quality between the first 2 Thor movies and this one is insane. Ragnarok is an absolute powerhouse of a movie that has some of the funniest moments in the entire MCU and I am not surprised to hear that most people regard this to be one of the best Marvel movies that's been made.To start, the scene between Luke Hemsworth and Matt Damon was hilarious and the fact that they were able to be casted in this was awesome. Then, within a very short period of time, we find out that Loki is still alive and even get a quick trip to see Dr. Strange. From that point on, it was interesting to see how Taika effectively split the plot into 2 different storylines. On the one hand you have Thor visiting Sakaar where he meets the Grandmaster played by Jeff Goldblum and Korg played by Taika Waititi himself. He faces off against Hulk and their banter is top tier. We are also introduced to Valkyrie and Tessa Thompson dominates in that role with an amazing performance. Completely happening in a different storyline, you then have Hela, who was one of the coolest villains I've ever seen. The only crime of this movie was her not getting enough screen time.This was a huge movie for Thor as a character. His power transformation during his fight with Hulk pushes him to the forefront of the conversation for strongest Avenger and he learns that Asgard is not a place, but a people."
4 November 2017,anupapu8,0,4,8,This Is Fun . A Really Funny Film. Better then both the GOTG films,"Thor: Ragnarok- THIS IS FUN . A REALLY FUNNY FILM. BETTER THEN BOTH THE GUARDIAN OF THE GALAXY FILMS(yes the first one too) WITHOUT TAKING BACK ANY CREDIT FROM THOSE TWO MOVIES. And thats totally because of Taika Waititi , the director who i think is far superior a director then James Gunn. And there was writing too. Not just senseless fun , like GOTG 2. Nor its kind of immaterial like Ant Man , or Heroes just having fun like in GOTG1. This movie have serious consequences , in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe same as like Cap America 2&3 which makes it better then GOTG 1 & 2 , Ant Man and even Dr Strange , but because its never serious it falls behind Cap America 2 & 3. But enough of comparisons now.The storyline establish itself without wasting any time. Just some background connection with part 2 , quick introduction of Main villain HELA , and Thor find himself in another planet captured and unwillingly fighting with HULK , who was very happy to fight anybody , without becoming Bruce Banner in last 2 years. In the subplot or you can the other parallel story Hela is trying to capture Asgard , and Thor want to stop her by freeing himself first. The movie is like when you give an imaginative child a big and costly toy with a lot of abilities and he can do whatever he wants with it. The same happens here. Taika Waititi is a very imaginative director with a very very weird deadpan sense of humour(which i loved in his previous films). So when he got full control and a marvelous budget of 185m$ , the result is great. The close i can compare this movie to Pacific Rim , another movie made by an imaginative director taking control over huge budget and playing with it as he likes. Jokes were the most important part of the film. They just keep on coming. And raise the bar so much that you find such scenes slight boring when comedy was not happening. Most of them which were with the character of Hela whose story got a little sidetracked , even after Cate Blanchett providing really good performance making Hela one of the best villain in MCU. As there were whole bunch of jokes in the whole film , its impossible to mention them , but one of my favorite was when HULK beat THOR in the exact manner like he beat Loki in AVENGER 1 and watching this make Loki shout ""SEE THATS HOW IT FEEL"". It was hilarious. I had a feeling before watching the film that this doesn't become an all n all comic film , and the action got sidetracked . But that doesn't happened. The movie is full of action sequences and each and everyone of them was great. When THOR becomes the true God Of Thunder , it will make u jump with happiness. The directer have done everything you would expect , he didn't pulled back anything. Its so nice to see that Taika Waititi can handle action scenes so nicely , as he will probably direct The AKIRA live action film for WB. Also a small mention of DR STRANGE in one scene cameo . Taika Waititi make his powers look so much fun in his 10min role that scott derrickson was not able to do in the whole film. Which again makes me wonder that its more probably a chance that Marvel will give him Thor 4 to direct , but how much fun it would have been if he will direct Dr Strange 2. Because believe me , this movie have much more magic then Dr Strange had. Oo and yes , how can i forget the music. A perfect blend of Retro , 80's Rock and 90's Trance. U are gonna love it. Again better then GOTG 1 . I think i have to say it at last , its not the best but probably the most fun MCU film till date . 8.2/10by ANuP APu KuMaR"
14 March 2018,swchamberlain,1,2,6,Tries too hard to be Deadpool...makes movie a big joke,"Thor Ragnarok overall was a good movie, plenty of action, good story, but went way overboard with a comedy. I like a good laugh as much as the next person but I felt that this movie just went over the top, to be something that it's not, with the tongue and cheek routines. After awhile it became more of an annoyance since, to me, it seemed like the writers were just trying to mimic the success of Deadpool's unique character, which, after awhile negatively impacted the overall feel of the movie. Other than that Bruce banner was way out of character, nervous, absent minded, ditsy even... He turns into a giant green monster, he warded off other monsters, saved earth from invading aliens, but then is so shaken because he cant believe he is on another planet... then jumps out of a plane to turn back into the Hulk and is squashed on the pavement breaking every bone in his body in true Deadpool fashion before accomplishing his main goal... I mean come on.... turned into the Hulk at will in the Avengers, had to keep his squirrely self from having an anxiety attack so that he didn't change back through half of this movie, but then had to be squished on the road after falling several stories, with a humorous close up...It just wasn't right for the film.Finally the end battle should have probably stuck with a Thor style theme like ""Sons of Odin"" instead of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."" It was one thing in the beginning but for the final battle it jumped from fanfare style orchestra music to this and it just didn't work...You are watching intensely at the battle about to start, everything is serious, things are about to break, worlds are about to end and then suddenly... oh we are back to a joke."
13 November 2017,HockeyFan13,1,4,6,Temper Your Expectations. Thor: Ragnarok is just OK.,"Spoilers below. I am of the mind that not everything has to be a joke. The Good? Blanchett is excellent as Hela. The best villains are ones who believe they are right and make a great case for what they are doing. She is the rightful air to the throne. Idris Elba gets to sink his teeth into something a little more meaty than standing around in gold armor unlocking the Bi-Frost. Valkyrie is excellent also. People have said Its good Hulk got to show some personality. He always does.. he just never really talked before. I like Hulk being more than he was in the past but its not without some problems. Now the questions - Why is Thor all of a sudden a slapstick comedian telling joke after joke if he thinks his whole home world is in danger and his father just died? Why could Odin deal with Loki an adopted frost giant, but not Hela his own daughter? He couldn't put his foot down and tell her hey... we're doing this now. Stop the fighting. Why doesn't Banner remember anything while he is the Hulk? How was Molnir destroyed? Every living Asgaardian fit on that one ship? What are there... like 2,000 of them? That was a whole planet destroyed. Must be a small planet. All in all it was a good movie - Not a great one. You would think with his whole planet and every living inhabitant threatened Thor would not be reduced to being Jerry Seinfeld cracking jokes every other sentence."
3 November 2017,bj-bijaya,2,5,7,"Best Thor movie till date, but not the best from MCU","Thor: Ragnarok is beautifully made. The comic timing is great, the action sequences fill you with energy, and of course the acting is good. The director deserves a round of applause.What I like the most about this film is - it is ""Asgardian"" film. The setting makes you feel like you are watching a Thor film, completely detached from influences from Earth (even though Dr. Strange is there for some few minutes).But with all this said, Ragnarok is still missing that 'conflict' and 'resolution' balance that otherwise all MCU films had (except perhaps Spiderman: Homecoming. That film was bad).The conflict between Thor and Hela is more of who-threatens-who more rather than who is fighting whom. She is a menacing villain, I agree, but her intentions aren't clear. She is freed from her prison and hopes to win over Asgard. Why does she, then, wait for such a long time to do so? Was Heimdall her worthy adversary then? Or, was she simply waiting Thor's return? What was stopping her from causing havoc/Ragnarok of her own? Also, (SPOILERS AHEAD) when Thor realizes Ragnarok is bound to happen, why does Hela try to save Asgard? Did she not realize that ""Asgard is its people?"" Seems like she was closer to Odin than Thor ever was (she was his 'executioner' for crying out loud!)Technically and via its story, Thor is the best in its own series. Seeing the funnier side of Hulk, and the eye-candy Mr. Goldblum was just too satisfying. But the end battle and sequences, the justification of the film's ending, motif of Hela, and obviously motif of Loki is somewhat misleading and/or not defined properly.I rate this film 7/10. Best Thor movie, but not the best from MCU."
27 February 2018,ChipperX,1,6,10,"Good, Messy, Seventies-Inspired Fun.","Thor - Ragnarok (2017).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has banished Odin (Sir Anthony 
Hopkins) on earth, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) discovers upon 
his return to Asgard after a prolonged absence. With the 
help of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Thor 
soon locates Odin, only to discover the true first-born 
of Odin - a sister named Hela (Cate Blanchett), The 
Goddess Of Death, is bent upon the destruction of the 
nine realms and her place upon the throne of Asgard.Hemsworth as Thor is a member of the Marvel group of 
superheroes - he also has the special classification of 
deity. Imagine my surprise when director Taika Waititi 
allowed Hemsworth to improvise, inserting comedic one-
liners throughout Ragnarok, the movie which completes 
the Thor trilogy. Is it a superhero movie, or a comedy? 
The fact that it vacillates effortlessly between the two 
classifications is a testament to the talent of the 
ensemble cast.The year 2016 brought forth a plethora of genre-bursting 
comedy-inspired Marvel movies. The phenomenal success of 
Deadpool (2016), Doctor Strange (2016) and Suicide Squad 
(2016) was prophesied by the arrival of Ant-Man in 2015 
and Guardians Of The Galaxy in 2014. After Guardians Of 
The Galaxy: Volume 2 and Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017, 
it was clear that the industry viewed comedy as a key to 
its financial success at the box-office. But is comedic 
intervention a welcome distraction in movies meant to 
immortalize the human spirit, as larger-than-life heroes 
right the wrongs of our society on the big screen? If 
you enjoyed Ragnarok, the answer is clearly yes.Blanchett as Hela is the straight man, while Hemsworth 
(Thor), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Tessa Thompson 
(Valkyrie) and Hiddleston (Loki) all take turns poking 
fun - and holes - into the plot with well-timed puns, 
jokes and quips - and for the most part, this strategy 
works. Writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher 
Yost give the actors plenty of combustible material to 
work with, but rumor has it Director Waititi allowed the 
cast to improvise 80% of the lines on their own. When 
you compare Ragnarok to Thor: The Dark World (2013), 
there is a clear difference in tone, style and 
excitement, with the obvious winner being Ragnarok.Other treats throughout the film are the re-imagining of 
Thor's abilities sans-hammer, excellent use of female 
villains and protagonists, the vibrant colors of the set 
pieces and end-credits, and the integration of Dr. 
Strange into the plot. With Marvel thinking on its feet 
and responding positively to what works in terms of 
audience satisfaction, there's no telling how far the 
comic-book-movie industry will be able to go in the near 
future."

                        ",Rags to Riches to Infinity.,"I'll start accepting and maybe even loving Thor: Ragnarok if these 2 things happen;1. Black Panther is serious, tense and doesn't almost belittle deep moments, and2. If Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's most darkest and emotional film to date.Reason being, I believe that Marvel took this route with Ragnarok because their next 2 installments will be serious, so they may have wanted to avoid seeming stale by releasing 3 movies in a row that have this ""dark"" theme to it. Think about it; Ragnarok = light. Black Panther = dark. Infinity War = dark, and Ant-Man and the Wasp = light. Light-dark-dark-light instead of dark-dark-dark-light... That theory to me, makes sense, and if that is the plan, perhaps I can understand... But, if Black Panther and/or Infinity War churn out the same kind of theme as Ragnarok, Marvel, truth be told, will have broken my heart."
13 August 2021,laonephasele,3,12,6,Being funny doesn't cut it,"The movie completely ignores marvel continuity. Don't misinterpret, I love the movie but only because it's stupid. We laugh but even we can see that thor lost a couple of braincells. The storyline was rushed. I believe it was the disney effect. Add colour, jokes and women empowerment ( I'm not against it) and completely ignore storyline. Let me give you an example"" I just found out I have a sister from my dad who died miraculously at the same time we found him. Boom my sister appears and I'm already fighting her...."".

24 December 2021,joe-05763,1,2,6,"True Hulk fans, might be conflicted.","If you're a fan of Hulk, as in...PLANET HULK, this movie might feel like a slap in the face to you and the characters of Planet Hulk.I felt very disappointed that one of the greatest Hulk stories ever, was stuffed into a Thor movie, and passed off as a series of multiple comedic scenes.Now aside from that, this movie was ""fine"". It's so f course heavy on the typical marvel movie ""jokes"", but it's not excessive."
19 April 2018,Eric266,0,1,7,A Very Un-Thor Like Thor,"This movie is fun. It has great action sequences, loads of jokes, the great team up of Thor and Hulk, Loki's return, and some new characters that blend in nicely. And that's the problem. Its too jokey.I don't want my Marvel movies to be dark, intense and dreary. We have the DC movies for that. However, the tone that is struck with this movie just never set right with me. Thor is throwing out one line after one liner. He grins through most of the movie. Chris Hemsworth is a very gifted comedian. Look no further than his role in the Vacation sequel. He was hilarious. But that does not fit well with Thor.Ragnarok is supposed to be the end of times. An Apocalypse. Yet, everyone in the movie seems to be having a glorious time. Thor jokes that Loki has tried to kill him many times, but seems to have forgotten that Loki also tried to kill everyone on Earth in The Avengers as well as nearly killing Odin in the first Thor movie. Thor doesn't need Loki, as his adopted brother does almost nothing to advance the plot. Hiddleston has been a breath of fresh air in the series, but he is wasted in this movie. He is just a foil for Thor, not a rival or friend.The inclusion of Dr,. Strange was a nice touch. The subtle humor in that scene is how the rest of the movie should have been played. Instead they went for over-the-top laughs and I think it damages the characters credibility.I would be remiss if I did not mention that Cate Blanchett looks HOOOOT in her Hela costume. I know that is pretty shallow, but when she first appears on screen, I got a bit warm. I had to pull up IMDB to make sure that was really her. In addition to looking amazing in the costume, she also is a pretty decent villain. Her character is powerful, has a sense of irony, and is actually dangerous. I would have preferred a more serious take on the character. Thor acted more like Tony Stark, than Thor. If they wanted all the jokes, they should have coughed up another couple millions and hired RDJ to join the shenanigans."
30 April 2018,laird-darknight,2,3,1,"Disaster, Its own parody","Give return my 2 hours. This movie is its own parody! There are lot of jokes, which are terrible. What did they do with Thor? He is like a stupid cheerleading girl. ""My hair, do not cut my hair"". I want to forget it!"
3 July 2018,wolfchick225,1,3,7,Took Me a Few Viewings to Appreciate,"I'll admit, my first reaction to this movie wasn't very positive. It was such a HUGE departure from the trend of the first two Thor movies that I kinda felt blindsided. I was pretty pissed at the casual, throw-away deaths of the Warriors Three. I actually said to my mom during my first time watching it (she had seen it before me), ""That's it? They're dead, just like that?"" And Odin's death was pretty lame too, considering the ceremony Frigga got. I also wanted Hela to be more threatening than she was funny; after all, she massacred the palace before her banishment, slaughtered the Valkyrie forces, and laid siege to Asgard. I feel she was made a tad too comedic for her character's own good. However, upon watching it a few more times, I came to appreciate the comedic aspects of the movie. While it felt maybe just a tad overdone, the comedy in general hits the mark. The rapport developed between Thor, Banner, Valkyrie, and Loki was interesting and entertaining. Korg and Miek were funny, but not entirely necessary to the story (but I still like them). The actors worked well together and their chemistry seemed real, the music was awesome, the last battle was entertaining, and the colorful visuals were very fun. I give it a 7 because it's somewhere in between what my original review might have been (5 or 6) and what my newly appreciative review would be (an 8 or 9)."

8 November 2017,victortku,7,17,2,Waste of funny scenes to do Ragnarok justice from the comic book...,"Thor Ragnarok started really good at the beginning until Thor returns to Asgard, then the movie went downhill as the jokes kept coming for no reason. I felt like i was watching SNL with too much extra humour which wasted the whole story build up. Thor has no emotions when his Best Asgardians friends all die, the death of Odin is a wasteful cheap scene that was not written well, you could tell the writers had no idea what to do for this movie, they even admitted that 80% of the movie was improvised.. Hela was probably the best thing in the movie, she did a fabulous acting i really liked her but her role was so minimal, yes we do know shes the main villain in here but her story was another waste replaced by jokes in the movie. Loki was downgrade so much in this movie, Loki who fought the Avengers, the god of Mischief, lowered down by Valkyrie, or should i say "" a"" Valkyrie, which does not justice neither on the actual Valkyrie character of the comic book. The planet Hulk crossover waste useless and could have been taken out, it did however give Thor the recognition it deserve for fighting Hulk as it should be. Ragnarok was a bad as Homecoming where in the end Thor does not defeat Hela... and worse does not even save Asgard. SO much for the build up on his god of thunder awakening Raiden like powers. He literally did Raiden's move from Mortal Kombat... the god of thunder who did not even lose his powers, just his hammer, still gets tasered by a tiny device... Ragnarok was bad, it made Thor the Dark world look so much better. a Disappointment and definitely not the best MCU movie so far..."

It has everything you might need from a movie , cool action scenes , amazing characters, unbelievably smart and fun script . what more can one want from a movie ? And yet it manages to be serious at the same time ( how ? i still cant see how ) we find out that Odin is not the benevolent god and the wise king but rather he had been a monster and tyrant , encouraging his crazy daughter to commit acts of war crimes , then imprisoning her when she became too wild , covering up his misdeeds with beautiful decorations to conceal his past and starting a new . We find that Asgard is not the dream place that we thought it to be but a monarchy based on lies and power ( very similar to what humans know ) and we learn that boring love story with talent less actresses ( you know who ) and a bored brooding hero just makes the poor viewers sleepy and angry , overall this was one hell of a movie and joyful ride . Kudos to all the cast members and everyone involved in it ."
3 November 2017,dting2010,1,7,9,The Lord of Thunder!,"Forget the naysayers and go see this film. To me, it was a combination of Guardians of the Galaxy, The Hunger Games and Tron. Is there a deep and meaningful plot that connects this film with the rest of the Marvel movies? No, not really. It is just fun, funny and action packed. The soundtrack is pretty epic. Also, don't forget to stay for the credits. I have to say that this was a great kickoff to the holiday movie season."
1 March 2018,ladyinque,1,3,5,Not so good...,"Honestly? What happened to the ""dark"" tone of the first two? This is nothing like a Thor movie should be and some people are right when they say that the jokes makes the movie a joke i mean there's not a single line i can take serious in this movie every single dialogue is destroyed by a final joke all they needed was the drum sound at the end of it please!!!
Realy a bad Thor movie a lot of characters were misplaced and unnecesary specially Loki what happened with THE Loki we saw in the other movies specially ""Avengers Loki"" that backstabbing son of a gun with powers and all so wasted and Hulk please the storyline was unnecesary and stupid honestly the director should had place Loki in place of Hulk and make a ""Thor vs. Loki"" gladiator match ya know and i like Hela but she was not enough to make this movie good so this is another movie that falls in the ""Curse of the Third"" scenario just another saga that was ruined in the third act... shame"
21 June 2018,calebschwendiman,3,7,1,Disappointed,"It was just a real big disappointment compared to the first Thor movie. It brought in another character from the MCU (like all marvel movies nowadays), which personally seemed poorly done to me. But the movie just didn't seem like Thor. And I couldn't last through the entire movie."
15 November 2017,targe1314,0,3,7,A silly but fun movie that should have come out for summer,"I was dragged, kicking and screaming, into this joke movie, and came out entertained and happy.Thor: Ragnarok is basically what happens when the Marvel Super Heroes space jump into the world of Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie has the same look, feel, jokes, and soundtrack of the GotG series (and YES, I know they are supposed to exist together! This is the first film that makes it OBVIOUS).Chris Hemsworth, otherwise known as 'Girl eye candy with a tool', jumps into this with a smirk and a fine set of gag reel jokes. Finally watching him battle, not once but TWICE, to the legendary Thor/Vikings song 'The Immigrant Song' by Led Zepplin, was also a treat.Cate Blanchett is surprisingly better looking as a Brunette, having great fun as Thor's evil older sis, Hela (or is it Hell... or is it Hell Ya!)Tom Hiddleston is rather droll in comparison, just 'going through his Loki paces' and not surprising anyone. He seems very annoyed in the end to have to fight beside his brother finally, even though we all know he secretly loves him and looks up to him. He also gets his ass handed to him by a Valkryie, which is strange...Hulk is very different in this movie now, more a giant caveman, he talks!Jeff Goldblum, always up for playing the buffoon, is a bit of a show stealer and very distracting in his over the top performance.Finally, Tessa Thompson gives the guys something to drool over as the fun and sexy only surviving Valkryie, drowning her sorrows in a giganto bottle of scotch and domming Thor like a pro.Again, this show was so Guardians... I'm surprised there isn't some easter eggs in it, is there? Do we see Rocket in the background of a scene, or perhaps Star Lord's sweet ride in the spaceport? I wish we do."
11 November 2017,Sherrill777,1,8,8,Best word to describe it is: Fun!,"I just came from seeing this movie and it was great popcorn fare. Very quippy and packed as full of as much humorous banter as possible. Not every gag works, but overall it is a lot of fun. Okay, first, the best part of this film is certainly the humor. Almost every scene and every interaction is filled with witty quips and gags. The scenes with Thor and Loki are fantastic! I didn't enter this movie being a huge fan of Loki, but I ended the movie feeling that if someone made a movie with just those two characters talking, it'd be hilarious. The actor who played Loki did a great job emoting - his expressions often said more than his words! The character of Loki, while self-serving in nearly every action, didn't end up being unlike-able, which made Thor's attachment to him in the previous movies much more relatable. Other characters were also well played. Hela, the main villain, was deliciously evil - no redeeming qualities to make her realistic, but, hey she's a comic book bad guy; you can't expect much. She brings death to pretty much everyone around her (typical Marvel violence - lots of mayhem and flamboyant action scene, but very little gore) and is established fairly clearly in the beginning of the film as extremely powerful, so the threat to our hero feels real. The actress seems to be having fun with her character too, which is always nice.While on the subject of villains, Hela's sidekick was also well acted. He doesn't have many lines, but his expressions said a lot. His ending was predictable, but I liked seeing his journey to that point. Other characters? Well, let's talk about Thor. As noted already, he's much funnier than in previous movies - and this works for him well! It didn't detract from his character, which sometimes happens when someone is made the butt of a joke too often, but rather you felt that his personality is deeper and he becomes more likable. His powers sort of shift a bit. It was in the trailers, so no surprise that his magic hammer is destroyed, so his personal growth is found in discovering that much of his power didn't come from a prop (except the ability to fly). The Hulk shows up in this movie and I will admit to not loving this character. His personality as the Hulk has grown (he's not monosyllabic any more), but I didn't end up liking who he has grown into being. Oh well. Bruce Banner also makes an appearance and I found him both less engaging than in the Avengers, and perhaps under-used (for such as smart guy, he doesn't seem to have any use for his brains this film). Thor's interactions with both the Hulk and Banner were kind of cringe-worthy as you get the feeling (which Banner points out), that Thor just wants to use him/them. Let's see, the Game Master, Jeff Goldblum, is wonderfully played - you just want to throw rotten tomatoes at that guy! He's so... slimy. The Valkyrie is less mystical and more... alcoholic, than expected, but it's nice to see a strong female who isn't down graded to Love Interest or Damsel in Distress. The biggest weakness, by far, of this film is when it tries to steer away from humor or adrenaline. Sober, somber, or deep moments, squashed in by the jokes, don't work well. Odin has a moment with both his sons which should have been moving, but just felt out of touch with the rest of the movie. The visuals were a spectacle. Lots and lots of CGI. Personally, I enjoyed this, but some others might disagree. The music wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. The cameos of characters from other Marvel films were fun (especially Dr. Strange).Overall, I enjoyed this film and while I don't rate it as the best movie in the Marvel Universe, it's one I'll buy and watch again. For someone going into it looking for some fun action filled comedy, I'd expect that person to be pleased with the results. I'd highly recommend this film!"
4 November 2017,Mickey089,1,4,7,"As expected. A fun movie, but too much content","Take Ragnarok from the ancient tales and some of its major threats, Planet Hulk, a major enemy from Thor, the side kick of another major villain, an ancient being, plus some nice jokes and shake it well to get a nice movie with little substance but high pace and enjoyment and little connection to the characters.As expected from the trailers the movie was nice and enjoyable, but too much content of three major plot lines gave it a high pace bringing it down to the minimum needed to the the movie going. As said enjoyable but nowhere near for example the first Avenger movie.But the most awful thing I found are again some character changes Marvel did. After the for me unforgivable reduction of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 from the major villain to a low life actor (still enjoyed Ben Kingsley's acting as always) now they changed the Grandmaster from an all-mighty being to a joking, sociopathic despot. It felt like to for the sake of jokes.The second mistake is the quickly killing off of the warriors three. They would have deserved a better send off fight instead of simply being killed of two and little fight with the third one.From the acting naturally Cate Blanchett did great, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie stood out as well as Idris Elba and the few scenes of Anthony Hopkins and Benedict Cumberbatch. Everyone else was more or less average. The Hulk as good, but again not on par with Avengers 1.Overall a good 7, but this seems to be the future of the Marvel movies. Overloaded plots for the sake of certain characters, high pace, but little connection with the characters, meaningful dialogues or deep acting skills. But maybe that's what the majority is wanting."
19 November 2017,Humphreywashere,0,6,8,"Fun trip, but why is the heroine 'alcohol' dependant?","Enjoyable and funny with Lord of the Rings thrilling overtones, but was this movie sponsored by the alcohol industry? It is unclear what the principal female protagonist is drinking as she fights alongside Thor, but she drinks...a lot. And when Thor suggests she give it up, she is adamant she will continue drinking. In the opening scene she is clearly inebriated. The writers may as well had her knitting, or smoking substances, sniffing, or even injecting- it wouldn't have made any difference to her actions, motivations, nor the plot. It was totally gratuitous. So why did the writers have her drinking to excess and render her character impervious to this? Was this to make her appear more powerful, or cool? With millions of viewers being young tweenies, and with her character seeming to personify female empowerment and independence, could she be inspirational or a role model? Does this movie undermine the millions (if not billions globally) of dollars spent on campaigns to encourage safe drinking? Key message from this movie: let's all drink flagons of wine/spirits in one hit just like she does! Beware this one significant flaw in an otherwise entertaining movie that renders women as either evil, or admirable, but drunk."
4 November 2017,sachin-kumar-bhoi,3,6,6,MCU has nothing more to offer,"The problem with all the marvel movies is the lack of serious and good villains. Sequels are successful because of good villains, but MCU is making the same mistake over and over again. Hela, Goddess of death was shown to be most powerful till now , but the whole movie sidelined her and it is mostly about Thor and Hulk and comedy. The movie didn't truly captured the effect of her on different characters on personal level. Same thing happened with Ultron, it was like avengers are playing some kind of game and killing robots.One good point with the movie is that, jokes are perfectly placed but as I said nothing new you will see what you have already seen."
10 July 2018,tyronelikesturtles,2,4,3,"Marvel villain problem, but this time they could have avoided it","Hela is probably the most fascinating character in Thor Ragnarok because her abilities are so visually pleasing and she looks so cool and badass. But then they had to kill her. Why Marvel, why?"
10 November 2017,Hassan_Scarborough,0,4,7,Another great trilogy from Marvel,"With the exception of some profanity, this is truly fun for the whole family. A LOT is taken from a variety of Thor comic books but you don't need to be a comic book reader to enjoy this. Fun, full of laughs that aren't forced like they were in Guardians of the Galaxy 2. No cringe worthy moments.The following are slight spoilers so tread lightly. Okay, Thor's new look is from the comics, yes even the very end. The arc was drastically changed but it's from the books. There is ""Odinson"" and then there is ""Thor"" so Odinson does loose Mjolnir. And yes, he has swords, one was actually enchanted like his hammer in the comics. So fear not. For now Odinson is still Thor who doesn't need Mjolnir. And RIP to this sentient being Mjolnir.The good- Marvel shows how a ""shared"" universe is supposed to be. Guest appearances and many characters pulled right from the comic books.Action packed from start to finish. Easy to follow, straightforward plot. Sets up Infinity War without giving anything away. Jeff Goldblum, first looks like The Grandmaster from the books and his eccentric take on the character works well.Hulk fans, rest easy. Hulk/Banner are fantastic in this. Loki is perfect as always.The bad: It's clustered with too many elements from the books that don't make a lot of sense. Thor's look is from Unworthy Thor when he can't lift his hammer anymore but it's mixed in with the King Thor arc. Which is crazy. Cate Blanchett is simply a world champion when it comes to acting. However, the character arc wasn't very good. With the film deviating from the 616 version of Hela to basically make her character seem like a victim, instead of a powerhouse.Speaking of ""powerhouse"" the character of Hela is powerful, and she's shown as such but she fights and throws daggers from the air when she can do way more than that.Both DC and Marvel power down too many key characters for the sake of sub-par deviations from the source.Special effects were good but it was filmed in Australia and we really barely see this beautiful country. I hated the Valkyrie casting and arc. I love Tessa Thompson, but did not like the direction the writers took with this character. Tessa's acting was solid, it's the writing and directing that I have issues with. Another powered down character. Also, Tessa simply doesn't fit. But not terrible by any stretch.Overall, it's still a solid film. Marvel never makes excuses for it's flaws. And the pros out way the cons in this film. If you hated Thor: The Dark World, give this film a chance. You won't be sorry."
13 November 2017,mozziecat,1,6,10,The best of the Thor movies,"Not only was the best of the Thor movies, it is one of the best Marvel movies. Up until now, we really didn't know Thor - I say this because his character seemed a bit one dimensional. This movie brings out the whole character. I especially love the scenes between he and The Hulk - and Hulk talks! You really get to know both characters. Most of all, this movie is fun and very laugh out loud funny. Jeff Goldblum is great as the Grandmaster. Cate Blanchett is, of course, fantastic as the evil Hela and Tom Hiddleston comes back to play Loki at his best (and worst). We are also introduced to Valkyrie, played superbly by Teresa Thompson. The only disappointment was the quick deaths of the Warriors 3. One would have thought they would have at least had larger parts in this movie given the scope of what was happening. Dr. Strange makes a great cameo appearance and there are a few new characters introduced to the gang. Overall - loved this movie and can't wait to see it again and then purchase it."
4 November 2017,selep,3,7,5,Diet GotG,"This move isn't bad, but it isn't one of the best MCU movies. It's a fun, lighthearted romp but if you're looking for a solid theme or even a cohesive story, I think you'll be disappointed like I was.The two things this movie gets right, for the most part, is the action and comedy. It has good fight scenes, especially in the first half. In the third act the action feels lackluster, but decent.Some of the jokes land, some don't. I laughed at about half the jokes, smiled at a couple, and stared blankly at the rest. The (clearly) improvised conversations have the best jokes. I wasn't as much of a fan of the physical gags. The comedic timing overall feels natural akin to Iron Man or GotG, however I do think the overload of jokes ended up hurting this movie, whereas they were smartly spaced out in IM, GotG, Avengers, and the first Thor movie (I liked its fish out of water humor).The flaws in this movie are largely tied to emotions, stakes, and story. Having a rote, classic story is fine as long as there's some connection and depth to the characters. I didn't feel as much as I wanted for these protagonists because the actors, aside from Ruffalo, Elba, and Urban, seemed more focused on being funny and cool rather than focusing on the conflict. Anthony Hopkins looked like he was just there to collect his check and Cate Blanchett was underused as the villain. The other actors were OK to good, but the focus on comedy decreased the level of stakes and emotional weight. This is where Guardians Vol. 2 far surpasses Ragnarok's quality to me, because I cared about all the Guardians and despised Vol. 2's villain despite the film's weaker jokes, and I felt like nearly all the protags had arcs that were developed by Gunn, and the actors thought about them and put a lot of effort into their dramatic scenes. In this movie it was more like everyone on set was like, ""Let's run through the scene a few times and keep the funniest take,"" resulting in good times and good direction by Waititi, but also resulting in my lack of genuine connection to the characters. There were a couple sincere, dramatic moments scattered here and there that featured Skurge, Valkyrie and Hulk, and I wish those scenes lasted a bit longer or there had been more of them, especially with Thor.Then there's Asgard itself. There's very little emotion spared for it and its citizens losing their home, instead the phrase ""Asgard is people not a place,"" is repeated but instead of me feeling inspired by that or sad at the fall of Asgard, there are a few jokes lobbed about the foundation and I am wondering why I should feel sad or hopeful. I think Vol. 2's ending was a thousand times better and more poignant, even with Drax's jokey last line which was well-timed. Ragnarok made me feel like everyone at Marvel went ""Ok everyone hates the first two Thor films therefore we need to get rid of everything in them aside from the brothers and Heimdall,"" so now it's like the first two movies and its secondary/side characters never mattered. This makes the Thor franchise feel disjointed to me, and I'm probably in the minority on this but I'm not interested in a Ragnarok trilogy, or shoving its characters into GotG Vol. 3 to take screen time away from characters I care about.Speaking of which, it seemed like Ragnarok was trying way too hard to copy GotG. Like it kept poking me saying, ""Hey do you remember the funny part in the movie when Quill got electrocuted? Now we're doing it, so we're cool right?"" I love both GotG movies so I should've enjoyed Ragnarok. I did on a surface level way, and while it was fun and funny I wished it would have followed its own themes and style from its first two movies (which, unpopular opinion, but I liked them). I wish the writers had crafted a better story for this movie, focusing more on the destruction of Asgard and the character arcs while giving Thor interesting development and more moments with Loki and Asgardians, instead of turning Thor into Star-Lord 2.0 but he falls over and hits himself in the head. And after having been emotionally wrecked by the true father-son arc in Vol. 2 despite those characters only interacting for 5 minutes, it was a big disappointment for me to feel zero emotion about Odin, who has spent much more screeentime with his sons. Thor Ragnarok copied things from Guardians without digging into the emotional core of the main characters, or following through on their arcs at the end. Sure, this movie looks like a masterpiece next to ""Suicide Squad"" which also tried copying GotG only to fall flat on its face, but to me there's a very specific, sincere vibe to the Guardians which can't be truly replicated by anyone else, nor should it be. In the end, I'll take Guardians (yes, also Vol. 2) over Revengers any day. I'll still give Ragnarok 5 stars because it's not horrible, it has good action and good jokes but otherwise it's forgettable fluff to me. The first Thor movie is better."
24 March 2018,mherrin-43253,0,2,7,A fun solid movie,"Thor: Ragnarok
Directed by Taika Watiti and written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher YostThe third Thor film leading into the ten years in the making Infinity war. This Thor is a straight up comedy this time. The first two had comedic elements but were not as out there in their comedy elements. It's a fun movie. The visuals are wild and incredible. You really feel like you are on alien worlds. It's stunning. I am glad that they went in this direction with the character. It fits right in with Guardians of the Galaxy with one notable exception.That exception being in an effort to subvert the tropes, you lose track of the stakes. You don't feel the loss here. I understand in the movie, they make it abundantly clear that Asgard is not a location, it's the people and their spirit. Still though it's your home, you should feel something for its loss. It also felt like two movies in one. When they are stranded on Sakaar with Jeff Goldbum's wacky ruler pitting people in gladiatorial fights against the Hulk and the other movie being the fight against Cate Blanchett's over the top but Marvel typical supervillain Hela. They don't really gel very well. They both have their positive merits. The Sakaar is funny and wild and terrific. The Hela stuff is fun too for the interesting way Cate Blanchett chooses to play this character. It makes for two solid movies that don't play well as one. Everyone is great in their parts. Korg comes off as unusual because he has a meek voice and genial demeanor. It's certainly different. This was mid level Marvel, not quite up to the levels of Spider-Man Homecoming or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. I give this movie a C."
15 September 2018,freek-40293,2,3,2,A colourful mess!,"Positives: -Nice colour palette.- loki and the executioner were thruthfully and respectfully portayed.- Fast pace throughout the movie. Negatives:- humor is repelling against audience: Loki could have sat right next to you in the cinema without you knowing it. Absorbing what he felt when shooting the movie.- Why dr Strange was only a great bartender in the movie?- Why the hulk talks and has almost the same face as his alter ego? I mean they are totaly different characters. -Why a scientist stays angry for 2 years? He probably knew the outcome of the movie. -Why the film looks like they have adopted many similar acting or looking characters from many other movies? Why Loki doesn't have a great power and name? He's family too.- Why many movies nowadays are familiar with benzodiazapines for too long, including this one? You expect some emotion in this future Disney.- If the makers incorperated dr Strange more in the movie, making realms and unknown realms or making them surrealistic and mysterious and darker could be a bigger entree. Under the pressure of a sinister Hela with emotional deathtraps making it creepier and more thrilling with what's next to come. Something like what Carrie turned out to be in the remake: a superhero with revenge, but with certain drive. And Thor would be the other end: emotionally doing what is right for Hela, himself and the twisted Loki in honour of the pride of their father and Asgard.- Thor also ditched the girlfriend in a local pub on earth with pleasure. Why? She's the one who would have kept the jokes out of the movie. At least for a while.- One other good thing in this movie were no big ships entering realms. Unfortunately it's been replaced by a big wolf who could have ate 10 Hulks for diner with ease. But big wolfs don't like ending landscapes like waterfalls and Hulk is probably not very tasty either."
11 November 2017,signupforstuff-17197,3,7,6,Entertaining but lacking,"I feel that I may be witch hunt out of existence for my thoughts on this film. While I was certainly entertained during my viewing of this film, I was a bit shocked at some of the creative choices done by Marvel for this movie. Ragnorok is the event in Norse mythology that is the end of all things. This turns into a comedy club. While I certainly laughed during this movie, I felt that the tone was rather off. I loved the part of the film that took place on Sakarr (Grandmaster was by far my favorite thing about this film) and anything with Heimdall but I felt that scenes on Asgard, particularly with Hela were a bit out of place. Everyone in this film was a comedian. Thor is a stoic warrior not a jokester. The tone felt much better suited for a different character such as Spider-man or Ant-man. I was also shocked when Hulk started talking and holding conversations with Thor. Thor acts like this was a normal occurrence for them as we haven't seen anything to my memory outside of roaring and the occasional ""hulk smash"" or ""puny god"". I feel that this was certainly an entertaining film but there were some points where special effects were rather distracting (such as the scene with Thor's hammer as well as the special effects used for Thor's eye). There were also inconsistencies with powers especially with Hela. We see her massacre an army of Asgardian warriors but when it's time for our protagonists to fight her she suddenly forgets she can shoot knives and she decides to punch it out with Thor. There's also the terrible scene of her just walking towards the heroes on the Bifrost. I saw this movie opening weekend and I've just been letting it marinate in my head since. I seem to dislike it more each time I think about it. I was already a bit iffy about it while in the theater (starting with the first scene of Thor spinning around on chains) and each time I try to put together a coherent plot of this film, I end up more disappointed. I cannot find the true plan for Hela in this film. I feel that she really doesn't have a big evil plan. At least this film didn't end with a big blue beam in the sky. Hope to see better work from Marvel in the future as they have proved in the past that they can do better."
27 February 2018,Sonolanders,1,2,8,What is wrong with Marvel,"I agree with everyone who said this movie had too much comedy. I don't know what made them do this but this is indeed one of the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. It is so different than other films in MCU.
Every single action sence is just a joke. One of them was when Thor explaining the Valkyrie about the Asgard and took a red ball to smash the window. I hated that sence. From the beginning of the movie Thor acts like a fool. Where is the real God of Thunder? I don't see him in this film. I don't think MCU will survive if they make films like this. Comedy used to be fun in MCU because they were rare. Many Marvel fans may say that this is the best one yet but from my point of view, it is just a peace of useless overrated film.
The other things that are bad about this movie is that how Thor's friends die like they were nothing. Even Thor doesn't care about them. He never mentioned their name at once. Also the mythology is wrong which doesn't matter. But Thor absolutely becomes god of joke from god of thunder. Oh I almost forgot to mention about Jane. Jane is one of the important character in Thor trilogy. But now she is nothing more than a breakup joke. And I don't think I have to mention Hulk. The strongest Avenger in now a baby. Good job Marvel.
Overall this film is just pile of plastic. Feels like Marvel had to put out a film and they did. They didn't care about the plot or what so ever.
On the plus point, the story does continues. We get to see how the great battle is coming closer. Also we get to see Asgard being destroyed which is terrifying. And most sad part was seeing Thor's friend die and Odin's death. It's not that bad. But it hurts seeing favorite franchise not doing so well. I hoped a lot from this film but it didn't returned me favor."
29 October 2017,Diego-Nash,5,16,5,80s? No thanks!,"Let's make it clear: It's one of the worst Marvel movies. Not that Thor's saga is famous for being directed in an unobtrusive way, but from Ragnarock's saga, I honestly expected something different. What is perceived by seeing this chapter in the Thor saga and the total annihilation of the epic and poetry of what is a particular Hero and very different from the others, bound in an indissoluble manner to a strong and epic mythology. Everything in this movie becomes glitterous and stupidly irritating, transforming the atmosphere into an Action movie where you need to make the spectator laugh with any kind of joke, taking away the little credibility left to the Thor package. Once my position was clarified on this point, I would like to say that the actors seemed compelling and the special effects perfect without any banging. The plot that has been developed has no big flaws even though it's too trivial, even for a Marvel movie. I only regret that I have not witnessed a convincing and epic Final Chapter, which left room for an annoying comic spot spotted with special effects and music stubbornly 80. # Stop'80"
15 December 2017,keith-umsted,0,4,9,It's just fun to watch.,"Keep in mind what you are watching. You are watching a superhero show. You will not be enlightened. There is not a brilliant message or message about social issues. This is meant to be two hours of fun, so it back, relax, and enjoy. The story is well written and keep a good pace, so it is hard to get bored. There is a some humor in the show that many may find distracting, but I enjoyed. Some of the Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) the parts seem a bit out of character, but still I don't feel they took away from the movie. I could have done without the Skurge (Karl Urban) character, but still it did not take away from the entire show. You will find Hela (Cate Blanchett) character fun to watch. Now I will say that I feel her parts when too fast. I would have liked to spend more time spent on the Hela / Valkyrie fight. I really would have loved to see much more of the Hela / Odin conquest instead of looking at a few pictures. while the Thor / Hulk story line was fun, I would have liked to seen a the world it took place on be more than the junkyard of the universe with the devil's anus as a way off the planet. There is funny, there is silly, and then there is signs that the writers should not have been writing at 2am after way too much to drink. As always there are some wonderful special effects that give you that comic box Avengers larger than life excitement. Keep in mind you ware watching a superhero movie based on comic books. So, get some soda, popcorn, kick back and just have fun. Put the super critical thinking cap on the floor, and just enjoy the time. You won't be sorry."
7 November 2017,divineone-97986,6,16,6,Not so much Thor,"The movie is not that bad, but not good either. In my eyes it is way to obvious it is a Disney movie. Almost each and every serious moment is ruined by a stupid joke (mostly by the stone dude, who really does nothing at all). It annoyed me to no end. The story line was great, they just didn't make the best out of it. Make comedy more important then the story or the characters itself.The movie starts of with Thor in chains. Nothing wrong with that, not even with the comment he made about turning around. But seriously...once is enough. When the fight started en they introduced the movie...I felt like Guardians of the Galaxy all over again. Nothing wrong with guardians of the Galaxy, I love those movies. But Thor is not supposed to be like Guardians. The music was all wrong en they really just tried to copy the first fight in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It didn't work for me. They invite Doctor Strange into the movie...For no reason at all. I love the character, but it really is just a filler.After that all serious character development scenes and serious moments get cut short. Odin dies in 2 minutes, leaving them behind with a really angry sister, whom they confront for even less then two minute,s in which she destroys Thors hammer, before Like en Thor disappear.The worst about the whole movie was Skaar. Why did it have to be so long? The movie is about Ragnarok, not some fighting on a planet on the other side of the Galaxy. (Again Guardians of the galaxy feel) In the time they have been gone, Hela could have easily taken everything she wanted. Every scene with Hela was great, marvelous even, but she got to little screen time for being the main villain. Her ending is rather short and none eventful ass well. The hulk gets more screen time then Hela does and the movies isn't even about him. Nothing against the hulk, but the should have left him on the other planet, he was happy there. Instead he goes on the epic adventure, gets more screen time then Heimdall or the warriors 3(who are killed in less then a minute and don't even get to say anything. Oh and Thor doesn't seem to miss them.)Our dear Valkery (who doesn't get a name aside from scrapper 142) is really awesome. She adds something to the move, but like every other character her story doesn't seem to interesting to the writers. She gets a couple of minutes in which we see what happens to her and after that...well, she stopped drinking, whatever else she might say. I got the feeling she was a replacement for Lady Sif (who is missing from the movie for some odd reason).Thor and Loki had some great moments. It was really nice to see them work together again, like they did in the Dark world. But I really missed Loki's magic. He only used his daggers, no trickery, no magic. I can go on for a while. But all in all it was a nice movies. It's just to bad that they tried to make it a comedy instead of a serious movie like the other two. Drama just needs to be drama, not ruined by stone face and his misplaced jokes. Some jokes were to childish to (The devil's anus, seriously?) But with Disney in charge we can never go back to the perfection of Thor 1. If you are like one of my friends and just go to a movie to have some fun, this one is great. Otherwise you might be mildly disappointed like I was."
15 November 2017,tdcharacterriggs,3,6,5,Jokes unnecessary for the context of the film.,"If your looking for a good family friendly movie to see, this isn't it. Not just for the language that Marvel has begun incorporating into their films, but the standard of forcing political agenda driven dribble down viewers throats in order to sway them out of the norm of nature. When this happens the film tends to lose value all around. The story diminishes and fades to obscurity and the script becomes cryptic, lewd, crude, and boring. The worst part of this film was near the beginning when Heimdall turned up missing and left the sword to some nobody character played by a name brand actor with a horribly mediocre script. Every character in this film is a 50% reduction of who they used to be in the films that preceded this one. With the trend that Marvel seems to be setting in the wake of this Trump insanity that has been brought about by the producers and directors of this franchise, these films and the ones to come are but a shadow of what the franchise started out as. Hopefully, someone will get a clue."
27 November 2017,dmac5999,2,5,7,"Sorry, I didn't find it funny","If it was an action/adventure movie that had some humour that fell flat, it would've been OK. Unfortunately, they turned it into a comedy (or close to it) with just plenty of action. And I could overlook that kind of treatment if the jokes were funny. They weren't. They were shallow, predictable and felt, for the most part, forced.This comedic treatment also made the story lose its substance. The deaths of Thor's friends, and to a degree, Odin, became inconsequential. Even the impending fall of Asgard didn't carry much weight. Talk about making too light of grave situations. Then there's this ""new"" Thor. Is he powerful or just second rate? Is he a seasoned warrior or a bungling idiot? His characterization was very inconsistent - sometimes great but mostly, just an immature, clueless individual who was 'beaten' by almost anyone in the movie (Hela, Valkyrie, Hulk, Dr. Strange, a group of bounty hunters, Surtur and so on.) Let's not even talk about Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. Linda Carter would mop the floor with this guy! The guy who's arguably the most powerful Marvel character. For the sake of comedy, Thor was reduced to this mess of a hero.The action was okay but nothing really new. Fanboys probably got a treat with the Thor vs. Hulk sequence but the choreography of their fight wasn't done very creatively. They could do better. Just look at The Winter Soldier's fight scenes.The art of the film saved it. Its retro style, coupled with iconic led zep music made it quite unique and a treat to watch visually.Overall, it wasn't a bad movie. Just highly overrated."
27 November 2017,pepedaki,2,5,3,Not quite the expected...,"*Spoilers*Don't get me wrong, it was fun. But you know, it lacked the superhero element. The whole thing was too comical. Serious stuff passed by without any gravity, like Odin's death or the fact that Banner had been consumed by Hulk for two years, or the Valkyrie that lost everything. I mean, I didn't even feel bad when Asgard was destroyed. And the demon felt like a joke. And Loki also felt like a total background character/side kick who was there just to be tossed around. Sure it was good fun and Kate Blanchett was EXCELLENT but there was no heroism moment. Sure Thor was cool when he turned into Rune King Thor, but that had too little gravity in the movie, especially for someone who hasn't read the comics. The fact that Deadpool was crazy successful does not mean that you have to turn every hero into a comical, witty character. Ah, well, maybe I am overreacting but I missed the 'save the world' thrill in the movie."
22 February 2018,tedd0093,0,4,6,Good but still disappointing,"To get this short:
the good aspects of the movie are the good actors, good jokes, great effects, and the God-like soundtrack. The charm and tempo sets off the continued franchise in a way, that gets the smile going from beginning to end. Overall it's a fairly interesting film. The bad aspects of the movie though... 
First is the wasted potential! this is meant with both the antagonist and the setting of the film. It starts off with introducing the villain Helen - the God of Death, which is supposed to be an important character for the franchise! but ends up being wooden, dull and boring in general. She is presented with no personality whatsoever, and with the sheer motivation of ""conquering the world"", which is fine if the character is deep, but being so one-dimensional makes it such a cliche that really falls flat. This is especially noticeable when considering that it's double oscar winner Cate Blanchett playing Helen. This is of course a HUUUUGE waste of potential. The other is the fact that in a time with so remarkable CGI, they put most of the runtime outside of Asgard... Maybe it's because Marvel wanna tie up the franchise in a climax there, but for now it just comes off as a cheap way to avoid any world-building. In the end - this movie leads to nowhere, with almost zero consequences from bumping into the God of Death. Good movie in general, but also a big disappointment when considering the circumstances."
14 November 2017,justin-b-see,3,8,10,They Did Everything Right,"With ""Thor: Ragnarok"", Marvel Studios managed to take a mediocre franchise and complete the trilogy with one of the most thoroughly entertaining Marvel productions to date. In firing Natalie Portman (who may as well have just been whining, ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart,"" for all her lines in the first two Thor movies), they made room for new characters, including everyone's lovable green giant, the Incredible Hulk, the alcoholic badass Valkyrie, and an iteration of Jeff Goldblum where he forces monsters to fight rather than trying to survive them (but only after living in the Hunger Games capital for a few years and then traveling to another planet).There are several moments of genuine humor, a distinct change from ""Thor: The Dark World"", although it thankfully stops short of crossing into the territory of Chris Pratt and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", where the plot is just a medium for jokes to exist. For an apocalyptic theme, ""planet-in-danger"" movie, Ragnarok delivers a constant level of entertainment and enjoyment, successfully escaping the trap of just building up to that climactic CGI battle that is supposed to justify paying to see the movie.Just as Netflix learns from every view, binge, and pause, it is as if Marvel Studios has taken advantage of the last decade of movie making to tap in to what makes an enjoyable movie. I don't mean that just in the sense of developing a standard formula, which would more than likely produce fatigue in viewers, but in the sense of learning how to combine both past successes with innovation and creativity. Marvel Studios has learned has learned what we enjoy, and made a movie that reflected that.The love story between Thor and Natalie Portman's mortal, Earth- residing character was never a convincing source of plot. Natalie Portman disappeared, and wasn't replaced by any other romantic entanglement. Thor is a fun character, but alone he's not quite worth the drive to the theater. In Ragnarok, he was joined by the substantial presence of an Avengers favorite, the Hulk, with the occasional cameo from other Marvel characters fitting seamlessly into the story. Tom Hiddleson's Loki arguably outshines Thor himself, and the third installment of the franchise develops his character, keeping him from becoming a Marvel universe cliché who takes his cue from Trailer Park Boys, beginning and ending each story in prison.If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but wondering if you're at the point where you might just wait to see this one when it is no longer in theaters (let's face it, we all could have watched ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" at home and been perfectly happy with the decision), consider that this might just be one of the additions that are actually worth going to see on the big screen, previous Thor movies notwithstanding."
4 December 2017,ailishcrombie,1,7,10,Marvel's best film yet,"I was skeptical to go and see another Marvel movie not long after seeing Dr Strange. Well it was the best decision. Thor Ragnarok was hands down Marvel's best film yet and one of my new favourite movies.Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Goldblum were amazing! Their chemistry was incredible on screen and there were so many laugh out loud moments! Taiki waititi did an amazing job directing but also voicing a lovable character made of rocks (Korg) who had the audience in stitches! There were so many amazing fight and action sequences in this film where the special effects and the physical effort from the actors was such a treat to watch. There were references to other Marvel films and universes that somebody like me wouldn't understand but the hardcore fans would appreciate.Jeff Goldblum was hilarious as always and was the stand out performer with his perfect wit and timing. There was also a fabulous return from (spoiler alert) Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr strange in a hilarious cameo scene which mucked with your mind and your giggle reflex!Overall 10 out of 10, this movie was awesome!"
24 February 2018,dante440,0,4,10,Absolutely Comical Marvel!,I haven't wrote in IMDB for years now but I just had to write for this one. I've seen some seriously comical movies in my life during the 90's e.g. the wedding singer or so to say most of adam sandler movies. Nothing funnier than them really. But I did not expect this masterpiece just overtook them all. There must be a God up there for presenting this movie to Taika Waititi where he made a superhero movie into a comedy GEM! Not to mention the action and the story was very much impressive. All the actors must have loved working with this guy that they really gave it all to make the movie so much fun to watch. Us fans needed this seriously!!!!! After a horror of superhero era where everything was same and dull. Thor: Ragnarok is a masterpiece that everyone should watch. My favorite character in this movie OF COURSE Korg!! He caught me every time he showed up!!! I'm still laughing my AO while writing this. THANK YOU Taika Waititi!!!!!
29 May 2019,saptarshirekha,1,9,9,That's thor,"Liked it for only one reason------thor!!!!

13 October 2018,facebook-174-672769,1,4,10,Seems most of the people who hate this movie are the nerds,"Ya know, after reading hundreds of comments... it seems most of the people who hate this movie are upset that it didn't follow ""canon"". Who cares. It's something fresh, it's fun. All you die hard fanatics who nit pik over every little detail forget one main thing...How to have fun.You are the kinds that complain there is no Star Trek, then whine when it doesn't suit your precious ""canon"". I'm happy to have Star Trek Discovery. Who cares if it doesn't follow everything perfectly. It's fun, it's entertaining. Take the stick out of your a... and relax and enjoy something.Thor was a blast of fun! Did it follow the precious ""canon"" exactly? No. Who cares. What it a fun movie? Yes. Did it have action? Yes. Was the special effects top notch (in most scenes) - yes. So, quit your crying and go read your comics.BTW - if they did follow ""canon"" and killed off Thor, etc... how could we have more movies? Maybe it was nice to have a different spin on the same story. Did you ever think of that? An alternate ending? Where instead of Thor dying in the comics he does something different.You nerds get so bent out of shape over the dumbest things. Be thankful we live in an age where our comics can come to life. Who wants the EXACT same story as what you already read? Maybe in some cases, sure, but if they don't follow it exactly... who cares. Enjoy the new story line.... and I'm a nerd myself... I program 30+ languages. I get it. but I also know how to have fun and enjoy something without nit piking it to death..."
5 November 2017,henryluck,1,9,9,"Thor: Ragnarok Review: ""Rock and Roll!""","I loved my time with Thor: Ragnarok because it went for that feel good Guardians of the Galaxy vibe while also going in a more serious direction that previous Marvel films even Ragnarok's predecessor (The Dark World) mostly ignored. This makes me even more excited to see Thor again and other Marvel films to see if they go in the same direction as this film does and adds more flavour and excitement to the rest of the Marvel cast.The film centres around Thor (Chris Hemsworth) of course as he witnesses the return of his powerful and demonic older sister Hela the Goddess of Death who in a surprising turn of events, catches and shatters Thor's hammer and begins her invasion of Asgard to return it to it's old conquering and corrupted ways. To top of all off, Thor is captured on the planet of Sakaar and forced to fight for his freedom. With the help of his morally twisted brother Loki, Valkyrie the last in a great line of Asgardian warriors and the most destructive and green being on Earth, the Hulk, Thor fights against time to defeat Hela and restore Asgard. The story may play out like any other Marvel film, but there are some great twists that I won't spoil that I'm sure you'll agree with dramatically change the path of Thor's character.There were also some great and well-written side characters as well. For example, the rock-man character of Korg (Taika Waititi) never failed to add humour to any scene due to his unusually kind and light-hearted personality. Whether it be in the prison before Thor faces the grandmaster's (Jeff Goldblum) champion who is (big surprise!) Hulk, to the assault to take Asgard back near the end of the film.The setting of Thor: Ragnarok was also greatly unique against it's predecessors. The setting of Sakaar looks bright, bold and really interesting as almost everything has bold neon colours and personality. But you also get the sense that the planet is plagued by poverty when you see the lower parts of the world. This creates the feeling of a brand new unique world that actually has depth rather then being just a crazy set piece used to get butts on seats.Don't let the dumb over the top setting scare you. Thor: Ragnarok is exactly what a Marvel film is all about. Grand chaotic fun that both comic book and casual super-hero film lovers will love while also taking the character of Thor in a bold new direction. Here's to the Ragnarok!"
25 October 2017,patchlate,7,23,7,Feels like a high budget Power Rangers episode,"1) It's cheesy - This movie is filled with cheesy dialog and jokes. A bit more than other Marvel movies like Iron Man 1 or the Avengers. To me, it felt a bit too much. The movie could have been fine without the comic relief character.2) Bad CGI - not all CGI was terrible, but if you paid attention to the background images it would become really obvious that the lighting isn't natural and the sense of depth is missing.3) Characters feel immortal - It's kind of ridiculous that Thor can survive immense attacks by blunt weapons and being smacked into a wall easily. As a viewer, I don't know what it takes for Thor to be in danger.4) Coincidences - Everything that happens to the characters are extremely convenient for the story to continue. The amount of times characters stumble into each other by chance is unrealistic.5) Dumb Clichés - There's a bunch. Can't say without giving away spoilers though. If you're watching it, expect good action sequences and everything else from solo Marvel movies."
22 May 2018,alexlachance,0,0,8,Funny and funny again,"The story is ok, but there is great jokes. It missed some serious, it is going to the end of Asgard and they are making more jokes than they care about the Ragnarok. Hulk changed, he talkes so much and he does more than just smash."
19 March 2018,StoryTaker1,0,1,6,Could have been so much more. Unsatisfying,"In short: The humour could have been curtailed, the villain better explored, but love the humour at the same time. And Korg!. 
---------------------------------------------------------
There was a certain Shakespearean quality to the first Thor movie, particularly with Loki. His motivations, his schemes, his pain, his utter mischievousness and eventual complete descent into darkness and its juxtaposition with his relationship with Thor and his family. It managed all this while still having its share of humour. While Dark Word was admittedly dull, I feel this complete revamp of tone was uncalled for. They way they (Asgardians) talked and their differences was part of their charm and has given us some fine moments in the past ( ""Doth mother know..."", ""The bright lure of freedom..."", ""Another!!""). Not everyone has to be one-liner quipping, generic Marvel hero to be entertaining. Ragnarok's humour suffocates the movie and losening this hold even just a little bit could have let some of the genuine heart of the movie shine through a little more. While I certainly laughed along, that was it. Just jokes mainly. Nothing to go back to after 1 viewing. Especially considering how Loki's darkness was so well analysed in Thor, Hela (and Cate Blanchett) is just a gigantic missed opportunity. She could have done for female villains (in her own unique way) what Loki set for male. Hela is Thor's sister, and a hitherto unknown one at that. Is it really like him to immediately accept her as pure evil? Hope she returns.All this said, I did enjoy the humour despite myself. I like how they dared to make bold decisions (although I suppose it's already happened in comics?) such as the destruction of Asgard, Thor's hammer etc. All the characters are so well written and engaging. Absolutely adored Korg, and Skurge's arc was interesting."
6 March 2019,d-sel-vp,1,7,5,Not Impressed,"Well it could have been great, if not for the juvenile humor and feminist storyline. Unfortunately it's just a mediocre slugfest without much punch. Thor loses his hair? Seriously? Hulk being docile? I guess that makes about as much sense as them pushing Captain Marvel as a chick. Yay inclusion.. Gags 🤢"
5 January 2020,kirillkostsov,3,8,9,Lord of laughter? GOD of laughter!11!!!!!!!1111!,"Like most of Marvel fans you probably already agree that this is the funniest film in the MCU. Why Is that?After watching Captain America: Civil War we didn't know where Thor and Hulk were and what they were doing. This film doesn't forget to answer this question.Thor: Ragnarok - funniest movie in the MCU? For someone, the Thor is the funniest film but for others it might be Antman, Guardins of the Galaxy or Spiderman. What makes an MCU film funny in the first place?In this film Taika Waititi showed us new characters. Starting from Korg played him Taika Waititi himself who wants to start the revolution, all the way up to Thor's older sister Hela, played Kate Blanchett. Waititi also didn't forget that there are other characters in the MCU and he involved Dr Strange, played the glorious Benedict Cumberbatch to the film.In this film Thor has changed a lot, ranging from physical changes, like a new hair style to character developments, like becoming new King of Asgard.This was an MCU directorial debut for Waititi. Before Thor:Ragnarok I didn't watch any films from this director. I heard that Taika has a comical style of directing and I was expecting characters to develop in a more comical style. I like how Watititi changed the audiences perception about Thor. As I said this film was more in comical style but Watititi also has included some dramatic moments. Starting from Thor losing his Mjolnir up until the moment where all Asgardians watching how their home is being destroyed.When I heard about the new Thor film, I decided to go to the cinema to see the film. I've already told you about my expectations and I feel that these expectations have been met. At the very beginning when Thor was hanging out with Sutrt I couldn't stopped laughing. In that moment, I realised it might just be my favourite movie in the MCU.Now when Phase 3 has finished, I can absolutely say that Thor: Ragnarok is the funniest movie in the MCU.You may ask, why it is the funniest film in the MCU? There are many funny scenes ranging from when Thor getting from the God of Thunder to a frightened boy who is scared of the hairdresser who is going to cut off his beautiful golden locks to the fight scene between Thor and Hulk. In this scene, there are three of the most hilarious moments. The first one is when Thor is walking out into the arena and sees his ""friend from work"". The second, is when Thor is trying to calm Hulk with the mantra ""the sun is setting"" that he learned from Natasha Romanoff. The third one comes immediately after the second, when the Hulk is smashing Thor like he was smasking Loki in the first Avengers film. Meanwhile, Loki is cheering in the VIP stand. In each scene of the film there is always a joke or humorous moment and that makes this film funny. This is in no small part due to Waititi's comedic vision, but that is not to take away from the excellent script writing and acting."
4 January 2018,bravebear-79002,1,3,4,"Damn you Marvel, you ruined Thor","Basically all of the movies about Thor are bad. They lack cool villains, drama and the fact that asgardians are not gods, but old and powerful aliens -- absolutely disgusting. Has anyone read Ragnarok in early 00's? If you didn't, do it now -- it's epic, not clumsy, like movie, it's more spiritual with magic and vibe of the myths -- those things, that we have never seen in movies. (Well, we've seen thunder in the scene when Thor is nearly dead and it was cool). 
However, movie destroys lore so much, so it doesn't make sense. The fight with Surtur, one of the greatest foes of Asgard? Less than 5 minutes. And why the f*ck, Hela is Odin's daughter? Humour was unnecessary too."
27 July 2018,vandutran,1,2,5,Strange Thor movie,"I was expecting a cool epic third Thor movie. Then I heard from critics it was the funniest Marvel movie. It wasn't what I would expect from a Thor movie, but was open to the idea.But geez, my expectations were so off. I misunderstood funny. It's not funny in the sense that it's a fun ride (like Speed), but it's funny in the sense of.. a comedy! Sadly, the jokes were soo bad. Suddenly every characters are comedians? Even Loki who was a scary evil bad guy in the first, is now a comedian making anus jokes. Like comon!Story wise, it's pretty basic and boring. Why is everyone has to be related? Hela is Thor's sister? So we have his brother being a bad guy, now it's his sister. Next up his twin?I hope this is a one time deal, and the next Thor will go back to being a serious movie. Sorry, but this is not the Evil Dead series."
10 November 2017,nickyjohnp,0,7,8,"""Yes!! We know each other from work""","Marvel yet again has pulled off another fantastic movie as Thor: Ragnarok is full of action, strong acting, a clever script, and yes comedy. We finally find out what happened to Hulk after The Avengers: Age of Ultron. With the directing of Taika Waititi joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he pull's off a minor cameo of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Steven Strange, connecting it to the post credit scene in last year's Doctor Strange. The special effect's are excellent as the effect's were done right not rushed. Jeff Goldblum also joins the MCU as the Grandmaster the leader of the planet Thor get's sent to where he battles The Hulk. Jeff Goldblum's performance was solid, as he was seen as funny and idiotic. Stan Lee makes a minor cameo as he always does in Marvel movies, but this one made me laugh for a while. This Thor might have been the best of the Thor movies, as Thor's full power's are shown. The movie show's how he doesn't need the hammer, but without it he show's he deserves the title The God Of Thunder. Loki's up to no good as usual you think you can trust him but there he goes causing trouble and making you think he finally changed for the better but he's still The God Of Mischief, but this time Loki doesn't think about the consequences of his idiotic action's as Thor can see through his trouble. Thinking deep inside Loki's a good person. The movie doesn't get boring as it will entertain the viewer who's watching it. Marvel movie's take a lot of time, effort, and planning. Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost who were the producers of the movie wasted no time making this movie what it is. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor as he's built like Thor, his acting will cement him as Thor forever as he makes you feel like Marvel cast the right man for the job back in 2010. Cate Blanchett's Hela/ Goddess of Death will give you goosebumps, she's the ultimate villain for Thor to face matching his strength. She beats Thor at the beginning take control of Asgard, and about to launch chaos/war in Asgard. But Thor takes her down, with the help of Surtur who was created from CGI, Hulk, and Valkyrie who was once part of an army of women who protected Asgard but becomes a booze-addled buffoon who remember's who she is and fight's next to Thor. Tessa Thompson did a great job as Valkyrie by acting like she was the character convincing the audience she took the effort to learn the character's history comic book history. The story sync's together as it doesn't leave any controversies after watching the film. Creating the soundtrack to make you feel like it also add's to the story and the mood of the scene. Thor: Ragnarok will always be remembered as the movie where you see Thor's full potential and the long awaited battle between The Hulk and Thor and Thor becoming the King of Asgard and the 80's music is good as it oddly fits."
14 November 2017,agharib12,1,4,9,Nice but ....,"Mmm i liked the previous Thor movies was better than this one. For my taste i found it cartoon-ish in a way The main flow that i found is that how come God of Thunder keep on getting electrocuted over and over, should he be immune to such actions !!!!! Plus there was no need for repetitive scenes of Thor getting electrocuted as well as him spending time with The Hulk in his room just hearing The HulK acting as savage Tarzan over and over Also there was some UN-necessary sexual references given the fact that kinds are 90% of the viewers How come Luck became the master friend they didn't elaborate on that and how come after he was planning to betray Thor he came back to save Azgard For me its Cate who saved the movie as Chris acting were not explored at all."
11 November 2017,juhoonkim,2,4,8,Thor Ragnorok was just awesome,"Thor is caught in chains infront of the God of Hell(Surtur). Surtur explains that when his crown is on fire once again, he would destroy Asgard.Then,Thor breaks out of the chains and takes the crown and goes back to Asgard. When he does he finds out that Loki was still alive and that he was pretending to be Odin(Thors dad). Loki tells Thor that he had left Odin on a building which was being demolished. When, they got to Earth. Loki falls into a portal created by Doctor Strange. Then,Thor and Dr.Strange have a talk about how Thors future is going to change drastically. Next,Dr.Strange teleports loki and Thor to a hill, where Odin was waiting for them. He explains about their unknown sister(Hella),who was prisoned by Odin. When Odin died,Hella was free from the prison. Thor and Loki fight with Hella,but lose. Thor ends up losing his hammer,and stranded on a gladiator planet, also Loki is on that planet,but a spectator. Hella ends up on Asgardand kills pretty much everyone. She then brings her entire army back to life. On the gladiator planet, Tor fights Hulk,however when Thor was about to win, the valkarie(an Asgardian) cheats by zapping Thor. Later,they form a team called the revengers(Thor,Loki,Hulk,valkarie). They learn that if Bruce turns back into the Hulk, he might never be able to turn back into Banner. Anywats,later on when,they get back to Asgard,Thor fights Hella and loses an eye. They resurrect the fire god who destroys Asgard and kills Hella. Then they all go back into the ship, to head to Earth,however a mysterious ship comes over the ship...............The special effect in this story was incredible,all the aliens, scenery, and explosions looked very realistic.The acting was great,too.They looked natural and didn't seem to overact. The camera angles seemed to capture all the scenery and height of the scenery. The music was okay,but it felt that they put on the same music over and over again. The writing felt a little,too humorous, even in the most emotional scenes.Overall,I would recommend this movie if you want to have a fun night out,or if your in a bad mood, this movie will definitely make you feel better"
30 October 2017,pkoh-14249,7,24,5,Guardians of the Galaxy but with much less interesting characters and storyline,"Much anticipated and hyped Marvel entry this year is undoubtedly Thor:Ragnarok. There are # of rave professional reviews out there already on this movie. I saw it this week, the first day it opened in Korea, and I am absolutely puzzled what the rave reviews were all about. Yeh, it is lighter in tone, yeah, it has more humor, and yeah there a lot more special effects, but nah, sum of all gives us a very familiar movie, some scenes very similar to this year's superhero mega hit, Wonder Woman, and some scenes even more similar to Thor's soon to be avenging teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy. You can tell that Taika Waititi who directed this movie, wanted this one to be something very different and new from the previous two Thor entries, a Thor movie that can standalone, but what we get is a very differently toned Thor entry that is not new or fresh, but rather remindful of Guadians of the Galaxy. In my view, this is a wrong turn of direction for Marvel. First, you don't have Chris Pratt or talking raccoon, nor the cute, adorable treelike humanoid, Groot. You have Chris Hemsoworth who can be funny at times but does anyone remember any of the movies he starred in, aside from MCU? So, this time, it was talking Hulk that played the worthwhile sidekick role, and believe me, Hulk was funnier and more interesting to watch. He saves the movie. Thor-Ragnarok also goes retro in it's soundtrack, but also this is far less interesting, auditory experience, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. What they share in close similarity is that the whole story mostly takes place outer-space and this is where fatigue comes to play. We like our superheros because we can relate with them, and they team up and help weak, normal human beings in saving the world, while we watch with awe at their awesome superpower. Mostly this happens here at Earth. That is when it is most fun. Outerspace is already covered by the Guardians team and we don't really need to add more. Also, their superpower status gets bit cloudy and can get less interesting, since our creative human minds will always think and may assume that some big, wonderful creatures, monsters, villains, may just well be hiding deep in unknown space, waiting for their chances to crawl out with their undeniable power. The movies's most efforts are poured into showing good vs. evil fight scenes in dark, outer-space, by the means of visual effects. Story is very simple, something kids may like, but adults may find this movie boring and puzzling by the time end credit rolls up. Hela, the goddess of death, is the main villain here, but even with her awesome, evil power, power that is great enough to destroy Mulnir and to hold back her better known siblings, meets a quick death by another evil power who was somewhat easily handled by Hela's less powerful sibling at the beginning of this movie. Hmmm...Asgard is completely destroyed so, we won't see anymore of Asgard's spectacular, golden, futuristic sculptures, and buildings. We won't see Odin either. We may see Asgardians on Earth someday in some MCU entries. Don't know how that will all play out, but my curiosity is not peaking. Ah, I forgot to mention about the grand master, played about Jeff Goldblum. He wasn't all that funny nor did I feel he played the role all that well, but many reviewers seem to think otherwise. The character felt very annoying and forgettable. Because this one was so keen and focused on just being different, the story leaves out most of previous characters, characters interesting, and important enough, from the last two Thor entries. These efforts to be different and wildly light and humorous while having very little story to back it all up, may work this time around. The movie has a plenty of explosions, spaceships, interesting weapons of destruction, etc. but what next ? By being a standalone movie, Waititi has left Thor alone, lost far out in the space, very well disconnected. This will be a costly misstep for MCU to recover from. They will recover this time, but a couple more of these misteps, and MCU will be competing much harder than now, with DC counterpart."
3 November 2017,Cliff729,1,5,8,Thor's Third: Charm and (no) Hammer,"Roger Moore once described the difference between Sean Connery's approach to playing James Bond and his own as, ""Sean goes out the comedy door, I go in it."" Thor: Ragnarok takes the Roger Moore route. Director Taika Waititi eschews the epic stylings of prior Thor helmers Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor for a Norse-god superhero film that's less Wagner, more Gilbert & Sullivan.It's a crowd-pleaser, but it has its tradeoffs. The filmmakers are far less interested in the Serious Plot—the potential fall of Asgard and subjugation of the Nine Realms (and any other realms lying around) by Hela, god of death and the older sister Thor never knew he had—than they are in Thor's adventures on the planet Sakaar, where he ends up after his disastrous first encounter with Hela. (RIP, magic hammer Mjolnir.) Such back-burnering is par for the course in Marvel movies, especially the more comically-inclined ones (does anyone remember what Lee Pace was up to in Guardians of the Galaxy?), but Thor: Ragnarok loses steam whenever it cuts back to Asgard, and the high-stakes cosmic threat rarely reaches its full potential for suspense.The film's assets, however, outnumber its deficiencies. Of particular note is Chris Hemsworth, giving full display to the comic skills he showed brief glimpses of in his previous Thor turns before letting them loose in 2016's Ghostbusters. He's aided by a deep bench of talent in the Sakaar scenes, including Tom Hiddleston (back again as Loki), Jeff Goldblum (in full Goldblum mode as the planet's Grandmaster), Tessa Thompson (expatriate Asgardian warrior Valkyrie), and a certain green-skinned behemoth with anger issues (hint: he's played by Mark Ruffalo and his name rhymes with Sulk). Director Waititi himself gets in on the fun as the voice of alien gladiator Korg. Back on Asgard, Karl Urban and Idris Elba (among others) get relatively short shrift, but Cate Blanchett, in one of her occasional forays into screen villainy, plays Hela with her usual style and verve.The visual effects are eye-popping, including compositions that could easily adorn a heavy-metal or prog-rock album cover—or an airbrushed van, circa 1976. And in addition to the requisite Stan Lee cameo, a couple of other notables (no spoilers) turn up in fun ""Waitwas that?"" moments.Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is a solid superhero film with appeal for hardcore comic lovers and more casual fans. And while not every future Marvel film should take the Roger Moore approach, this one does a fine job of it.FYI: There are two ""stinger"" scenes in the end credits, one fairly early, one at the very end. They're good, but if your bladder's under pressure, the second is the more skippable."
13 April 2018,mrnajafi-22368,0,2,7,Electric shocker for God of Thunder!!! WTF??!!,"Using an electronic shocker on God of Thunder??!!
Overall story and film making including music, action, etc was good, and for a sci-fi movie it was better than good. I really enjoyed watching it. It had some new things in it. I don't know if anyone mentioned this before.
But But But! Why using an electric shocker to make The God of Thunder unconscious??!! A single thunder can be even higher than 1,000 giga watts, so a simple shocker, or even a modified one shouldn't do anything to Thor. And I don't know why the people responsible for it came up with that horrible idea, and why other people involved in creating this movie didn't disagree with it. It's Ridiculous.
You could have simply choose a chemical compound or something except a shocker. Anything else would have done it.
It may sound like a little mistake, but considering the powers of the main character it's a very very huge mistake.
Most of the time there is some flaws with movies but this much...
With all the resources you got it shouldn't have happened in any case."
2 July 2018,jgstone-99906,1,5,10,Love love love,"This movie was solid - the comedic timing was on point, the characters' chemistry was flawless, and despite all the exciting colors and effects, the storyline was solid. It was also great to see the Hulk's personality more, as we normally just see Bruce Banner and his personality, with the Hulk only coming out during fight scenes. Also, seeing a new side to Heimdall was amazing."
7 February 2018,flechterinhe-39253,2,7,8,Entertaining but not perfect,"Thor: Ragnarok tries to emulate Guardians of the galaxy but I would've prefered the movie to have a more serious tone.Also plots could have been explored a bit more: Hela's past, the women warriors story, Heimdall's resistance, Odin's exile, Asgard's destruction... It's sad that so much material is wasted on only one movie , there's enough to this story to make a whole trilogy.The movie is very entertaining though, so that's a plus."
2 January 2022,jamiemorrison-52687,0,2,7,"Funny and great, but...(spoilers here)","This film was funny as hell. There, I said it.Thor, Hulk, Valkyrie, korg and Grandmaster are comic genius here, bouncing off each other with awesome effect. The reference to Willy Wonka was inspired.The action was well done for sure, but sort of middling for a big action film nowadays, I wouldn't say it was awe inspiring.The villain, Hela, was a bit weak for me. Ok, but not terrifying or anything.My one bug bear here was the far too easy, almost throwaway deaths of Thor's three good friends Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun. These are great characters who were built up well in earlier episodes and just blown away like dust here. Sure, characters die in war, but to just have them die so so easily was just wrong and a little upsetting to be honest. I get that Hela is powerful, but it just really bit and almost spoiled the whole thing for me. Great characters should be treated with more respect.So, overall the film is great fun but almost spoiled by treating the deaths of important characters far too lightly."
23 November 2017,LWSheffield,0,3,8,Great Odin's Raven!,"**contains spoilers** In no way is this a criticism but my immediate review of this movie for anyone who asked was that it was jingling keys for a baby. For a movie titled Ragnarok - essentially the apocalypse - it all feels somewhat inconsequential as soon as you come away from it, however it is a contender for one of the most entertaining MCU offerings. It looks great, its pacing is fast and tidy, there are enough tie-ins to the wider MCU to satisfy and finally there is genuine humour in a Thor movie. I believe this movie will have good re-watch value and is a fine example of what Taika Waititi is capable of with a big budget, alongside his successful and excellent indie portfolio. I can see that some people will struggle with this movie as nearly everything is played for the joke, and almost every time it hits. The 'Loki turning into a snake' story and every Korg section are hilarious, and the only two misses in the movie for me were the 'Des & Troy' line and the Hela fight scene where she slays an entire army which looked a little too much like CGI Neo fighting a thousand agent Smiths. The 'Planet Hulk' section is awesome and gives new depth on this character. The Grandmaster is fun, but slightly overstays his welcome (see post-credit scene) and the ending is a perfect cliff-hanger for those of us counting down the days to Infinity War."
4 November 2017,sarah_mccully,0,6,9,The best Thor movie yet!,"To see my full review, go to: https://wp.me/p1M609-4jgSomehow I have missed the other Thor movies so ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was my first venture into this franchise and it was fun! I took my husband with me to see this film and he has seen the other 2 movies and was able to give me a little background. In this 3rd installment, directed by Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Taika Waititi, Thor (played again by Chris Hemsworth), is imprisoned on the other side of the universe by Surtur and he is without his mighty hammer. He knows he needs to get out quickly, because as Surtur tells him Ragnarok is coming. Ragnarok is the prophecy that claims Asgard is going to fall. Thor is able to break his bonds, reclaim his hammer and fight his way out defeating Surtur. He gets back to Asgard where he learns Loki has sent their father to Earth and has taken over control of Asgard. They go to find their father in order to restore peace through out the realms and discover the retirement home Loki left Odin in was being demolished. This is where Doctor Strange makes his cameo helping them find their father in Norway.In Norway Odin tells Thor and Loki that they have a sister called Hela, who was the first born and is the true heir to the throne. As soon as Odin is dead, she will return from her exile and gain more and more power the longer she is in Asgard. Odin then says his good-byes to Thor and Loki and leaves the world setting into motion the prophecy. The clouds open up and Hela comes in. She is set to oversee her plans returning Asgard to a ruthless and dominating force not only in the 9 realms but beyond. While traveling back to Asgard, she ejects Thor and Loki to other parts of the galaxy where they have to survive a lunatic ""Grandmaster"" played by Jeff Goldblum and where they team up with the Incredible Hulk and Valkyrie, knowing they are working against the clock to save Asgard and the Asgardians.The story line was solid and Cate Blanchett was a very wicked villain and I am not sure there is someone with more love of her job and her power than Hela. Ms. Blanchett plays that perfectly. Her army is every inch of the evil she possesses and the battles are great.The film is chock full of adventure, action, plenty of humor and lots of killing (Hela is the Goddess of Death after all). We were a little surprised by the rating after seeing the film. Some of the humor is sexual in nature but I have a feeling most of that will go right over the heads of kids (just a head's up for parents). That being said, I did not feel like I was missing out on anything at all not having seen the other films and I was able to keep up with the story line. In fact, my husband said that may have been to my advantage. If you haven't seen the other movies, you will do fine seeing this movie as a stand alone. I enjoyed the action and the humor and the story kept the viewer engaged. It was a really good bit of fun.My husband thinks this is the best Thor movie yet. He says it takes a very different turn from the other movies and it really worked. Heads up, there is the usual extra scene during the credits and then a secret scene at the very end, which we found hilarious."
13 December 2017,prathikofficial,0,2,6,Something for your family. Nothing more and nothing less.,"I saw this movie more than a month ago, and I really hope I wasn't the only one who walked out of the hall both, in-splits and dissappointed. As a guy who grew up reading comic-boks, Ragnarok was one of my favourite storylines along with Flashpoint and Civil War. But how does a studio like Marvel combine stories like Planet Hulk and Ragnarok, and still come up with his movie?The movie's color scheme reminded me of GotG, and was rather out of place with the ""Revengers"". Oh, how I hated that joke! There was no forced humor in this movie because of the way that the MCU has been constructed (cue the shawarma scene). But as a plot point, i'm definitely tired of the taking over the universe thing. It works for Thanos and Darkseid, but not Lady Death. She could have a brilliant characters arc, but the writers really lack imagination.My rating for this movie is mainly for the actors, their efforts, and KORG. Now that's what I call a humourous character. There wasn't a single second where he was on screen that I wasn't laughing. On a more serious note, I want to start a petition where all Stan Lee cameos are replaced by this man. However, I'm afraid Thanos kills him at the start of Infinity War. Chris Hemsworth is a naturally funny person, and Mark Ruffalo can nail all aspects of his character. There's nothing we can say about Tom Hiddleston's performance that hasn't been said before. Jeff Goldblum plays a potentially gay brother of Taneleer Tivan, and his character only fails in depth. Cate Blanchett and Karl Urban are the only ones who don't wow us. I most definitely hated the over-dramatic death of Karl Urban's Skurge. All in all, I believe that the entire movie is only passable but definitely something the family can watch and enjoy."
29 March 2018,sdevet-79388,1,2,3,"It's John Carter! No it's Guardians of the Galaxy.. no wait, it's a Thor movie!!","Welcome to my John Carter review.
Our main character lands on an alien planet where he gets captured.
Forced to fight as a gladiator. To meet a beautiful woman and together start an uprising in order to return to their home planet!... oh.. no.. wait.. is this a thor movie?!First off, the movie is enjoyable. However, it failed to hold my attention that well. Mainly because the storyline and ""serious parts"" were outweighed by jokes.. and more jokes.. and forced jokes.. and more jokes..Don't get me wrong, the marvel movies and universe have room for jokes, when it fits the story, or when it fits the character. In this movie, it doesn't feel right. End of the world, end of Asgard.. aaah.. let's make an out of context joke about it! Thor loses his eye in a ""horrible"" battle.. Loki; ""Haha, you lost you eye brother""...
Those aren't jokes that fit the character and aren't always funny because of it.Ironman/tony stark can make jokes in life threatening moments, as he is a sarcastic kind of character. Spiderman has a lot of humour as he is young. Guardians of the Galaxy has a chaotic humour as it's 5 people trying to work together combined with the silliness of Groot.Thor however, was quite a serious character in the previous marvel movies, Thor and avengers. Where the largest part of his humour and jokes came from the fact that he ""doesn't fit in"", that he ""not from earth and doesn't understand some things said"". The seriousness of the last movies was offset by having Loki in the movie with some darker humour that fits the character and the movie.
I was expecting quite a ""dark"" and serious movie like the previous were. Especially as the subject of the movie is how Asgard is in danger and that destruction is near. But... nope.. it's all colourful, happy, jokes, haha, laugh laugh!Bruce Banner is also a very serious character. Same as the Hulk. But in this movie the hulk is like an angry todler, walking, talking, and don't forget to add jokes!!! that also doesn't seem to fit his character.
Especially when he jumps out of a spaceship as bruce banner, to land all cool like the Hulk. Would be an amazing scene in (finally) a quite action packed and exciting moment, the final battle!!! But no.... they have him flop on the ground as Bruce Banner like a rag doll.. the battle stops where everyone goes ""haha, funny, haha, what happened?"" To still have him change into the Hulk and start fighting... completely ruining the pace of the end battle.. I'm hoping for a marvel action packed movie, not some slap stick comedy.Even the start of the movie where Thor is tied up and hanging on a chain. Talking to an evil boss thing that isn't important to the story. He's slowly twisting on that chain and at some point they stop the conversation when he's facing the other way and go ""haha, i'm facing the other way HAHA LAUGH!! aren't we awkward hahah"".. then he spins back and they continue talking while he keeps spinning.. 10 seconds later ""HAHA repeat the joke again!""... It ruins the feel of the movie. 
That scenario would fit Guardians of the Galaxy, it would fit spiderman, it would possibly fit Iron man. It doesn't seem to fit a Thor movie.It simply doesn't feel right and doesn't feel like a Thor movie. It's like someone took the script of the next ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie, scratched out everything that has to do with the Guardians and replaced it with ""Thor"" and ""Hulk"".. 
It's spaceships, alien planet, aliens.. It's Thor meets Guardians of the Galaxy meets John Carter meets Wall-E. And i'm not sure that's a good thing."
18 November 2017,jcramadi,1,4,8,Marvel's most adventurous movie yet.,"THOR RAGNOROK represents the revolution of Thor. It is colorful, action-fueled, comedic, and highly adventurous. Thor in this movie undergoes major character change where he is more dimensional compared to the previous movies. He's funnier, wittier, greater chemistry with the other characters in this movie and even more drive as his goal to save the people of Asgard intensifies. I like how they also revolutionized Bruce/Hulk characters to being more interactive and dynamic with the other characters. Watching these two interact was so refreshing to see especially since they have been shortchanged in the character development department. Thank you MARVEL.Out of all the villains in the MCU so far I find Hela as the most dynamic and unforgettable character. It starts with her incredible action sequences, awesome display of power, and her appearance. Her backstory was intriguing with her relations to Odin. Every time I see her on the screen I just want to see more. Also the fact that she is so powerful that the heroes could not stop her without resurrecting the awesome Surtur!What I wanted this movie to do that it failed to give that apocalyptic tone. Ragnorok is the end of days, the destruction of Asguardian Gods and with all the comedy it seems to forget that there is an Apocalypse. That tone was missed throughout the movie and towards the end all though the comedy is welcomed and worked, it lost that epic sense of the apocalypse. It also wasted Hela in terms of her dynamics with the other characters. She was confined to Asguard so we didn't get to see her interact with Valkyrie (which would have added more weight to the movie because of past confrontation in the flashbacks), with Hulk, or even Loki, and not so much Thor or Heimdall. It would have made her a much more compelling villain as what drove her was her right to claim the Asguardian Kingdom. Hulk was stuck fighting with the wolf instead of fighting the undead legion and Hela (which would have been awesome). Also deleting the fight between Hela and the destroyer as also a missed opportunity. Sometimes i felt that the fights with Hela were very quick and not savored enough for the audience, but maybe that was for the best.The theme of Asguard is not a place its a people was seen throughout the movie and it gave the movie some gravity and focus towards the end.My favorite scenes were the fight between Hela, Thor, Loki in hyperspace, the Gladiator battle, Valkyrie flashback, Hela vs Asguard, Surtur vs Thor, and the Rise of Surtur in the end.Marvel is beginning to brand itself as a superhero-comedy and they are embracing that. Thor 3 isn't overly comedic as GOTG 2 it's rather more balanced and every character brings something to the table so no one is left out in the development department. And it is the most adventurous movie they have made. Marvel is getting better with these movies and I am excited for its future. 8.3/10"
6 December 2017,nicolehenderson-14532,1,2,5,"Right, let's take off our ""Marvel Glasses"" for one second.","I had high hopes for this movie; that may have contributed to my disappointment of it, but nevertheless, I found the film pretty unoriginal and uninspired for the most part. First of all, lets talk about Hela. I adored her design and Cate Blanchett's transformation from the blonde haired beacon to the Gothic leather-bound goddess was quite stupendous. However, what attracted me most about the character was the ""bad- assery"" that came with being the Goddess of Death, where she crushed Thor's hammer with a single hand. So, with expectations for a good time well above the norm, I was ready to see this character fully fleshed out. What did I get? A comedic comic relief character sprinkled with the darker tone and overpowering greatness. It felt like a McDonald's advert, where Hera's advertisements were sinically great, but the actual product is sort of what you wanted, but most definitely not as good as what they said. The substance is there, but not really. I felt like I got cat fished a little. Overall, it wasn't really the character herself that was comedic, but the atmosphere around her which was. This brings me to my next point, Super-Saiyan Thor and his ghost dad: Odin. Oh, I really felt the emotion and heartbreak when Odin died, after having discovered him to not be on the throne all this time as he first thought...Not. Even when Thor got his eye slashed off by Hera, there was not even a wince. Also, with the presence of the Mufasa- like Odin initiating his super-saiyan form, it made the only potentially emotional scenes rather dull in that department. So, all in all, the film was funny. The action hero movie which features the first real death of an influential character in the Marvel Avengers universe, which is just funny. All those that praise this film for it's hilarity as comedy, I will fully support and agree on. However, as anything but that, I would have to disagree. Marvel films are starting to fall into this trap, especially when you compare Thor to Thor: Ragnorok. But, alas I have said too much."

7 December 2017,oscarertman,0,2,5,"This movie is about Thor trying to stop his eldest sister from taking over Asgard.(Just Watch The movie,You'll Understand)","I went to see this movie with a friend of mine,in a theater and in the middle of the movie,I dropped my phone.Throughout the entire movie I tried to pick it up,all while my eyes stayed locked on the screen.This should tell you some things about the movie.It was amazing.It was a nice break from an average superhero movie,with some meta commentary.Just so you know,6 stars(which is what I rated this) is very high for someone like me who detests giving very high or perfect scores.I only have a few criticisms.If the meta humor is what you enjoy,and if you are old enough,you probably should watch Deadpool.Also,It probably would have been more interesting if Thor had left the planet he was trapped on much earlier.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit,and I understood it even though I do not usually follow the Marvel cinematic universe."
1 June 2018,codfather-84460,0,0,8,One of the best MCU flicks from the last year,"Wow, this movie is exactly what Thor needed to stick out from the rest of the heroes from the MCU. It's funny, its action scenes are awesome, it follows the Planet Hulk storyline very well, it doesn't waste any time trying to take a film about a god with the power of thunder seriously and the performances given to us are really well executed. While, not being flawless, it still is one of the best MCU movies in a while.The humour used is really good which genuinely surprised me as humour used in movies like Avengers: Age of Ultron was really unfunny and never once worked at all for me but nearly every scene is so hilarious that I felt like 'This is awesome!' most of the time by the humour alone.The action is so memorable with one of the best examples of bombastic, crazy action being the ending Led Zeppelin 'Immigrant Song' using battle of Asgard which wowed me so much as well as pretty much every action scene.The story Planet Hulk follows the story of Hulk being blasted into a random trash planet and becomes popular among the crowd of a gladiator fighting arena and this is what happens in this film until Thor appears which I believe doesn't happen in the comic book but it's still good nonetheless.I mentioned in the intro that the film doesn't waste any time to make us feel bad for anyone or take it seriously as the previous two Thor movies made it all dark and gritty which threw me off massively but Taika Waititi brings us a innovative new idea of a fun, awesome Marvel movie by bringing in really unique jump cuts that are really inventive and new characters that already seem fully fleshed out like Korg who if you didn't know, is actually played by Taika Waititi and is by far the funniest character with his really funny one liners and moments that really made me laugh out loud.Moving on to major characters, Thor played by Chris Hemsworth is actually phenomenal as not only that he is written superbly by Waititi, he is acted and portrayed as a big-headed idiot which makes his character even more hilarious. Loki (despite dying in the last one) is back and is played by Tom Hiddleston very well which I really enjoyed and is also very funny by being written as a stupid idiot who really doesn't like anyone but himself like Loki is in the comics. Hulk makes his MCU return being played by Mark Ruffalo again and I really enjoyed him in the movie as he is another character that I found funny to a certain extent. Cate Blanchett as the main villain Hela was being criticised which I mainly ignored because she has a good actor behind her and is again, a really funny character which is a really good vibe for a silly, bombastic movie.Moving onto gripes, this movie is sometimes so funny that it kind of overwhelms you which I know, sounds silly as the fact that it is funny becomes a bad thing but people were saying that about The Lego Batman Movie so I can say it about this movie is ok, right? Another problem is that this movie is still based around Asgard which bugs me because the whole idea of Asgard makes me bored as I never found it a good concept from the first Thor movie.Overall, this movie is a great Thor movie which i know, sounds weird considering it's a Thor movie but this movie is still a great movie that makes me excited for a potential fourth Thor movie."
25 January 2022,igpignatova,2,8,9,awesome,"Awesome movie! Taika Waititi has outdone himself. He brought to the third film about Thor something that was not in the previous parts - humor. At times, it looks a little ridiculous and seems like overkill, but oddly enough, it does not spoil the film at all. On the contrary, Thor 3 turned out awesome. Shocking plot. The characters played great. The cool Hulk, the creepy Hela, the brutal Thor, who lost his eye, like his father, Odin, the Valkyrie, who renounced Asgard, drowning her pain with a drink. And Loki! The same trickster, deceiver and merry fellow, but his hero has changed by the end of the film, his egoism has noticeably decreased. Thor sharply settled down and became even more brutal. It is a pity that Asgard could not be saved, and Ragnarok did happen. The final scene on the rainbow bridge is beyond praise, it was very epic. I am glad that the Asgardians managed to be saved by putting them on the ship, and even more glad that the brothers reconcile at the very end of the film. I put 5 out of 5! Time to watch!!"
6 April 2018,bobzilla1996,0,4,10,Probably best Superhero movie to date,"You many think that what I said in the title is exaggerating considering movies such as Dark Knight, The Avengers and Black Panther exist however I can quite easily point out things I don't like or flaws or plot holes in all those movies.I felt watching Thor: Ragnarok, I couldn't find any faults, it was consistently funny, the action scenes were epic and it developed Thor's character perfectly to set it up for Infinity War. Secondly the acting was on point, everyone from Chris Hemsworth to Tessa Thompson to Karl Urban played their role amazingly.Thor before this movie was one of the less liked of The Avengers cast, some didn't like how powerful he was or the fact he acts like a big baby at times. However this movie should solve all those problems for everyone. Although yes in fact he is more powerful now, he has matured and become a true hero.The unique characters are a big bonus to this film, such as the stoneman that is Korg or Miek the insect with swords for hands. They were such good additions to the film and the director did a perfect job with basically everything. This is easily in my top ten movies of all time and by far my favourite and most enjoyable superhero film to date. (Infinity War may top it but who knows)"
17 June 2018,andreaf-78503,1,8,10,Best Thor movie BY FAR!,"This movie was absolutely OUTSTANDING! I absolutely loved it. With Thor: The Dark World before it, that movie being ok, I thought that this one would go on the same path. That's when I saw the trailers. They changed my opinion in an instant. I love that they made a female antagonist. I'm pretty sure that Hela was the first female villain in the MCU. I loved her look, her power, I just loved everything! The comedy was funny, but not too funny. For example, Hulk of course was funny, I liked the joke about the wormhole a.k.a The Devil's Anus, and of course KORG! KORG WAS AWESOME! I liked that they chose the Immigrant Song for like the main song. Jeff Goldblum was awesome as usual. Loki, dramatic as ever. I was sad to say goodbye to Odin though. I ADORED Valkyrie. I loved her story of how she had lost everything the first time she met Hela. (Don't hate me, but I think Valkyrie and Loki would be a good couple. Hehe). I liked the fact the Taiki Watiti was directing and acting during the movie, I thought that was talented. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I think this is my favorite MCU movie. Well done Taiki, well done."
24 January 2018,chamodkushan,0,5,10,OMG!!! The real God of thunder,"Woow...it's amazing and a huge cinematic work.it's beautiful actually.when the Thor got the Blue lightning on his body,and it was the best scene in the movie.wow great work marvel.well directed and performed by every actors.Hulk and the Thor was a brilliant pair.and they made me so laugh at the moments.
 and as usually marvel has left the hype again....and I can't wait.....let's count the days to Blck Panther and the huge cinematic war the Infinity War.....love u marvel"
6 December 2017,calebpeli,1,2,7,I am convinced that I would rather cut off my own leg and eat it with some faba beans than spend another second in Asgard.,"Gosh, I hate that stupid shiny pipe organ. Anyhow, the comedy is the best part of this film. It l is the funniest Marvel film. Lots of great gags if you ask me. The other thing I thought they did pretty well was the Hulk. A lot more Hulk than we have ever seen in a long time. The story, however, is very lacking. I would have cut out the whole part on earth. The Doctor Strange cameo was super tacked on and unasked for. Didn't need that and what they do with Odin makes no sense. The third act is a CGI crap fest and very dumb. Screw Asgard! This movie as also another great example of Marvel completely wasting Idris Elda's time. I thought the second act of the film on the garbage Jeff Goldblum planet was the best. It was a lot more like Guardians of the Galaxy and it kinda worked. The problem is when they left and went back to the very Thorish land of Asgard that it lost my interest again. The characters are lacking for the most part. Cate Blanchett hasn't been this bad since Crystal Skull and her character has about as much depth as a piece of tinfoil. She enjoys walking around giving unwanted Asgardian history lessons and throwing spikes at people. Joining her is Karl Urban's character, who is the most uninspired evil sidekick since the other two coyotes from The Lion King (Whoopi was great). His ark is legitimately more predictable than the earth's rotation. We get a new hero in Tessa Thompson who's I thought was called Valkyrie until they said that she was a Valkyrie so I looked at the credits and it said her name is Valkyrie so I am really confused. Anyway, her ark goes from unhelpful, self-centered slave trader to heroically saving everybody for no reason. Returning in a desperate effort to be relevant is Thor's forgettable Asgard squad – minus the lady one. No idea where she is. Anyway, they die in like fifteen seconds, which is probably the same amount of time they took to write them in the first place. Last but not least is Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum so no complaints there. In the end, I really just wish that Taika Waititi had written this film as well as directed it. Taika Waititi's last three films are hilarious, have great characters and have emotionally relevant stories. This movie lacks a lot of what makes Taika Waititi's films so great. I feel like all we really get is his humor."
22 January 2018,Yomanew,0,3,8,"Waste of time, some say!","This wasn't a COMPLETE waste of time, I'd say.At least they got the story moving, ahead, to the Infinity Wars movie that's coming out soon.And if Thor misses an eye in that movie, you know why and when he lost it. If loki is not as bad as he was in the previous movies, you know THAT, too, why he isn't anymore, and why he's fighting with all those Avengers, if he is.You also know, kinda, why Hulk is in control of Banner, kinda.Yeah, you also know, after watching this movie, what that spaceship was, when the movie ended and Thor and Loki looked up! ;)So yeah, I'd have given it 10/10, if this movie had done more than just clearing these points I just mentioned.It was worth watching, THAT, I'd say for sure.Go ahead and give it a shot, and you'll Loki and Thor more, than you had before.8/10, from me."
4 November 2017,kaneerj,0,10,9,really entertaining movie,"this movie was nearly perfect, we all know it is really good with good fight scenes and good jokes so ill point out some of the things did made it a 9 instead of a 10, I think the wolf caused more terror before dying as he didn't even kill 1 person the whole movie and the wolf and hulk fight was way to short and ended very effortlessly with the wolf just falling off the waterfall, I think it should have been more intense and they could have had the hulk kill him in a much more gruesome legit way like ripping his jaw off or something, the ending fight with hella was pretty good but could have been a lot better, they could have had hulk and thor and loki team up to push or throw hela into the sword strike of the giant demon surtur to show a much more sure gruesome death rather then a supposed death of hela where the big surtur did pretty much all the work besides needing loki and thor to bring him back to life. but overall no movie can be perfect and this movie was close enough."
26 November 2017,stertheo,0,2,7,I thought I watched an animated Thor and not a movie,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. It was fun and had lots of action. I had an entertaining 2+ hours. But saying that, the way the movie was done it looked like an animated movie with real actors in it. When you want to watch a superhero movie and not a cartoon, at least you want it to be more realistic and not cartoonish. The Avengers were made better, it looked more real, than Thor: Ragnarok."
15 October 2018,addykay-60788,2,5,10,I loved this movie,"Thor Ragnarok was produced in 2017, the producer is Kevin Feige. Some of the main character and cast is Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk), and Cate Blanchett (Hela). This film had quite a few nominees, but I will only name off a few such as the Saturn award for being best comic to action motion picture, best supporting actress being Tessa Thompson, and Critics Choice award for Chris Hemsworth being the best actor in a comedy. My opinion of this movie was that it was a great action and comedy film. This film setting takes place in space if were looking at the big picture. Thor and his friends go between many different planets in the galaxy in this film. This film is about Thor, his friends, and people he meets along the way coming together to save Asgard but they find out that it isn't necessarily Asgard itself that needs saving. This movie was the perfect balance of action and humor down to Thor and his friends adventure in the grandmaster ship and each individual character's personality in the film. This film works well because it keeps you smiling and on the edge of your seat ready to see what's coming next. I would most definitely rate this movie a 10 out of 10. This movie is about Thor and his friends going on an adventure to save Asgard. He meets some friends along the way and they all come together and try to save Asgard from the Chaotic Hela. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what's going to come next. Thor is a humorous and action-packed movie with all its unique and interesting characters and their relationships with each other. Thor and his friends realize a more important message at the end of the story. This movie puts emphasis on family and friends while keeping things funny and entertaining. Certain characters in this film really make the movie. The Grand Masters character plays as an arrogant, egotistical ruler of the planet they are on. An example I like from Thor: Ragnarok from the Grand Master is when he's talking to Loki and he says ""You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution. But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little ""who's gonna get him first?"" So, you're on the clock!"". I think that gives everyone a pretty good idea of his wild personality. Another character I found hilarious was Korg, he was by far one of my favorites in the movie with his matter-of-fact and blunt personality. The example I'll give for him is when Thor is asking him if anyone has fought the Grand Masters champion and he replies with ""Yeah. Doug has. Hey, Doug. Could you come over here? Oh, yeah, I forgot, Doug's dead. Anyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perished. You're not actually thinking about fighting him, are you?"". Korg was one of my favorite Characters in the movie. Valkyrie is another one of the characters that really makes the movie, with her prevalent alcoholism and raw personality. I really believe the characters in this movie are hysterical. Other moments in Thor I really liked was Lokis play at the beginning. Loki has actors and he is having them reenact the scene between him and Thor from a previous avenger movie. The humor in this movie is goofy but its fit for the movie. Another moment is when Skurge is showing the girls his shake weights he found on earth with all the other deadly weapons. One scene between Loki and Thor which they call the ""get help"" plan is also a funny one. Thor and Loki pretend Loki is hurt and yell get help to cause a distraction. The fight between Hulk and Thor is also pure entertainment, I liked it because it was funny and its cool to see them in another movie together but not working together. Thor is supposed to be fighting the grand masters champion little does he know it is the hulk and he thinks hulk recognizes him and they won't fight but Hulk end up beating him up anyway and it throws Thor off. Thor still ends up winning the fight because he knows the hulks weakness and he beats him. Another moment I like is when Thor is meeting with Dr. Strange and he keeps using his magic on Thor so he is confused. The song they use at the beginning and end is also something I liked. It really sets the mood for the action. One of the more inappropriate scenes is when Thor is escaping the Grand Masters planet and they steal his ship. Thor is being chased and he's trying to find the button to shoot back and asks Valkyrie and she says the grand-master only used it for his parties and orgies. I also liked one of the ending scenes when angry hulk is trying to beat up the monster in Asgard and Thor says, ""For once hulk, don't smash"". I just loved all the funny scenes in the movie. There was pretty much nothing I didn't like. I would love it if my review made all of you guys reading it want to watch the movie. It is truly a great movie. Watch the movie and enjoy the silly humor that is contains. Take away the message it gives at the end. Even though it is just an action movie it does have a message at the end. If you love the Marvel movies this movie is for you. This was one of the best Marvel movies yet. I would give this movie 5 stars."
30 November 2017,swethav-534-563522,0,3,7,"The best Thor movie so far, but not without pitfalls","The movie has all the elements of a blockbuster - great action scenes, humor, stunning visual effects, a decent story and talented actors. The difference from the previous 2 Thor movies is that this one has a lot of humor and the story moves away from the well-known versions of Thor and Hulk. You get to see a different character in both of them. The letdowns were all the Hela scenes. Cate Blanchett is an amazing actor however she is not convincing as the menacing Goddess of Death. Also, her background information was bleak - where she was all these years and how she escaped were dealt with just a few words. Thor without the hammer and long locks adds a refreshing spin on the character depiction."
11 November 2017,fishrobertson,0,11,9,One of the best marvel films to date,"Thor Ragnarok is the perfect blend of comedy, action, development and surprise. The only way I can describe this film is by starting at the beginning, with my favourite marvel fight scene to date which blends perfect filmography and cinematography with outstanding fight choreography and graphics. Watching Thor's hammer's perspective in a fight scene whilst he is battling it out with his sheer brute strength is amazing and proves that the hammer and himself are a team not just an weapon and a hero. The loss of Thor's trademark items like his hair, Kingdom, hammer and eye is necessary to make a surprising and incredible ending to the film. The music in this fight scenes is nothing short of inspiring and impactful whilst leaving a smile on your face at the end. My favourite part about this fight scene is the fact that you secretly know that this might be the last fight scene we have with mjolnir in the marvel cinematic universe and knowing that is 100% amazing. As you can see there are very few things about this film that I don't like but there were a few things I wasn't too fond of, like perhaps the overuse of rushed scenes, the only scene I have in mind here is (SPOILER AHEAD) Anthony Hopkins's (Odin) deaths scene as there wasn't as much emotional impact is should have had and it rushed the explanation and introduction of the supremely powerful main antagonist, Hela. However aside from that one scene I loved everyone's portrayal of their character, especially Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of the grand-master as a secondary villain and Chris Hemsworth's best portrayal of Thor to date. To some up this movie I shall reuse my summary BY FAR One of the best marvel films to date."
4 November 2017,habitaciondeduvi,0,3,8,Too much comedy,"I must admit that Thor is not my favorite superhero of the Universe Marvel, but the trailer has called me too much attention as to miss the opportunity to see the movie.The only thing that has not excited me about the movie is the amount of jokes or easy situations that have included in the movie so that be more comical. There are frankly good situations, as it happens in the case of the Grand Master that is clearly a created character specifically to give a touch of humor, but there are others in which he looks too forced.The best thing about the movie is, without a doubt, the fight between Hulk and Thor maintains a very good rhythm, does not lengthen too much in time nor is it too short. One of the best battles that have been seen.The character of Helda (Cate Blanchett) had seemed fabulous, a great villain who has nothing to envy to the rest of this universe, I would even dare to say that it is one of the best I've seen, but I think they could have taken advantage of their story a lot more. That yes, the final struggle with her has been insufficient, I would have liked to have seen a little more of his powers and what he can get to be able.Another aspect that I did not like especially, has been Asgard, which I imagined would be much more imposing and grandiose, but it has stayed in a fairly normal place for what I expected."

10 November 2017,dptazzz,0,6,9,"OK, its sooooo close to an 11, but misses due to one character.","OK. really wanted to give this a 10, even before I saw it, because I love the other 2 movies that much.But.... I fully expected the Grandmaster to not come off as a whiny, wimpy, weasel with no real power other than what he must of gotten by hook or crook.. I mean, he is OK,, and I like Jeff G., but how they have him in the movie, i mean, come on, he sounds like he is one moment, kinda nice guy with way to much power, or is he a vindictive asshole you don't ever dare even make upset, and lose his favorite "" toy"".?? I truly expected a bit more "" terrifying"" and a lot less "" Big Bang Theory Sheldon"" character..Other than that, the rest of the movie pretty much shines. Quite a bit more comedy in this one than any others, or all others combined. Thor comes off a lot more light-hearted,,, a tad "" egotistical"", but, it works in the characters favor.The premise works, the ending works, a lot of things tie together in positive ways.. So really, for me, the only issue that sort of dragged down the movie, was how they portrayed, or had Jeff G portray, the Grandmaster... change that up, and this movie is an 11 out of 10.."
25 November 2017,kpruss3,0,5,9,Fun and amazing! Loved every minute!,This movie was so much better then Dark World! Natalie Portman and Kat Dennings were not missed! Loved all the new characters! Korg was so funny! Valkyrie was a great addition to the team! And really wasn't too much of a love interest to Thor! Cate Blanchett did a great job playing Hela without overdoing it or being too over dramatic. You can't have a Thor movie without Loki. Him and Thor have great chemistry together. I thought that the comedy was great! A lot of people think it was too forced and should have more comic like. I honestly think the movie would have been more boring without the comedy. Hulk was great! And it was nice to see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce banner again. Loved the doctor strange cameo too! Overall it was a great movie and is definitely in my top 5 in the marvel movies category!
12 November 2017,kshitijpaliwal,0,5,7,Typical Marvel movie but with a antagonist of a very high standard,"It's quite evident to me after watching this movie that Marvel avoids exploring dark sides of their characters and stories as much as possible(with the exception of civil war) which looks unconvincing at many times.You won't see Thor worried for 95 percentage of the movie and yet the movie touches some very desperate situations including destruction of Asgard and losing his father. Thor is not depressed, angry, sad or even a tad bit vulnerable but they explore his lighter side and the equation with other cast members basically all the fun and cool looking stuff to look at, no wonder Taika has given a better and fresh take to Thor which is entertaining in most of the parts just that it is unconvincing.I loved each and every character which appeared on screen and their fresh treatment special mention to Hulk.In newer additions Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was BADASS simply awesome and looked very sexy. I kind of liked Thor's equation with Jane and was skeptical about how his future relationships will be handled but it's far better than his earlier equation with Jane. Jeff Goldblum was extremely funny, very likable. The one thing this Marvel movie has added to it's formulaic treatment of movie making is addition of what I could say the best Marvel villain since Loki and Baron Zemo. I think Cate Blanchett as Hela was splendid and she elevated this movie from just another Marvel mess to an enjoyable saga. She looked and played the part to the perfect T. She made Hela very interesting and attractive.The best part was the action sequences Hands down.Mesmerizing, racy, thrilling, beautiful looking and exciting.Again a double thumbs up there👍👍.Just some pacing issues it kind of drags in parts and a bit unconvincing approach to the story but a good new take on the characters and screenplay.Overall a fun watch enjoy and have a good time"
30 December 2018,camerondavidson-40749,2,8,1,The movie is fun but Hela's character is such a disappointment,"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so and thought it was a great start (minus some of the utterly eye-rolling attempts at humor), but for me it all sort of came to a screeching halt once Odin died and it was revealed that Hela was Thor's sister.It was just a terrible writing decision for the character and made her look like nothing more than a second-rate Loki clone. It pretty much destroyed the entire movie for me because I was really hoping this character would be another good villain like Vulture, but alas she is probably one of the worst to date. Visually her costume design was perfect, she was surprisingly hot to look at, and Cate Blanchett played her well enough (it was far from her best performance mind you), but the character writing itself was horribly lazy and unoriginal. She was just a completely one-note and stupidly overpowered character who was evil for the sole purpose of being evil and was angry at people who punished her for being evil. And every scene between her and Thor felt incredibly awkward and forced because the two had no established relationship with one another and no real reason to hate each other (unlike Loki who already had more development in the first half of the first Thor movie than Hela did throughout the entire course of this film). Her not looking anything like Thor or Odin in appearance didn't do her any favors either. She had practically no interaction with any of the main protagonist characters aside from talking to Thor for maybe 5 minutes at the most throughout the entire movie. Most of her screen time was wasted on Skurge (another lame villain who I'll talk about later). And the big, ugly, rotten cherry on top of all of this is that she practically had no real plan once she got Asgard, so her threat didn't feel genuine to me. The only reason there was a conflict at all during the final battle is because she was too focused on making her grand introduction to take the Bifrost Sword upon arriving in Asgard as to avoid it being stolen by Heimdall. I guess her plan was to destroy the other eight realms while rambling about her ego?I know it's a fantasy film, but whoever wrote this seriously expects the audience to believe that Hela was just born looking the way she did with the set of powers that she had; powers that no other Asgardian possessed and an appearance that looked like she should have been related to Loki instead of Thor? Sorry, I just don't support stuff like this. As a big fan of Cate Blanchett it's depressing that she was wasted like this and I don't think the character writing deserved her in the role or her perfect costume design at all.The good news, however, is that if you are not like me and didn't expect or want much out of Hela then you will probably love this film. The main Thor vs. Hulk fight was great and I actually rather enjoyed the banter between the two on Sakaar. Thor's character arc here was a massive improvement over The Dark World, but I still prefer his arc from the first Thor movie just due to my bias preference for that film. Valkyrie was also a decent and welcome character, but they could have done more with her IMO. Loki was still on point but I wish we had seen him interact with Doctor Strange more; that cameo from Cumberbatch was great. However, once they got to Asgard for the final battle it all fell apart for me again because there was no real weight to it; partly due to Hela's terrible character writing and partly due to the nonstop humor which just didn't work during a serious battle.Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban were also completely wasted on lame one-note side characters who didn't do anything particularly memorable throughout the entire film... well in all fairness Skurge had a cool final battle scene, but that's about it.Overall this film could have been way better had the main villain's character writing been at least passable (it was considerably below average IMO) and had the final battle just been more serious. But taking all of my issues into consideration, it sits at the very bottom of the barrel for me when it comes to the MCU - and I have not once walked out of a single MCU movie outright hating it prior to the night I saw Ragnarok.7/10 without Hela's horrible writing and the disappointing final battle, 1/10 with everything included."
12 November 2017,mkravec-07821,1,9,9,Best action movie 2017,"RagnaROCKY!!!!!! Thor and the Hulk destroy just about everything but each other--I think that infers that they are both gods of some kind. Like the original ROCKY movie, both are heroes worthy of Asgard. THE action movie of the year with plenty of humour. Watch it and see if Asgard gets destroyed.Pretty good with Dbox 4D at a jaw dropping $25.00 in Toronto."

4 November 2017,flashwaynearrow,0,8,9,"Must watch, immediately!","This is, by far, the best movie to be churned out of the MCU, even taking legendary stuff like Iron Man (2008) into consideration. The movie opens with a hilarious Thor dangling around in some hell-world, with Surtur spewing Ragnarok in his face while he keeps rotating. This is followed by our beloved Mjolnir helping him break out of chains, and an incredible use of the 'Immigrant Song' taking place. Some time later, you find Thor and Loki on Earth, looking for Odin, when Doctor Strange comes into play (great job Benedict Cumberbatch!) and just confuses the **** out of Thor. Hilarious! We see a sad old Odin right after, telling Thor and Loki about Hela. Within 30 minutes of run-time, we know who Hela is and what she looks like and what she can do. Now here comes the boring part. Aside from the big fight anticipated in the trailer, great one-liners, and occasional scenery changes to see what's happening on Asgard, the whole Sakaar bit is quite boring. I feel that the Grandmaster has been over-hyped and exaggerated. I was disappointed. After bearing through the whole sequence and into the Devil's Anus, we finally end back up on Asgard, and the final battle is ready to begin between all of our heroes. I will not say anything about this sequence, as no words in my mind can describe the masterpiece I saw. At the end, I see nothing but awesomeness when I think about Thor: Ragnarok in my head. Hopefully this review is able to justify my views and the general consensus."
28 October 2017,anokhavirus,3,14,7,Movies9.us,"Thor 3 Ragnarok Full Movie Only On http://movies9.us/watch/thor-3-ragnarok-full-movie-2017The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three Thor movies. Firstly because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard MARVEL fan I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his role in Ragnarok and there are some HUGE details that'll lead to Infinity War and you'll lose your mind when you see them."
17 November 2017,michoncarlos,1,9,10,The Best Marvel Movie so far...,"THis movie was simply amazing. Very we'll made, good acting, and good comedy. The funny parts were hilarious. It's starts with a good plot with Thor (Chris) and Loki (Tom) loosing their father and meeting their evil older sister, who's his much stronger than both of them, and strangely, can also hold, and destroy mjolnir. After Thor gets lost in the universe, he meets Hulk, a woman warrior and a very funny rock made alien. This is the funniest character of the movie. Actions sequences are very good, and we also see a glimpse of Doctor Strange."
4 September 2019,jasonchristopherbecker,0,1,4,Definitely a Laugh...,"The Thor franchise has been bad since 2011, and Ragnarok did nothing to change that.As is often the case with poor superhero movies, the villain was simply not compelling. Hela has some serious daddy issues, which is fair since he imprisoned her for years because she was too good at her job. But because her father imprisoned her, she now hates all Asgardians? She kills hundreds of them just because she can. She has no real motivation.She's also called the goddess of death, but she really just wields hundreds of pointy rocks. Hela should really be called the goddess of stalagmites/stalactites.As for her sidekick, Skurge, it's abundantly clear that he's only in the film as a plot point, as he's given no character, few lines, and an overly obvious aversion to Hela's actions from the beginning, which leads even a slightly intuitive observer to assume he will change sides near the end of the movie.Though this movie is revered as a fantastic comedy, it required an overhaul of Thor's character in order to given him such a sense of humor. In the first Thor movie, he was humorous through misunderstandings of human interactions, such as the smashing of a mug in a diner when he was finished with it. In Ragnarok, however, Thor is making quips that sound like they should be coming out of Tony Stark's mouth; he's sarcastic and witty in a way that the Asgardian brute shouldn't be.I won't deny I had a couple laughs at this movie, but overall, it just isn't worth it."
17 June 2018,drk_soul,1,4,1,Overrated movie beyond imagination,"Thor sense of humor is like a boy trying so hard to make a girl notice him,
Hulk totally lost the presence of the dark side, he is a joke in this movie or more like a little child..To sum it up this movie is just to tell you that Thor hammer is not his source of power *Only a tool to make him can focus his powers* and thus upgrading Thor combat style because he is getting boring!?"
22 February 2018,nhagiaubungbu2507,0,3,6,It's an OK movie,"Honestly, the movie is OK. But I feel this movie is kinda comedy movie for kids, with jokes and jokes and jokes. Like a movie version of an animated movie, not a movie movie. Comparing to all the previous MCU, this movie is a joke. Just have big stars, bad jokes and lot of pointless action and effects, and that's it.Thor character in the 2 previous movies are killed. Now it's a fun cool boy Thor, just to fit in the Marvel fun cool Universe.
Loki could do lots of things: teleport, create illusions, make clones of himself, hide from Heimdall's vision, manipulate Odin ... and yet he is kinda use none of his power to help them get out of trouble.
Not convincing to me how Thor can have the Thunder power, just by imagining Odin and that's it, he becomes the Thunder god."
4 August 2018,lad327,0,2,7,Funny but over the top,"I agree there was a bit too much comedy. Also, Thor didn't even give a second thought to his warrior friends who died so quickly in the movie."

3 May 2018,ula-lecnik,0,0,9,Awesome movie!,"This is my favourite up to date Marvel movie. It's funny, it's interesting and it brings new characters that fit perfectly. I love how Thor has great sense of humor that adds up perfectly to the dark story and just puts on a positive vibe. I loved the new Thor with short hair, one eye and no hammer which means thunder all over. Also the Led Zeppelin soundtrack fits. We should see more hero movies like this one."
27 January 2018,myfransson,1,7,8,AWESOME!!!,"Such a big move up from the other Thor movies. I've enjoyed all of them but this one is one of my favorite Marvel movies! Great acting and extremely funny. The one thing that kept me from giving it a 10 was that it was not emotional enough when Odin passed, Thor's best friends where killed or when Asgaard was destroyed. If there would have been more emotions at those parts it would have been a perfect movie. However still an amazing one. With out a doubt worth watching!!"
2 December 2017,cloudyski-664-545777,0,5,9,Best THOR movie ever,"This movie was fantastic. It was a lot better than the trailer made it look like it was going to be. FINALLY, there is a movie whose trailer doesn't give away too much. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. It was one that knew not to take itself too seriously, YET at the same time still had EXCELLENT acting. That's a really fine line. I thought the casting was PERFECT.The story line was believable and moving. I cared for all of the characters and could understand the choices they made. The motivations they had were very clear. I felt a lot even for the evil characters. They turned out to have more depth than on the surface.The writing has gotten stronger than in previous Thor movies. Also, at the same time, there was great continuity. The movie tied together threads from the previous films. It addressed discrepancies, such as why Thor and Natalie Portman's character were no longer together. It also had really good comedic timing for the characters. They all were funny and didn't overplay their hand.This movie is great for the Marvel Universe because it builds on the existing story lines. It adds to the lore. It brings back characters you liked from before, such as Loki and The Hulk. It introduces funny new side kicks and interesting potential love interests.The graphics are also beautiful. It was very realistic looking and had gorgeous colors! I thought these paintings looked like Da Vincis painted by Italian masters!"
25 January 2020,alexandrumrz,2,9,4,More of a poor comedy rather then an actual film,"From a historic stand point at least Surtr had the right purpose, to burn Asgard to ash come ragnarok. and now come the problems.
Hela was actually named Hel and had a half alive half dead appereance and was actually Loki's daughter
Thor was destined to battle the Midgard serpent (also knows as Jormungandr, also Loki's child)
Fenrir was also a child of Loki, destined to kill Odin
Loki and Thor are NOT brothers although they are both part giant
Ok, you made the 9 norse realms planets, let's say it's okay, where's Yggdrasil?, where are the other realms? presumably, the movie begins in Musplheim, and continues in Asgard and that weird planet where he found Hulk... all the realms are supposed to burn, if you make a movie, especially with this high of a budget named ""Ragnarok"" at least take the folklore for good, the actual description of Ragnarok is way more intense, interesting amazing then this joke of a movie will ever be, why just ragnarok? start from Ginnungagap and Ymir, how Odin became ""the allfather"", come on.... you can make an awesome movie out of this story.
Besides all of this, starting ragnarok shlould've destroyed Earth, known as Midgard in the mythology.Overall i'm kinda dissapointed, it's neither comedy, nor action, somewhere in between those 2 with none of the mentioned generes pictured properly; it wasn't necessary to tie this specific movie to the Marvel universe, it could've been amazing if it were to be done right."
4 January 2018,Poolverine,0,5,10,TOP TOP TOP!,"One of the funniest Marvel movies ever made! I laughed so hard, storyline is great, characters are great, music is great, talking Hulk is great :D and mainly Korg :D I really like the way it's going.... Damn i wish Black Panther to be as perfect as this damn good movie. I saw the movie two months ago, but i decided write a review later. So then today four days after new year lmao. But after-credits black order scene? wow it was good.. poor Asgard citizens who will die by Black Order and Loki, Thor, Valkyrie will be blown away to the infinity universe. BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR CUTE KORG?I really can't wait for Black Panther movie, but daaaamn the longest waiting was for Infinity war... i will be there.. in the cinema... wait for that damn marvel logo.. and watch that damn ""i hope"" the best marvel movie ever. im excited to it since then Marvel confirmed that there will be too many characters.. but not too many... cuz i am really sorry that there won't be fantastic four , dadpool or other x mens,,, let's hope they will be in the new avengers that will be after avengers 2019... these avengers will be with fantastic4, x men, and other avengers that didn't die in previously avengers..

21 November 2017,ashsaysno-41032,1,6,9,Techno Color and Chrome filled Guitar Rifts,"Thor: Ragnarok came out of its corner swinging. The techno color vibes and nostalgic rock n' roll music gave it the tone and visuals it needed. Some would say that the rock n' roll is getting over done in movies but I felt that it was very fitting. Look at the other Thor movies, of all the marvel IPs Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy are probably the most far-fetched or other worldly. The music kind of makes them seem familiar in away, instead of strange and completely ""out of this world"". Maybe this coupled with the more laid back feel of the movie let it succeed where the other Thor movies didn't. Jeff Goldblum really shines in this movie with his eccentric personality as the Grandmaster. Chris Hemsworth is still getting it right every time he plays Thor, albeit the hair cut really does look a lot better. I don't know about anyone else but I defiantly could have used more Korg. This movie is defiantly worth seeing in theaters. It's easily made it into my top 5 Marvel Movies."
19 October 2018,tijnkroon,1,5,7,Well done Marvel studios,"Revieuw about the movie Thor Ragnarok:The set was good. Chris Hamsworth is a good actor in this movie. This movie takes places in Asgard at the present time. I guess this is a comedy movie or something because its also an action movie.Thor and Loki know that they had a sister called Hela. They also heared from Odin that he is quitting. But Hela arrives at Thor and Loki and she breakes his hamer. And they are dropped in another planet. Thor has to fight for is freedom. On that planet he sees Hulk. First he has to fight against Hulk. But on the end the become friends and they are trying to conquer Asgard back.I really loved the film. Esspecially because of the song. The song is ''Immigrant song'' from Led Zappelin III. The photography is very good because it looks so real.
I think that the quality isn't that good as you expect but Marvel made a nice movie. Also please don't judge me on my English because this is for an English lesson."

The gladiator scene is the equivalent of the airport fight scene from Civil War. If Waititi didn't step in to direct this movie it would have been as sad as Thor the Dark World. The music is OK, defiantly does not top Guardians of the Galaxy, but the comedy in this movie tops any marvel movie yet."
3 November 2017,MicahLovesMovies,0,7,8,Great Movie with a Couple of Flaws,"SPOILER ALERT!I loved this movie, don't get me wrong, but there were a few scenes that were either poorly shot, edited, or acted. Like the part where Thor, Loki, and Odin were on the cliff side. The Green screen in that was very badly shown. Or the part where Executioner dies, It was way to cheesy. I did like all the jokes in this movie though. It was a very funny movie to go see, It was kind of an action/comedy. I would recommend this movie to any of my friends. But ya, This movie gets a solid 8/10 from me"

A lot of Easter eggs n something full of humor.. n the music was awesome during fight scenes. visuals are perfectly managed to really amazing worldEven after 3 weeks,i love to watch it again"
14 October 2018,xxx_zandercage_xxx,1,5,10,Waititi is a genius,Anyone who tries to say this movie was trash obviously doesn't know what it takes to reinvent a franchise. Thor showed a whole new side of himself with a funny yet still serious story that truly felt like a comic book movie. The honors that they gave to Jack Kirby in all the colorful designs throughout the film were awesome. It had a lot of humor but it was well placed and it still had its serious moments and even through the humor you could feel the epic stakes that the heroes were up against. Working in Plabet Hulk into the film was great because we finally got to see a fleshed our character arc for the Hulk specifically and not just Banner. I was very happy with everything in this movie and have nothing to complain about whatsoever. My wife isn't in to Marvel movies very much and this actually got her in to watching a few of them because this movie had the ability to draw in new fans who weren't previously fans of the genre. I'm very excited to see the conclusion of the story arc for Hulk that started in this and will conclude in Avengers 4. Thoroughly enjoyable film worth every penny.
3 November 2017,ahmed-elbatt,1,5,8,"Funny, entertaining, the best Thor movie but still lacks a lot.","The movie is by far one of the most entertaining MCU movies. I loved every scene but it didn't add much to the franchise. First of all I loved how funny that movie was even compared it to Deadpool (one of my personal favorites); however, the movie kinda forced me not to care about important characters. I mean, Odin, the father of both Loki and Thor, just died and they keep on joking. Even in Thor: The Dark World, when the mother died they payed her tribute but I did not care at all about Odin nor Asgard as the characters themselves did not seem to care. Also, do not get me started on Hulk as the perfectly ruined The Planet Hulk story-line. I still loved the movie as a standalone but again it lacks a lot."
4 November 2017,mailme_zahid,1,4,7,A comic disappointment,"Thor : The Ragnarok is a laugh riot, a great flick, but to me it couldn't get to the expectations they had set through those multiple trailers.Thor has always been a character without much humour, he keep things royal and intense. This movie is portraying a whole new Thor. He make jokes, he gets laughed at badly by almost everyone, he gets beaten to the ground and what not.On the other hand, there's this negative character Hella. Through the trailers, I have been made to believe that she's gonna be one hell of a bad-ass villain with a large army to fight for her. Nothing much in the movie. The trailers were not just all of her best scenes but mostly the only scenes she has in the movie that matters. First half is total humour, without interruption.And for good, we get to see a new side of Hulk too.Overall, a fun movie, and the mid credits scene is something not to miss."

Humour, action sequences, comebacks, witty one-liners, a HULK who actually makes conversation (other than smashing), Loki getting a taste of Dr Strange, Thor vs Hulk, an awesome background score (Courtesy: Led Zeppelin - The Immigrant Song), ""Revengers"", and finally, Thor unlocking his powers to be the true God of Thunder!!

5 November 2017,mefasu,0,9,10,YES!!! It is the best Thor movie,"I don't know what exactly people are expecting from a movie. Especially one made based on Comic Books. You can not make a life size drama out of everything. You can try but then you end up with something like SupVBat. It was a good movie too but the plot point was extremely weak for something that was trying to be so serious. This movie does not have a suck weak excuses for the villain to fight against the heroes. Nor heroes do stupid stuff while fighting. Yes, they make fun of Surtur and some of the characters but they are there for that reason in anyways. I read many Comics and I did so to have fun and see what incredible things the writers and the artists designed for the customers. If I wanted to learn real stuff, I would have read history books (which I also do but enjoy for completely different reasons). The movie was full of easter eggs, references and fun stuff. It did not get boring while explaining what is going on. You never loose track of who is fighting with who and for what reason. I got bored during many Marvel movies before. I am not a fan of MCU or DC, but a casual comic book and movie fan. Go watch it. And then you may want to watch it again to catch some of the references you may have missed in the first run."
30 November 2017,btmbtm-45269,0,6,10,Thor Ragnarok follows the story of Thor and other heroes who fight against The Goddess of Death.,"In a short summary Thor kills some sort of fire demon creature, and returns to Asgard. He goes to earth to find his father, his father dies causing The Goddess of Death to be free from her imprisonment. A big event is when she breaks his hammer! Through the rest of the story Thor and his new team of ""Revengers"" go to Asgard to fight The Goddess of Death.Over all, I LOVED the movie. The opening scene was really cool and funny. I really loved the timings of the background music in certain scenes and all the different camera angles. You could see that the film crew had a good balance and mixture of Close up shots, mid-ranged shots, and far away shots. I have to say I loved the Hulk vs Thor fight scene the best. The music, the action, the camera angles, and how the pace of the fight was just perfect. You could easily watch it and see clearly what's happening. I find problems like that in some movies, they usually don't bother me, but some times my mom, or dad will have problems with the pace of the fights. One reason my dad doesn't watch Transformers is due to the fast paced fight scenes. There are plenty examples of movies that do this, but I'm going to move on. Another awesome thing I really liked about the movie was the balance between character development and the action scenes. It was like after every action scene portion of the movie, you'd get to know and love the characters even more than you already did. A good example of this was when you learn how Hulk got to that big lost & found junk planet. In conclusion I highly recommend those who haven't seen Thor Ragnarok to go see it when you can."
31 March 2018,s-92573,0,2,9,Superheroes and jokes,"It's been a long time since I watched the movie in the theatre the first time. I wasn't of fan of marvel or any other superhero movies before I watched Thor Ragnarok. Thanks to the movie, I am a big fan of MCU now. 
Lots of jokes and laughter in the theatre, the audience were all laughing. A middle aged man sat next to me with his little son, the father laghted even harder than his son did. 
It's the third standalone movie of Thor and we can see a totally different Thor. He grew up and was much more mature than he was in the previous Thor movies. Honestly, all Thor has been through can be regarded a tragedy, even there are lots of jokes. Thor he lost his father, hammer, an eye and homeland. He save the gods from the prophesy of Ragnarok, but they met Thanos in the end of the movie, which was really worrisome. Now we can tell from the trailer of Avengers: Infinity war, it's not a happy ending. 
Jokes are good and people love jokes. 
In this movie, Loki is with his brother and all the asgardians. Finally, he is not jealous of his brother ascending to the throne. Because Thor is worthy. 
I didn't read any comics of Thor, or any of other characters among Avengers. But I love the MCU and all the heroes. I like the actors and their performances. Can't wait to see Avengers: Infinity war in the theatre."
5 June 2018,timopheykremlev,0,0,7,Too much fun is not always good.,"Marvel is a good source of entertainment movies and they prove it once again. But in case of Thor: Ragnarok(2017) i find that humor can be excessive and ruin perception of other movies. I like the plot, music, actors... But even good cake can be spoiled if you add too much sugar!"
17 July 2020,elradsoldier,0,7,5,"A good movie, an average Marvel movie and a quite bad Thor movie","Yes, This is a good movie. Visual Effects a good, humor is there, and all in all the plot is good enough for a popcorn movie.Now, As a Marvel movie, in regard with all the other MCU productions, I'm not really disappointed nor really satisfied. Some scenes are really nice and the face to face with Hulk in the Arena is nice. It gave me the impression of a mix between Thor, Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy. It's colourful, the humor is good at some time, childish at others, but I let myself watch it until the end despite........the 18 first minutes nearly made me eject my dvd and throw it through the window... Childish humor, stupid initial situation, the plot makes no sense when you come from Thors the Dark World... how come that Loki did Banish Odin ? And sorry but this thor is, to me, the worst of the three. The first was really nice and enjoyable. The second was also good but it began to slightly walk on a slippery slope.Then Ragnarok nearly falls flat... and that is horrible. Jokes after jokes, Thor and Loki are tracing back to their childhood behaviour. I don't know why this film did received so much praise (on second thought, yes I know why) because as a thor movie, it's not good enough. I could have been so much more interesting if it had stayed on its Ragnarok subtitle name.So I prefer watching it as a good Marvel movie where heroes have fun finishing in a garbage dump and trying to escape it while recovering an old friend disappeared at the end of Age of Ultron.And don't get me wrong, this very fact is quite coherent within the MCU. I've got nothing to say against it. And that's why I'm not 100% negative about the scenario.But Thor deserved far better than this. And sadly I've watched this in the new Star Wars trilogy that is sending nearly everything Star Wars had built to the trash...So don't take this movie as a bad movie, it just doesn't fit really well in the Marvel Thor universe."
3 November 2017,ace_mb,1,8,10,Cosmic Level Satisfaction,Thor Ragnarok continues the search for Infinity stones after Age of Ultron. Thor was imprisoned by Surtur and then managed to escaped by the help of Skurge. The fight between Thor and Surtur was epic just because it has The Immigrant Song in it. I didn't think it would play twice though... Overall i could say that every actor and actress steal the scene and that including Korg voiced by Taika Waititi himself. This movie give me everything i wanted as action superhero movie... Can't wait for Infinity War...

Thor Ragnarok by Taika Waititi Movie ReviewIn my opinion Thor Ragnarok by Taika Waititi is a masterful film that helps breathe new life into Thor, who up until now really has not had much depth other than being really strong, honorable, and the prince of Asgard. Although many people may think that Thor Ragnarok is another flashy superhero movie that was only made to expand the marvel superhero universe and make a quick buck, it's a extremely well made movie that expertly uses the classic format of a tragic hero to show the lose and rise of Thor. This is the reason why I felt that Thor Ragnarok is an extremely well done film because it isn't so much a superhero movie as much as it is a story of a tragic hero made for a more modern audience.
 The background behind Thor Ragnarok is that Thor has left Midgard, Earth, to go back home because he's dreamt of Asgard falling and Ragnarok, the Norse version of the apocalypse, starting. When he gets back to his home however he finds that Odin, his father, has actually been Loki, his younger adopted brother and god of chaos, in disguise and that Odin has been exiled to Earth in a retirement home by Loki. Thor confronts Loki and forces him to take him back to earth where they find that the retirement home has been destroyed and that Loki has no idea where Odin is. Before they can set out to try and find Odin however they get intercepted by Doctor Strange, the mystical protector of Earth against evil cosmic entities like Loki. After a brief discussion he helps them get to Odin on the account of that the have to leave earth as quickly as possible because of the huge threat three gods pose to earth. When they finally arrive to where Odin is, he says that it's almost his time to die and confesses that the two brothers have an older sister who's name is Hela and is the goddess of death. Hela is extremely powerful and draws her power from Asgard. Before the two brothers can hear much more Odin dies and Hela arrives on Earth to confront the two brothers and tries to kill them. Thor tries to fight Hela on Earth because he believes that if she's on Earth then she's at her least powerful because she's far away from Asgard. However even on Earth, she's powerful enough to break her Thor's magical hammer into pieces. Loki sees this, panics, and calls for the Bifröst, which is the bridge between worlds, to teleport them back up to Asgard. In the Bifrost the three get into a fight where Thor falls to Sakaar and is captured by a slave trapper called Scrapper 142 who takes him to Sakaars ruler, the Grandmaster, where Loki has already integrated himself. The only way out of Sakaar is through the Contest of Champions where he fights the Hulk, an Avenger and extremely powerful giant who uses anger as the source of his power, and almost manages to win by unlocking his inner power as the god of lightning and unleashing a powerful lightning blast, but is cheated out of his victory by the Grandmaster. Thor then through a series of events manages to convinces Scrapper 142, who turns out to be a Valkyrie which are an old race of powerful woman warriors who almost all died at the hands of Hela, and the Hulk, who has now turned back into Bruce Banner, to help him escape and save Asgard. Meanwhile on Asgard Hela, who it turns out to be the former executioner for Odin, has risen the ancient and dead army along with her pet wolf. She also appoints Skurge, who was put in charge of protecting the Bifröst, as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall, the original protector of the Bifröst, has stolen the sword that activates and controls the bifrost and is leading a rescue team to protect the Asgardians from Hela. The movie concludes with an intense final battle against Hela and her army of the undead. In this fight Thor loses his eye and is nearly killed by Hela who is much stronger than he is. It isn't until he's pushed to the brink of death when he finally understands his father and unleashes his most powerful lightning blast yet against Hela, claiming and mastering his power as the god of thunder. Skurge, Helas aforementioned executioner, also redeems himself in this fight and sacrifices himself to save his people which I thought was a great way to wrap up his character arc. Throughout the movie Skurge has served as a great foil to Thor as someone who wants to do what's right, but is terrified of Hela and wants to save himself as well. He takes up the mantel as Hela's executioner because of his own instinct for self-preservation and by sacrificing himself at the end of the movie Thor Ragnarok does an excellent job showing that anyone can be a hero. The movie reaches its climax in a brilliant twist ending that strays away from the traditional ""Unlocking inner strength and overpowering the villain"" trope, which again shows off Thor's development of a simple fighter to a more complex and intuitive leader. In this twist Hela simply proves to be too strong to beat while on Asgard, which again is her main source of power. So in order to defeat her Thor and his crew have to destroy Asgard by starting Ragnarok, the very thing that Thor was trying to prevent. It's an amazing and satisfying ending that completely surpassed all of my expectations. 
In conclusion Thor Ragnarok is a great movie because of much it adds a lot of depth to Thor who up to this point hasn't been a very complex character. Throughout the movie we see him grow from the stereotypical strong and brawny fighter without a lot of brains into a unique character who has gone through so much loss and hardship and really fought for his happy ending. On top of that the movie has actual lose in it with Thor losing an eye and Asgard burning to the ground. Most movies nowadays often decide to go with a cop out death or injury and the fact that Thor Ragnarok breaks away from this by showing actual consequences is extremely satisfying and shows just how terrifying Hela is as a villain. The supporting characters are so thought out and interesting with different and unique personalities. It also helps breathes new life into Bruce Banner who hasn't really been fleshed out before and makes him a funny and honestly likable character with some of the best lines in the film. Korg, a soft spoken, but powerful rock monster who is seen in the gladiator holding cells on Sakaar, is easily one of the greatest and funniest characters throughout the film. Skurge is a complicated character that shows the struggle between self-preservation and a sense of duty to what is morally right. He is a great representation of human error and extremely relatable in that he acts how most of us would realistically do in a scenario where an all powerful goddess of death comes down to kill an entire planet. Hela is a powerful and extremely dangerous villain with a compelling background and motivation which a lot of superhero movies lack. It's an excellent superhero movie that breaks apart from the norm and I highly recommend it for fans of the Avengers movie series. It is a bit harder to understand if you haven't watched any of the other movies, but even on its own Thor Ragnarok remains one of the highlight movies of 2017."
3 November 2017,dhruvchauhano,0,6,8,Hela is the best,"This movie is the reflection of the injustices towards girl child and the citizens in real life. This movie begins with the arrogant boy of Odin, the so-called successor of Asgard. It appears that he is before Surtur, the lord of fire for some peace talk or negotiation, and he is very rude to Surtur. It seems that Thor, the arrogant and spoiled brat of Odin, is trying to provoke unarmed Surtur and his loyal people. Because of the rude behaviour of Thor, very elderly and scholar Surtur get provoked and starts a fight with Thor. However, Thor defeats Surtur by playing his mystical powers. It appears that Thor had preconceived plan to trap Surtur instead of negotiating with him and thereafter retiring his father to only capture Odin's throne. It is a classic play of the current day politicians also to project a comparatively mild threat as very dangerous and thereafter using it to their political advantage.Thereafter Thor meets Odin. Odin seems very tired after witnessing all the constant fights between his two sons Thor and Loki. He feels that he committed a mistake by not passing the throne to his rightful heir Hela. Hela is the firstborn of Odin. It is a common practice and law of Asgard that the throne passes to the firstborn of the King. This law was made by Odin himself, but now he regrets as the firstborn was a daughter. He was ashamed of her, but he raised her anyways under the fear of the public. He assigned his daily burden on her shoulder such like fighting his wars and conquering unknown lands, with a hope that one day she will die and the crown will pass to his boy Thor. However, Odin didn't succeed in his evil plan and instead Hela survived through all his tricks and conquered almost everything. Hela followed the command of her father without questioning him, with a hope that she will get to finally witness the true love of her father. But when she asked for her right, she was exiled and thereafter imprisoned. This also happens in our society where the girl child is always discriminated by her parents. After hearing the news of that her father has passed away, she came to know that she has two brothers, who were conceived after her exile. She asked nicely for the burial rights and her right to the throne, which was denied rudely by brats of Odin. She somehow reached to the capital and a whole army was standing against her. She realised that the army was equipped with swords and shields. She then thought as to how the Asgardian lifestyle and standards have degraded since the time she left. During her time and also during the invasion of Loki, the army was equipped with laser guns and ultramodern equipment. She felt very sorry for her people as the people were living in primitive conditions and still wearing very dull and degrading clothes in compare to the people in power who were wearing all shiny rugs and designer clothes. She at one point of time thought that instead of landing at Asgard, she landed in North Korea. In order to prevent another situation like French Revolution, she decided to snatch the throne in the interest of Asgard. But this was not in accordance with the plan of Thor. Ragnarok is the story of how Thor becomes a hurdle in the Nobel plans of Hela for her people of Asgard and thereafter Thor assassinates Hela by crook. Don't be like Odin. Be like Hela, instead of being evil Satan like Thor."
18 December 2017,robduder,0,3,7,Is there even a reason to review Marvel films anymore?,"Someone recently said Superhero films were the Millenium's version of the Western and that may be accurate. Westerns were around for a very, very long time and changed cinema history and there are some really good ones and some really terrible ones. No matter what you have to give insane kudos to Disney and Marvel for creating the largest cinematic Universe ever spanning Television and film and knocking it out of the park every...single....time. What was their mis-step out of 20+ films? The Incredible Hulk? Maybe. They've recouped that a hundred times over. I haven't always been super impressed with everything they've done and I do think certain aspects of the franchise is showing wear. The first Thor I actually thought was one of their least impressive films but the second one I thought was absolutely incredible. Thor Ragnorak falls somewhere in the middle for me. However, that's on sheer entertainment because as I read some things on this film I realized the sheer dept and fan service they pay to true comic fans. I was always a DC Comics kid so I miss a lot of the Easter eggs but Marvel fans must be over the moon. The film also is much more comedic than others in the Universe, above and beyond what would normally be there and honestly (especially in the beginning) it felt a little forced. The CGI is decent and the characters are a ton of fun. I honestly think Ragnarok was built for the die hard Thor and Hulk fans and they probably love it.Chris Hemsworth returns to the role as the God of Thunder. Hemsworth is one of the Marvel castings that was done with complete perfection. God help anyone ever having to play this role after him. In Ragnarok I found he wasn't quite as ""strong"" as he was in other films but then that also makes sense too given the storyline. He still commands the film perfectly and best of all his ego doesn't get in the way of the other characters. He shares the spotlight perfectly. Mark Ruffalo also appears as Bruce Banner and The Hulk. I personally think they made The Hulk look more like him. I'm not a Ruffalo fan and I never thought he was particularly well cast but he does well in this. He's basically always the same as Banner. He and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Tessa Thompson joins the team and apparently it's a huge deal for fans as she plays Valkyrie. She is a great character and perfect in her role. I loved the setup for her friendship with Hulk. I could see her carrying her own film. Tom Hiddleston also returns with perfection as Loki. He and Hemsworth have always had incredible chemistry and it's great seeing him back. He's one of the best anti-heroes/sometimes villains in movies. And you can't hav a great hero with a villian or in this case a villainess as Cate Blanchett takes that role. She is one of my least favorite actrors (I know...blasphemy) but she is good in this part. She is perfect given the story. Also to be honest, I knew she looked familiar but I couldn't place her at all until I read here. As with many Marvel films but especially Ragnarok the supporting cast is amazing. Jeff Goldblum, Idris Elba, Karl Urban (fantastic role), Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi (who is also the director and he gives an amazing voice role in a hilarious and fun turn as 'Korg' who was easily my favorite character in the movie.
Taika Waititi is not a well known director and yet he handles this big budget Marvel spectacle expertly. I can't imagine what it must be like handling these characters and the special effects and the lore and the story and do so quite well. The space travel alone is incredible and the battle scenes as well and the amount of choreography and people involved. So really my review is this ... for me who is not a huge Marvel fan but respect the heck out of this massive Universe and the popcorn type fun it provides, it was okay on the scale of what they've offered. But for those of you who adore Marvel and have been fans all your lives, I think you'll be blown away by this and the Easter eggs are plentiful. This definitely shows that the universe is not in danger of slowing down anytime soon. 7/10"

Power of storm and light that is given to Thor in this movie, i am assuming that this power may be the replacement with hammer. Thor with this power is also looking killer but hammer... I don't know why but i am sure Marvel did it for a reason and we can see Thor next time in Avengars: Infinity War, i want to see him with hammer and also with that power."

11 November 2017,lukaskr-81091,0,11,9,Surprising movie,"So the film was good, it has lot of humor in it, i wouldn't be angry if it had a little more drama, however when it has to be dramatic it is so i am okay with that, and i would say that basically its one of the best marvel films. I was surprised that final fight was between two villains and I was Also surprised how Dr. Strange was just doing what he wanted with two GODS, they were like his puppets. I am also happy that Thor is buffed, because before without his hammer he was weak as ...well you know..., and now finally he is The REAL GOD, but there is one thing that i have to say and that is that the actor who plays Grandmaster plays him so super good and that post-credit scene, how he played them he's just the best. Hela as the villain was really good, however i was surprised that her only abilities were to create swords and throwing them(it was weird but not mainstream, and also she can create like a lot of them and very big if she want and throwing them super fast) and also super-strength. And the last thing... I am happy that Thor had really big progress in this movie alongside with Hulk.(and sorry for my English i know i am not very good :DD)big spoilersFunny how they hid the electricity in the trailer when Thor fought Hulk and how they hid that Thor's one eye was devastated."

15 December 2017,buystuff-56873,0,2,7,"The first two were heroic, this one was corny","Thor is my favorite MCU series. After that, Frigga is my favorite MCU character, and fortunately she was the only one spared recasting by the Ragnarok comedy hour. 
Something special happens when a heroic story line is infused with comedic tones. That's not so easily said when the opposite happens. The previous Thor films were meaningful, moving even. On the other hand, Thor: Ragnarok was an avalanche of slapstick and standup-not a minute's rest. The hodgepodge of plots and backstories was unsatisfying, but when you realize that Hulk has more lines than Heimdall, you begin to understand what's missing. The part about Odin, Allfather, as earthly dementia victim didn't make sense either. On the bright side, it was nice to see Thor's powers expand after the loss of Mjolnir. In the next Thor, I hope a more serious, more powerful (and fully-sighted) King rises out of the ashes of Asgard."

Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!"

My baby and I often go to comedy clubs, we watch Colbert and Kimmel and even reruns of Carson on TV. Ragnarock really rocked it.
Most of the jokes stuck and they were delivered with fantastic comic timing in perfect deadpan.

23 June 2021,firemen-are-trashy,88,124,8,Great for pre-schoolers!,"We had our 5 year old and 3 year old see it today. It was great! They loved it. It kept their attention the whole time. They got the humorous parts and it told a pretty common story like Nickleodeon or Sunday morning cartoons. It wasn't too cheesy for us adults either. Although our family does celebrate good family movies together once a week, I think children of all faiths can enjoy this movie. It's not too preachy nor does it push any ""religious agenda."" from heathens."
28 July 2019,saraccan,263,509,4,It's a bad children's movie,"Very childish humor, boring fighting scenes and an uninteresting plot. Another very unmemorable superhero movie for me.

29 October 2017,Troy_Campbell,99,190,9,Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.,"Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order."
26 October 2017,MrDHWong,57,103,8,A much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors,"Thor: Ragnarok is the third standalone Thor movie and the fifth film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), this installment gives the Thor films a much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors.Two years after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds himself imprisoned on a distant planet where he is forced to do battle in a gladiatorial duel against his former friend, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Meanwhile, Thor's home realm of Asgard is under attack by the powerful Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans to bring it to an end during the oncoming apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok.Considering how bleak and serious the first two Thor films were (mainly the second film), Thor: Ragnarok thankfully takes a different route by injecting more humour and colour into the story to become one of the most fun and entertaining films in the MCU to date. All of the film's comedic moments worked well, and didn't feel as though they were just inserted for the sake of generic comic relief. Another issue I feel is that the original two focused too much on Loki (Tom Hiddleston), making us forget that Thor was supposed to be the main character. Thankfully, Loki, while still having an important and amusing role in the story, is merely a supporting character and Thor himself is given the proper development needed to move the film along nicely. As with all films in the MCU, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10"
13 October 2020,AngelHonesty,15,23,10,Funny and Wildly Entertaining,"I loved every moment of this film. The humour in it was spectacular! The story fun and entertaining with witty lines and great plots. The acting was better then ever with great filming and beautiful scenes! The movie had heart and depth but also humour without rushing the plot, adding the perfect amount of action to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Picking Cate Blanchett to play the goddess of death was brilliant! The woman holds such power and depth that radiates off of her being! Seeing more of Hulk in the film as Hulk himself was also wildely entertaining! Marvel definitely did a great job with this movie!"
20 October 2021,dasa108,28,46,5,Light film directed to children,"This film is aimed at a child and adolescent audience eager for jokes and a rhythm supported by the hero's hardships and the presentation of characters that without adding anything to the story at least make them smile.If I had to define a film by the sensation it leaves on the retinas, I would say that it is a film that is impossible to see twice, but that it fairly fulfills its function of entertaining. It is a forgettable pastime but at the end of the day it entertains."
29 October 2017,eddie_baggins,33,59,7,Thor goes wild in this 80's infused superhero comedy,"It's hard to know how Thor acolytes will feel about the God of Thunder's latest solo adventure, with New Zealand director Taika Waititi turning the previous Shakespearian meets modern day blockbuster like first two outings on their heads with his laughter focused/80's infused action comedy that is likely to appeal to a broader audience while also alienating some hard-core fans in the process.It's not like Thor from 2011 and Dark World from 2013 are exactly overly well-loved properties, Thor the character finding a broader appeal and resonance in the Avenger films, but Waititi's departure from what has come before is one of the greatest change of paces for a series I've ever seen.Gathering a passionate if small fan base from his work directing films Boy, What We Do in the Shadows and the critical smash Hunt for the Wilderpeople, those that have adored Waititi's work on a small budget will be pleased to know his oddball sense of humour and playful directing is still well and truly in-tact with a Marvel budget behind his every wish and imaginative idea.Barely taking a chance to catch a breath over 2 hours of runtime, Waititi throws the audience headfirst into Thor's newest life or death outing as the muscled god with a freshly minted haircut (courtesy of a particularly excited hairdresser) finds himself trying to escape Sakaar, a planet run by Jeff Goldblum's camp Grandmaster all the while dealing with his dastardly adopted brother Loki, his angry green friend Hulk/Bruce Banner and most pressingly Cate Blanchett's new villainess Hela, who has taken over Thor's home world of Asgard.It's a multi-stranded plot line but it's all there as an excuse and fodder for Waititi to showcase a new side of Thor whose grown into himself and learnt more about the universe from his time on Earth, as well as a reason to team Hemsworth with Mark Ruffaloo's Hulk as the two share a great on screen chemistry as mismatched friends.As to be expected with a Waititi film, the characters and humour are what makes his features resonate with audiences around the world and he gifts Hemsworth his best take on Thor yet while newcomers to the series Tessa Thompson as feisty warrior and likely fan favourite Valkyrie, Waitit himself doing the voice of rock fighter Korg, Goldblum as Grandmaster and Blanchett as lead antagonist Hela all fair well, clearly having a blast with Waititi's wacky and often inventive situations and executions.As fun and visually captivating as most of Waititi's movie is, Ragnarok still struggles to bring the narrative arc of the story full circle and with Waititi still undoubtedly needing to mould his film into what lays ahead for the Marvel universe, as a whole the final section of the film suffers from a rather forgettable and bland finishing act that feels incredibly lacklustre to what has come before it.Caught up also with the arc of Thor being on Sakaar, Waititi struggles to make the most of Blanchett's Hela and her whole period on Asgard never really gets out of first gear and it becomes an arguable statement that perhaps Waititi took on board to much at once and sections of the film feel the pressure from so many things going on at once.Final Say – Ragnarok is Thor gone wild, a film that's an over the top colourful mash-up of 80's stylings, action tics while on a constant search for the next punch-line.A Marvel experience that will once more light up the international box office and become a quick-fire audience favourite, there's not a lot of lasting appeal to Waititi's film other than the likelihood of it being a guilty pleasure of the Marvel film series but it's one of the years silliest and sensory overloading blockbusters that provides a great bang for your buck adventure and more laughs in a single scene than most mainstream comedies could conjure up in an entire runtime.3 ½ eager hairdresser's out of 5"

                        ",An enjoyable superhero film,"This film tells the story of the God of Thunder, who is trapped on a waste planet and has to win a tournament in order to gain back his freedom. In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evil force destroying Asgard.Perhaps inspired by the success of ""Deadpool"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"" has comedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I think there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watching it, even though I wish the superhero elements is emphasised more."
25 October 2017,bob-the-movie-man,55,101,8,"Guaranteeing a ""safe passage through the anus""","I'm neither a Marvel fan, nor (in particular) a Thor fan.. but I have to admit ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was brilliant from beginning to end. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been travelling the universe in search of stuff (I neither remember nor care) but returns to his home planet of Asgard with a dire warning of impending 'Raganrok': this being the 'End of Days' for Asgard. But he finds the court engaged in serious leisure time!Things go from bad to worse when Hela (Cate Blanchett, ""Carol"") – someone with more than a passing relationship to Thor – arrives with a mission to assume the throne. Teamed uncomfortably with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""High Rise""), the brothers get cast millions of light years away to a planet lorded over by a 'grand master' (a lovely performance, that I will leave anonymous here) who pits new gladiators in an arena against his latest champion. You'll never guess who his champion is? Well, OK (cos the trailer gives it away) he's big and green! The film's script is hilarious. It generates an enormous volume of entertainment with laugh-out loud moments throughout; the unforeseen involvement of other Marvel characters; some startling cameos all mixed with the usual brand of spectacular fights and action. Some of the action is surprising: a real eye-opener you might say.The lead cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett and Ruffalo) all perform admirably and are joined by heavyweight cameos from Anthony Hopkins (""Westworld"") and Idris Elba (""Bastille Day"") reprising their roles from ""Thor: The Dark World"". Particularly impressive is Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") as Thor's Valkyrie warrior side-kick and Karl Urban (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") as the turn-coat Asgardian Skurge.Directed by young New Zealander Taika Waititi (behind last year's successful indie hit ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"") it's a breath of fresh air for the Thor franchise, more similar to the style of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rather than the previous films in the series. Waititi also saves all the best comedy lines for himself as the 'rock warrior' character Korg: his New Zealand twang delivering just side- splitting dialogue. As with most Marvel films, its a little bit flabby in places, running to 130 minutes: some of the dialogue, particularly scenes between Hemsworth and Ruffalo, feel like they needed tightening up in the editing suite. This time of course includes the scrolling of endless teams of visual effect artists in the closing titles which – naturally – 90% of the audience stay for to see if there are any ""monkeys"". In fact,there are two: one fairly early on; the other right at the end. (To be honest, I thought neither of them was particularly worth waiting for). However overall the movie is highly recommended for a fun night out at the cinema. By the way, this is a film best viewed cold if someone tries to tell you the surprises, cut them off quick!(Thor (sic) the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks!)."
5 October 2021,BoilerYor,44,61,3,Not So Good,"Saying this is the best Thor movie is like saying Rampage is the best Uwe Boll movie (well Rampage is better than all the Marvel movies that's for sure). It's true, but it doesn't really mean much. When the bar is so low there's nowhere to go but up.Comedy is one of, if not the most, subjective genre in cinema. If the humour doesn't click with you, it's pretty much impossible to judge whether the jokes work or not, leaving you with only the story to latch onto. And the story is cliché: Hero doubting, losing or giving up their powers then getting them back. It's a tired and overused trope ever since Superman II. It's not a very good trope either and a lazy way to raise the stakes. I don't know why writers and directors love it so much. Not to mention the first Thor movie already did that.I can already tell how the pitch meeting went:Feige: Taika, people loved Guardians of the Galaxy, so make it a GOTG style comedy. People love the Hulk, so put the Hulk in it. People love buddy movies, so make it a buddy movie too. Oh, and have Thor lose his powers because that's totally something we haven't seen before in a superhero movie.Waititi: But, I can put my own personal stamp on it, right?Feige: Nope.Waititi: Okay, I have to pay the bills I guess."
25 August 2021,salsalvatore,45,61,3,Director is a Ho,I literally walked out of my living room. It's just boring. They could've done so much better but it's corny and just straight up boring. No action whatsoever and lame pre-school jokes.
22 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,113,236,10,Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game,"Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.As said in my review for 'The Death of Stalin', 2017 has been very hit and miss for films, the best ones being wonderful (I.e. 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest', 'The Death of Stalin', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Wind River', 'IT', 'The LEGO Batman Movie') and the worst ones being dreadful (i.e. 'Baywatch', 'The Snowman', 'The Emoji Movie', 'Stratton', 'Flatliners', 'The Mummy', 'Transformers: The Last Knight'). 'Thor: Ragnarok' is to me up there with the year's best. Would even go as far to say that it's one of the best and most entertaining ""superhero"" films so far, whether in Marvel, DCU or anywhere.On a visual level, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best-looking of the three 'Thor' films and of Marvel in general. Asgard looks colourful and atmospheric. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations are stunningly vivid. The special effects and stunts are not just dazzling and have substance and purpose rather than just being thrown in for the sake of it, they are among the best of any Marvel film. Just for the record, Marvel get a lot of hate, particularly in the ridiculous and blown completely out of proportion DCU vs Marvel war, have personally enjoyed a lot many of their efforts. The music pulsates thrillingly and is also catchy and rich in atmosphere and emotion.'Thor: Ragnarok', as said, is a contender for Marvel's funniest film. The dialogue crackles in wit and deadpan deliciousness, and absolutely loved Thor's quips and the clever in-jokes (Loki's horrified reaction at coming face to face with Hulk was a standout). They are all placed adeptly, placement is never questionable.It's not just about the humour that makes 'Thor: Ragnarok' so great though. Like 'Thor: The Dark World' in particular of the previous two films, the action is absolutely thrilling and breath-taking in spectacle (almost 'The Lord of the Rings'-like in scale). There is plenty of bold dark-natured tension and the emotional moments give the film a lot of heart and are genuinely moving.Taika Waititi balances humour, action and drama with ease and it shows in the compelling and tightly structured and paced story. The characters are even more expansive in development, both intrigue and entertain and their well fleshed out personalities make them easy to care for them. Thor and Loki are beautifully realised characters while Hulk is the most interesting he's been in a long time. Hela is not just the best non-Loki 'Thor' villain (so much better than the one-dimensional and underwritten villain of 'The Dark World) but also one of the best villains in the Marvel canon, not just posing a threat, interesting in personality and having a motivation that nobody will scoff at but she is also one of few Marvel villains to actually have an arc. Korg (with Waititi writing himself in to portray) is a bit random but is a lot of fun.Chris Hemsworth is at his most relaxed and charismatic, while Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. Anthony Hopkins continues to bring welcome gravitas to Odin and doesn't ham up. Cate Blanchett relishes the character of Hela, and makes her a character that's menacing, entertaining and oddly rootable.Mark Ruffalo is a strong presence as Hulk, Benedict Cumberbatch brings everything that was good about his Dr Strange in the first place and Jeff Goldblum is suitably playful. Karl Urban comes off least but does his best with the relatively little he has (which to me was nowhere near distracting enough to bring the film down).Overall, a brilliant film with Thor and Marvel being at the top of their game. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

                        ",Unexpected fun,"This is the not the film I was expecting. As the third entry in the ""Thor"" franchise, I anticipated a traditional super-hero movie like the previous two: lots of drama and threat and the occasional humorous one-liner. But this is actually the funniest by far of all the works in the Marvel canon (now 17 films) and has clearly been influenced substantially by the commercial success of the two ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movies which came out in between ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"". This makes for an immensely entertaining outing but inevitably dials down the tension. As well as different writers, we have to thank for the new style New Zealand director Taika Waititi who additionally voices the granite character Korg who could have stomped straight out of a ""GOTG"" film.As always with super-hero movies, we have lots of noise and colour together with splendid sets and effective special effects, but ultimately what makes this movie work is the cast. As well as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as brothers Thor and Loki, we have the wonderful Cate Blanchett as their gorgon-like sister Hela, another enjoyable female actress Tessa Thompson as a Valkryie, Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk, and the delightful Jeff Goldblum as an unlikely- looking villain called simply Grandmaster. The plot is rather confusing (but essentially Ragnarok = the destruction of Asgard) and the humour sometimes juvenile (a cosmic star gate is called ""the Devil's Anus""), but the whole thing is such F-U-N.Marvel movies always have a teaser clip at the end and this time we are treated to two: one early in the credits and one at the very end. The humour never stops."
30 January 2021,Salim-hakawee,62,81,2,When You Look Into Norse Mythology Or The Thor Comics...,"You notice that 'Thor' was a joker, a shyster, slapped around by his superior sister, was a charlatan, an aspiring standup comic and, therefore, Marvel got it right. They just made a movie based on historical accuracies: that Thor is a foolish silly baboon.End of sarcasm.Fans of Thor, superheroes, action or a good story can stay away."

                        ",Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.,"""Asgard is not a place, it's a people."" Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually not the physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization's abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e., becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be different because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical."

Definitely worth seeing . This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like the LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stone revolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role for Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about the franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk ) mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script and great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner and Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance was below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the reclining seats :) Pad.A 9/10"
27 October 2017,msbreviews,41,75,8,Rating: A-,"After Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it is time for Thor: Ragnarok to try and finish a very positive year for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), in great fashion.I find the previous Thor movies very interchangeable, they are not exactly great films, but they are still entertaining and enjoyable. However, Thor: Ragnarok elevates that same entertainment to a whole other level ... This is one of the funniest (!) and best movies of the entire universe.Opposed to the previous installments of the series, this one is tonally very different. The amount of comedy implemented in the screenplay and the outstanding humor make this film surprisingly hilarious and extremely fun. It is definitely a marvelous time at the theater and money very well spent.Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) fantastic direction is all over the movie. He is able to achieve a flawless balance between comedy, drama and action, something that most directors have trouble with. Consequently, the pacing feels incredibly controlled throughout the whole runtime. The 130 minutes fly like the blink of an eye and the film never has a dull moment, but it still slows down when it needs to, without becoming boring.Waititi also applies a very interesting, intriguing and unconventional way of storytelling, which truly helps the movie carry itself since the overall narrative isn't really unusual. The visual effects and cinematography are both remarkable but in the last act, the action requires a lot of CGI, which becomes too heavy in some brief moments. Due to the mostly fictional Asgard in the background, when the CGI isn't perfect, it feels like a video game ... Thankfully, I am just nit-picking a couple of shots that, in the end, didn't bother me at all.Eric Pearson's writing is distinctly exceptional with extremely hilarious lines and quite few exposition scenes (the ones that exist don't feel forced at all, except for one or two very concise bits). I believe that he is responsible for a big part of this film's sense of uniqueness and creativity, considering he provides excellent scripts for every character, upgrading each and every one of them and obtaining a more exciting movie.As for the cast, I just need to once again praise Marvel for its amazing choices, they keep nailing every single actor and actress they introduce to the MCU. Cate Blanchett is unbelievable! She is such a wonderful actress that she can portray a super cliché villain like Hela (Marvel's ""default"" villains are something that I honestly hope Thanos can change) and bring a whole other dimension to the character. Thanks to her and an extraordinary script, Hela does not feel like (what could very well have been) a cheap villain.Tessa Thompson is another brilliant casting. Valkyrie adds a new layer of comedy and sass to the film, but her backstory is what gives both herself and Blanchett's character a bit more of depth. The surprise of the whole movie is Korg, a Kronan fighter portrayed by the one and only ... Taika Waititi! You are right, the director of Thor: Ragnarok has the funniest performance of the film! I am far from joking, his lines almost steal the whole show, there isn't a single scene with Korg where I didn't laugh like crazy. It is going to be the audience's favorite, without a doubt.As for the superstars, Chris Hemsworth proves that he is a perfect Thor. Both his acting and body shape are excellent for the portrayal of a god, he is able to be very compelling but also incredibly funny, carrying the story with no slip-ups. His chemistry with Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is palpable and their dialogue scenes are always at a great level of quality, both comedy and story-wise.Hiddleston is great as the evil brother, but Hulk is the one that stands out. The big green guy speaks more in this movie than in all of the others combined and he is freaking awesome! His witty one- liners hit every single time and his action scenes are amazing. There are also some short but very cool appearances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange),  Idris Elba (Heimdall) and Anthony Hopkins (Odin), plus a surprise performance from someone I won't spoil for you.Jeff Goldblum is always great, but his character ... I know this is not going to be a very popular opinion, but I find Grandmaster a bit annoying. Karl Urban has a good performance as Skurge, but just like Hela, both characters feel unexplored and pretty under- developed.My only real issue with the film is something I already mentioned above, which is the story itself. Even though Waititi's uncommon storytelling elevates it, the overall narrative is pretty much the default superhero story. Basically, if you have been alive for the past 10 years, there is nothing about the screenplay that is going to surprise you or blow your mind. Thankfully, the movie is so damn entertaining that the narrative becomes secondary to the all of the action and comedy predominant in the film.In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok is definitely worth your time and money. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the series and one of the funniest in the MCU. Taika Waititi (with the help of Eric Pearson) molds a cliché narrative in his very unique and humorous way of storytelling, packed with hilarious comedy and phenomenal action scenes. A splendid cast with Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Cate Blanchett at the top of their game pull off some fabulous displays, but it is Tessa Thompson and Waititi (!) that steal the show with their distinguished performances, plus a big green badass that has a lot of funny one-liners.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)"

The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from the (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost – a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also a campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.For those who prefer their superheroes dark and brooding, this one will be a shock. Prepare for Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster – the most polite villain we've seen in awhile, and one who looks to be straight out of the 1960's ""Batman"" series. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is one of many returning actors/characters, only this time he really gets to flash his comic timing on top of his Thunder God biceps. His love- hate, trust-no trust, see-saw relationship with brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is the Bruce Banner banter with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's certainly more in line with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the previous movies for Avengers. As much fun as Goldblum brings to the party, this is really Cate Blanchett's show. She is the frightening (with a dash of camp) Goddess of Death, and long-lost sister of Thor and Loki, and daughter of Odin (Anthony Hopkins). With a headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Hela's enormous powers are such that she crumbles Thor's mighty hammer with little effort – just to remind everyone that big sisters are renowned for messing up younger brother's toys.Of course, with that title, we know that the story revolves around what could be the end of Asgard. Joining in the fun are: Idris Elba who is back as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as a master of one-liners Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - rewarded with a wonderful exit scene, Ray Stevenson returns as Volstagg, and rocky alien Korg who is voiced by director Waititi. Fans of the series will be happy to know other familiar faces pop up periodically – one especially magical sequence teaches Loki a quick lesson.In addition to the main rescue story line, the powerful villains, and crazy aliens, there are numerous nods and tributes to previous versions (notably Planet Hulk, and Fantastic Four), and a hilarious early stage play with three cameos that make it clear, big time laughter is here to stay. It's fun to catch the reunions from such previous projects as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park and Westworld. Special acknowledgment goes to director Taika Waititi for hilariously taking the comic book film world down a different path. He's known for his comedic projects like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favs from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and his work on the brilliant but short-lived ""Flight of the Conchords"". It's still very much a Marvel movie, with visible fingerprints of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. It's also a fantastic adventure film that sets the stage for next year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, while also featuring the best use ever of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". So get ready to rock, roll and rollick in a film that is just about as much fun as you can have in a theatre."
21 November 2017,matt_jacobs1,55,91,1,Garbage!,"Probably one of the worst movies I've ever paid to watch. Plot was predictable and corny and Hulk was an unnecessary addition to an already poorly written cast. The main Villain.....I can't even remember her name she was so bad, was potentially the worst villain in comic movie history. If you're under the age of 10 or like poorly written movies then this is for you."

                        ",Get ready to Ragnarok & Roll - this film is the most fun you'll have in a cinema all year!,"In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor (and director Taika Waititi) for that!We reunite with Thor (Hemsworth) - still free of new Infinity Stones, freshly confident that he's once again warded off the fabled Ragnarok - just as he discovers that something is rotten in the state of Asgard. As teased at the end of Thor: The Dark World, Loki (Hiddleston), his shape-shifting trickster brother, has been impersonating their ailing dad, Odin (Hopkins). When Odin's strength finally fails, the dark secret he's been keeping at bay storms into the lives of his sons: Hela (Blanchett), their bloodthirsty older sister, is back to claim the throne she believes is rightfully hers.For (largely) better or (occasionally) worse, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't dwell as much on the royal family drama as its predecessors did. Instead, its second act plays out on the candy-coated, death-dealing planet of Sakaar. Ruled by the whims and fancies of the Grandmaster (Goldblum dialled to 11), Sakaar's people are relentlessly entertained in their very own battle dome. (Think the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome, with holographic screens and super-powered alien beings.) Following an initial devastating confrontation with Hela, Thor is stranded on Sakaar, and brought in by the mercenary Valkyrie (Thompson) to stand against the raging primal force of the Hulk (Ruffalo) - not quite the ""friend from work"" Thor remembers. If that all sounds like serious business, rest assured it's very much not. There's a gentle wit threaded through every frame of this film - a glorious, big-hearted silliness that fans of Taika Waititi will remember (and treasure) from such indie comedy gems as What We Did In The Shadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Miraculously, Waititi has managed to infuse this gargantuan, green-screened epic with his trademark offbeat vibe, best exemplified in the way key plot points are revealed (via sardonic monologue or ironic stage play) and the character he plays (Korg, a chirpy rock monster who befriends Thor before our hero heads into the arena). Waititi's involvement is a blessing for pretty much everyone involved in the film, but especially for Hemsworth. It's not that he hasn't been good in his previous appearances as the God of Thunder throughout the franchise - he was suavely charming in Thor and resolutely grim in The Dark World. But he's so remarkably good here, switching effortlessly between bright-eyed puppy and care-worn leader, that it feels like he's finally come home. Hemsworth's performance in this film is a fantastic balance of sunshine, silliness and subversiveness, and it's a joy to behold.It's clear, too, that everyone in the cast - including respected veterans like Hopkins and Blanchett - were delighted to partake in the film's mirth and mayhem. Ruffalo continues to play the dual aspects of Bruce Banner - looming brute and mild-mannered professor - with so much winning charm that you want him to get his own Hulk movie, stat. Hiddleston is totally game for playing up the odd- couple comedy of Loki's rivalry with Thor, while shading unexpected complexity into his character's machinations. Thompson swaggers off with practically every scene she's in, finding the heart, humour and heroism in an Asgardian warrior who's lost her way. Perhaps more impressively, Waititi handles every Marvel blockbuster's requisite action scenes with more clarity and flair than you'd expect from an indie director. He manages to find character and comedy beats even in swooping spaceship chases and bruising hand-to-hand combat. There's a thrilling fluidity to the action sequences - whether it's Thor soaring towards his enemies like lightning made flesh, or Hela unleashing her multiple projectiles of death with a dark, graceful beauty.That's not to say Thor: Ragnarok is perfect. As it turns out, the film's greatest strength - apocalypse as afterthought - is also its biggest flaw. Waititi just about manages to find the emotional weight in Thor coming to terms with his power and leadership (a driving theme for this character), but it does get a little lost in all the knockabout comedy. Thanks to Blanchett, Hela is never less than terrifying: she oozes gleeful malevolence in her wake, forcing Thor to confront his own gold-tinted ideas of himself, his family and his history. Alas, she's also one of that peculiar breed of antagonist who's immeasurably powerful and strangely ineffective, all at the same time. For years, Marvel has been making brave choices in terms of the directors to whom it has entrusted its stories and characters. This strategy has yielded films that are, for the most part, creatively diverse, ranging in quality from decent to excellent. Even so, handing the reins of the Thor franchise to a director with such a unique voice as Waititi might have been its biggest gamble yet. Fortunately, it pays off in spades. Smart, silly and self-aware, Thor: Ragnarok is a blockbuster that feels like it snuck into cinemas by way of the art-house. It's also that rare threequel which isn't just as good as its predecessors - it's easily the best of the lot."
27 October 2017,ctowyi,268,543,8,This Thor is Thor-some!,"Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.New Zealand director Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thor's third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him and he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and he went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not been done before?Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but no less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample opportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the one thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor ""What are you, the God of Hammers? "" that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many colourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in the early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalo's casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By giving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so hilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that ""he ain't heavy, he is my brother"" vibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.Cate Blanchett plays Thor's estranged sister with evil relish and you don't cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a gladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just to a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his people. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director. The risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just to catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!"
29 October 2017,austin0731,44,79,7,A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU,"I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCU's new direction that has been commencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we had the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries Marvel's Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this experimental Marvel is coming in full force. In order for a franchise like Marvel to survive I think this new direction is very important if not necessary, it is very interesting that Marvel is now employing directors that are not necessarily the usual big budget movie directors but rather, directors of low budget movies such as Taika Waititi. Marvel Phase 3 seems to be all about having this ensemble of films with drastically different tones. We've had 2 comedies Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians 2. But we've also went into mystical/fantasy genres in Doctor Strange or serious dramas like Civil War. Not to mention the coming Black Panther that has a very estranged setting. All this is what the New Marvel has become and I think it is perfect. So, after discussing so much on the direction of the MCu I would like to pull the focus back to Thor: ragnarok, I can understand that many people did not like this film for its lack of significance in the greater scene/setting of the MCU. In fact there wasn't much stakes that carry through to the MCU and it seems very self contained. However I think that it is important to enjoy this movie as it is, the fun action sci-fi that is probably the funniest Marvel movie to date. The thing is we as audiences get so much superhero movies nowadays there is a case of superhero film fatigue and having large stakes in every single movie is just going to dilute out tastes. This current way, we can enjoy these characters in their own side stories/adventures and enjoy the big explosive moments when they come together, like a comic book crossover event! What Thor: Ragnarok does so well is that it really redefines the Thor franchise, the character of Thor himself and even the Hulk character. All the while maintaining the sense of fun and adventure. I did enjoy that they further characterized Hulk so he isn't just a raging monster but a simple minded character who has more complexity than is previously perceived. However, the comedy does come at the expense of certain climactic battle sequences and serious moments and this is sure to put certain audiences off. But overall, a thrilling, fun action movie that is sure to evoke certain controversies."
24 January 2018,bmfalex,41,52,6,Movie for kids,"5 minutes in and i was already expecting ""pull my finger"" jokes. Come on, this is a movie about puns, bad jokes and 40+ actors making silly jokes about whos has it bigger."
28 October 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,41,77,9,"Thor Ragnarok has the dumb, colourful bombastic fun cinema sorely needs right now.","Thor Ragnarok is an absolute ball of a film: it's the MCU's most enjoyable film since the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, and doesn't focus too much on sequel building like previous MCU films. Ragnarok is the kind of film that will appeal to even the most ardently cynical critics of superhero movies; it's stupid but it relishes in its self-aware sense of joy and fun.Ragnarok is eons ahead of Thor: The Dark World in my eyes, and is even better than the first Thor. It's one of those rare 'threequels' that's better than the films which came before it. And considering how supposedly 'formulaic' people are starting to perceive the MCU films, that's saying a lot of great stuff about this movie. Thor: Ragnarok has the mythological scale of something like The Lord of the Rings, the over-the-top fun of Richard Donner's Superman movies, and the extra sprinkling of The Hulk in a gladiator costume to top all this insanity off in a perfectly gorgeous combo. Oh, and it accomplishes the other-world-liness of films like The Star Wars Trilogy.Thor: Ragnarok is the Thor film I've been waiting for easily. It uses the character in a way that we unfortunately had to wait several films for to justify this payoff, but I promise you the payoff is surprisingly satisfying."
22 November 2021,dours1,28,38,2,Should Have Told Me It Is A Thor Spoof Before i Started Watching,Neither the DVD cover nor the reviews here told me this is a spoof movie mocking and doing send-offs of Thor.I wasted my time as a result.Jokes were not funny and there were no good laughs. Just bad laughs and yucky unserious situations where the actor standing in for Thor mumbles and does gags.Go home fatso.
31 October 2017,Avwillfan89,54,99,10,Definitely the funniest Marvel movie yet,"With the third Thor movie called ""Ragnarok"" which means the apocalypse, you would think it would be the darkest entry in the saga yet. Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is wonderfully funny, Tessa Thompson as Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath of fresh air and Korg (played by the director) is just as eccentrically wicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for including a bar scene where the Avengers have fun with Thor's hammer. But to be honest, I'd always welcome the Avengers having a good old time, making jokes, bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an appearance, which is amazing. He takes his job as the Sanctorum's gate-keeper very seriously and has no time for Loki's mischief. A very welcome change indeed in these troubled times."
10 November 2017,jordang73,150,259,1,Another Marvel abomination,"If you want to make a movie like this take the following items and mix them together:1- A long piece of a wrestling TV show 2- Several clips taken from Flash Gordon (the 80's version) 3- A long piece of Thor (the first installment) but without all of the kitsch (only 25 % of that is enough to vomit) 4- A Rhianna video clip 5- A movie trailer from Narnia 6- Several pieces of different really bad historical movies from the 50's (Cleopatra, all those kind of things) so you can show a sufficient amount of ridiculous sets. 7- A clip from Battlestar Galactica 8- Whatever other garbage you can getThen take the mix and pour it into a waste disposal tank of an airplane after a long transatlantic trip. The resulting mix will be something similar.And thanks once again to Hollywood for flushing norse mythology down the toilet.Greetings from Scandinavia!"
15 November 2021,ProjectAnomaly,18,30,2,Thor: Ragnarok,"Tonally confused, obnoxious characters, Hulk didn't need to be there, Hela was painfully stereotypical, setup took way too long, and the cheesiest, most implausible Overcomer (TM) moment in all of film history."
3 November 2017,thebricks,19,31,4,Had a lot of issues with this film's presentation and marketing,"First of all, it was very obvious the director was a no-name beginner they took a gamble on. It was hard to take the movie seriously because it never took itself seriously. I like humor in my movies, but every scene tried to shoe in situational joke after joke to the point of absurdity. The blue rock man was the worst. I presume he was voiced by that annoying actor from Flight of the Conchords, Jerome whatever. The director got so obsessed with his jokes that the plot of the movie got lost in it all and it was hard to take Hela seriously.As for Hela, I could never buy her as a serious villain. Cate Blanchett did a good job, but she was an afterthought in this movie. You knew she was the bad guy, and that was that. Her story arc was as generic, boring and non-threatening as it gets. I mean, Thor has known his dad for what, thousands of years, but he never bothered to tell him about her? Really? No one else in Asgard told Thor and Loki about her? Not even the Frost Giant king? Come on. She comes and goes in the film barely registering an impression other than looking attractive. Karl Urban is totally wasted in the Marvel universe as a lame henchman when he's totally capable of much, much more. That was the biggest tragedy of the whole film.Marvel keeps pulling this stunt where a character's weapon, home or whatever gets destroyed, leaving the viewer wondering how the character will deal with this in the sequel. We all know what's going to happen, they're just going to have said weapon, home or equipment magically respawn and never explain what happened. They've done this with Iron Man's suits, Captain America's shield, Asgard's bifrost and now, Thor's hammer. You will see Thor get his hammer back in Infinity War without any sort of explanation. It's just bad storytelling.Last but not least, the trailers completely ruined the movie. It would have been a much better film without all the ads thrown in your face everywhere, revealing the Hulk's appearance in the movie and Hela destroying the hammer. There were no surprises. Dr. Strange could have easily been cut out without anything lost, why not spam the trailers with his scenes? There were plenty of other action scenes that would have spiced up the trailers just as well. I feel that the director of this film got boned as badly as the one who directed Terminator Genisys, who ironically, was the same guy who directed the last Thor! What are these studio exec fools thinking?The best thing about this movie was Tessa Thompson playing Valkyrie. She was another actress totally wasted on a lame sidekick role. Why not make her Captain Marvel? She's far more believable as a leading lady superhero than Brie Larson! What a WASTE. I'm going to presume they're going to make her the female Thor? Please don't do this, for the love of God."
26 November 2021,triggered-anti-vaxxer,29,38,2,All The Top Reviews Are Right,This is a clusterfluckWhat a clusterfluck!!!Where to begin?.. This was horrible. What a horror to sit for this one.I think this is the worst superhero movie in 20 years. It is not even a superhero movie. It is Ted 3.What is wrong with people to give this movie a good review?
26 October 2017,j_forbesy,52,95,10,Thor: Ragnarok Review,"Thor: Ragnarok is coming out at a time where people are starting to ask if we have reached comic book fatigue. To that, Thor: Ragnarok puts a big cross through that thought. Thor changes the game. We can't get tired of a sub-genre when the films keep reinventing themselves every time.Ragnarok is a blast start to finish. If you are someone who liked laughing, then you will have a smile from start to finish. Every bit of humour hits and if you are an Australian like me, you will get a kick out of a few jokes.If Ragnarok was a chain, there would not be a weak link. While some links are weaker than others, there is no outright weak part of the film. Everything was at the minimum, just solid. Every character felt like like they were used close to their potential. Every actor and actress put in the performance they needed. You felt like 99% of characters were done perfectly. The only slight complaint that can be had about characters in this film was the villain of Hella.Like most Marvel villains, she is terrifically performed by Kate Blanchett and she is a force when she needs to be, but by the time Black Panther comes around next year, she will be quite forgettable. What they did do well with her however was use her to set up some terrific Thor history.As mentioned, the humour was outstanding, and I think that comes down to Taika Waititi. While he didn't get a writing credit on the film, you know by the style of the humour that he had a lot of input into what was happening on screen.While still on Taika, his directing was fantastic. There are some shots in this film that I want as a wallpaper because they are look like they should be paintings. The action was shot really well, the emotional moments had an intimate to them and of course the wide shots of the landscapes were brilliant.Something I really noticed this is the use of the music. They really tapped into the Guardians music style and it worked so well with what was happening on screen. They had a nice balance of using songs when needed but working in score when it is much needed.Ragnorok is a film that if you are going to have a problem with something, chances are it is going to be something personal. For me, what stood out as a negative was the pacing, however that comes of the back of a massive positive. This film is trying to balance two stories that could have easily been a film separately, and does a really good job of it, however I felt as though the Ragnorok story line did feel a bit short changed at the end. They weave the two stories well but at the end of the day, Thor can only be present in one story at a time.Overall, Thor: Ragnorok is a blast from start to finish. It captured the humour and light hearted fun that the first Guardians had and took it to a level you wouldn't of been able to think of. Taika Waititi was by far the stand out of the film both infront and behind the camera, and it couldn't have been achieved without him. As mention, if the film was a chain, the weakest link would still be over 90% strong.9.5/10"

                        ",We Are About To Find Out If Thor The God Thunder Really Exists Or Not,"We are about to find out.They turned Thor into a loser who is constantly delivering gags. I am glad they satisfied the fie-year-olds who are Marvel's audience, but anyone who is serious should read the comic books instead."
28 January 2018,stermix501,15,23,1,is this a movie?,"No this is not a movie. Oversimplistic plot, zero character development, zero acting.
Why did they bring all this great actors? for nothing! Why did they need oscars' Kate Blanchett for a superficial villain who just kills a few people? What did the presence of Matt Damon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Karl Urban added to the movie? Nothing! A few scenes, a few lines to make a couple of jokes and that's it. Idris Elba could bring some dramatic effect, but no. I can go like that for the rest.Yes some images are beautiful (although much less than previous movie, the pair Thor - Loki had some nice opportunities, but even them seemed too fake, too one-liners, too child acting. Even when delivering some 1st grade jokes they did it so badly. Marvel continues its own Ragnarok. Maybe they target the youngest audience in purpose to ensure future gains, or the silliest. Just look at the positive reviews, they either venerate Marvel as a perfect God, or their reviews are similar to the movie's cheesy lines on simplistic arguments."
27 October 2017,paulijcalderon,48,87,7,Thor reinventing himself with the backdrop of an 80's synth,"Thor must stop Ragnarök! It's back again: The Marvel machine. Pumping out more and more movies for you. This movie is what you expect. It's a fun, enjoyable party. It's difficult to hate it, because you realize the movie itself isn't taking things that seriously. This time around they are more self-aware than usual. I liked that addition. It's true that we are so many movies in and you question when it will get tiresome. But to my surprise they shape-shifted the franchise again and got out on top. I never expected that I would like a third ""Thor"" film as much as I did. It's unexpected, but I'm so glad they took some chances by not making the same movie again. If you've had a stressful week or just a bad day, then you will not have a good time watching something that's too dramatic. That's when something like ""Ragnarok"" steps in. It's a nice refresher. Forget your problems for an hour and follow Thor while he jumps around with 80s synth music. The first act is basically a classic ""Thor"" sequel. But things pick up as soon as our hero lands on Sakaar, and the film enters an edgy science fiction zone. It's funny, full of great jokes. It's distracting at first because its obvious how much the humor has been turned up compared to some previous chapters. I easily started enjoying it though. Everyone had fun making this movie and that fun feeling transcends to me as well.Cate Blanchett's Hela is one of those scenery chewing villains. It's classic, but whenever we cut back to her it does feel like an entirely different film. Like with ""Homecoming"", I enjoyed the character interaction scenes more than the action. The final battle feels like an easy training match. It's like we are on autopilot, but then again we get some neat visual elements. Every supporting character is great for this story. The Hulk, Loki, Grandmaster, Valkyrie.. They are all like-able. Jeff Goldblum is playing himself and its fantastic for what it is. Also, the director of the movie plays one of the best new characters. There really isn't much that I can add to the things that everyone else already is saying. It would sound that I'm just repeating every other review for this film. The truth is that ""Ragnarok"" is a very laid-back watch with some retro feels sprinkled in just the right scenes. Know this though; It doesn't strive to become emotionally engaging or inspirational in any way. It won't hit you in the feels as they say. But it's a funny space party where every friend is included and appreciated."
25 October 2017,joshbarton15,181,365,10,An utter blast,"Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait."
28 October 2017,sam_smithreview,41,74,8,How comic movies should be made,"Had the pleasure of watching Thor on the opening night, and damn was this movie good. The trailer and previous films have nothing on this third installment. Now do not get me wrong, I am not some crazy fan boy, but I give credit, where credit is due. The film was hilarious and makes this action packed film seem like a great 90's comedy, the one where you laugh at funny jokes and not silly skits or genital reference. The film had really awesome colors and amazing cinematography.The acting in the film was for most part great, few exceptions can be listed, and there were few moments where you can see actor trying to stay in character and they are trying to not to laugh, but it can be excused as 80% of dialogue was improvised, and i guess its just natural reaction of people laughing at something. One of the funniest things of the film was definitely the director, the amazing great job he did directing, as well as his hilarious character Korg and that funny Kiwi accent that makes you laugh every time he spoke.Like I wrote at the start, this is how comic movies should be made."
31 October 2017,carlos37andre,50,94,8,Another really fun Marvel movie,"I saw many people in the internet complaining about the ""fun vibe"" of the movie. Well, guys, IT'S A MARVEL MOVIE! What the heck are you expecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly what I receive. Didn't you?Look, I'm a really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvel movies, I really believe that in some of them it doesn't work at all (like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarok for me was a improve, comparing with the other Thor movies (the first one suck, and the second it's fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic skills (way better than his ""dramatic"" ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc (you get it, the cast is great).The movie isn't a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away from that, they bet on the save (again), but this time works. Cate Blanchett is F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when you think in the MCU (you know... the majority of the villains in the movies suck). So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining, fun, and well done Marvel movie. Doesn't will win an Oscar or something, but it's good, and mainly, a lot better than the first two."
25 October 2017,hiraishinnojutsu,60,110,9,One of the greatest movie of the year rocks like Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song!,"I mean seriously, no kidding! that breathtaking opening action scene, that exhilarating fight scene between Thor and Hulk on the arena, those countless hilarious scenes that literally made me laugh out loud (seriously!), that touching moment with Odin, that sad but satisfying ending, that shocking first post-credit scene, and the list goes on and on and on made this movie the greatest, the most epic, and the most awesome superhero movie of the year! (whether or not ""Justice League"" could live up to that title, I guess we'll never know until November the 17th arrives) Some critics (or maybe just one, I dunno) say that ""Thor Ragnarok"" is the boldest Marvel movie to date, in which I say it's true! I mean, how they stir and twist one of the greatest and the most well- known mythology in the world into a super-hilarious comic book movie (that perhaps upsets some people in the Scandinavian countries, from which the epic tales of Thor originated) that people and fans love is the key to Marvel Studios success. I never knew who Taika Waititi was before, but after I saw his movie yesterday, I can confidently say that he is one of the most promising new names in fully-packed- action-movie genre in the history of Hollywood.now that I have watched this movie yesterday, I'm now looking forward to watching other Marvel Studio movies in the years to come such as Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, Captain Marvel, and the most importantly, Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel. The wait is killing me, wake me up when those movies arrive on the theater, will ya?"
30 October 2017,Figgy66-915-598470,37,68,10,A great instalment from Marvel,"30 October 2017 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Thor: Ragnarok. This is another outing for Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a very welcome return it is too. Joining him is the enigmatic Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffolo as Banner/Hulk and Idris Elba reprising his role as Heimdall. We once again find ourselves immersed in a gladiatorial contest between good and bad with Thor the central character binding it all together. This outing to Asgard is very much more slapstick than the previous ones and there are many more moments of genuine mirth amongst all the fighting and slaying. Having said that, it in no way detracts from the story and from the core characters that have formed the stable of Marvel stories over the years. Add one Jeff Goldblum as a larger than life caricature of himself into the mix and you have a thoroughly entertaining film. I want to see this again and soon. Oh and people......it's a Marvel film.....stay until the end of the credits!!!!!!"

                        ",Simply epic,"Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, ""Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite."" Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, ""Ehh.. okay"", but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.8.5/10"
19 April 2021,sammielimehouse-84658,11,16,9,Way Better than the First Two Movies,"This movie was unbelievably better than the first two movies and it's not even close. It was funnier, had better action, better effects, just better everything. Although I do think that some of the comedic moments undercut the dramatic ones, which is a little frustrating, but it doesn't sour my thoughts about the movie in any way. I also love how they incorporated Hulk into the story and he and Thor's relationship throughout the movie. Overall, this is easily the best movie of the Thor trilogy, and is a great precursor to Infinity War.8.5/10."
26 November 2017,DesiBaba,16,25,3,"Hollywood, please stop making these garbage Marvel movies.","Gosh, how many of these does Hollywood need to produce? How about we start making movies for adults with real stories and characters? I mean I like an occasional super-hero movies, but this obsession with big budget Marvel movies is turning cinephiles off. I usually end up seeing this with younger family members who want to see these, I would never see these on my own, not even if I get paid to it. And the 8.x rating made me laugh and cringe, IMDb ratings are a joke and totally unreliable."
23 August 2020,harriet-bloom,90,127,3,I guess for pre-teens!?,"This movie, in the utmost simplicity, is a film that does not contain a story or an entertaining message. It is just a work that relied on sequelititis as a primary and official source in order to gain money and build a fan base in addition to the prequels, which is for me something that increased my hatred for this movie. I lost my time and money."
29 October 2017,rebeccalucy,63,115,7,A great marvel film!,"There are some beautiful shots and colours in this film! Especially a slow scene with the Valkyrie girl, just visually stunning. The poster for this film being one of my favourites of the year.This one contains a lot more action and comedy, similar in tone to guardians of the galaxy. Could be considered a good or bad thing but I liked it. Furthermore some minor characters like Heimdall are expanded upon, which is great because I really enjoy his character. However you need to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, don't watch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves quite fast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. Overall I would hold this in high regard, just under Captain America: civil war and The Avengers."

MCU rocks. hahahaa I am so ckool. This was an introduction to Mr Thor from MCU and it was funny funny marvellos and fabulous. All of us in the theatre (there was so long a queue to get in) laughed nad laughed and we all decided to start a letter writing campaign to Mr, Disney to beg for more.

25 October 2017,leaugebrett,58,104,8,An Enjoyable Technicolor Superhero Flick,"Thor Ragnarok leaves the bland formula from it's first two films for an exciting and self-aware redemption story, traversing through the trash heap planet Sakaar and an Asgard under siege. Sakaar was my favorite setting out of any recent Marvel films, with Jeff Goldblum giving a hilarious performance as a playful dictator and the arena-centric atmosphere providing an intriguing set piece. Blanchett plays the best villain of the Thor trilogy, Elba's character is essentially Aragon from LOTR, and Tessa Thompson and Marc Ruffalo/Hulk are respectively well- motiaved and solid comic relief."

OK, this is not the first time IMDb lets me down, but cmon people, this is really fun. All the actors, especially Jeff Goldblum obviously had great fun in this movie. Don't miss it! P.S: I also cannot understand the hype around Guardians of the Galaxy. OK it's fun too - but saying this movie is ""GotG wannabe"" is seriously unfair. It may rather be other way around!"

16 May 2018,Platypuschow,14,25,8,Thor Ragnarok: Marvel deliver yet again,"I admit it, I'm not exactly a Thor fan. I think the first two Thor feature films were passable efforts but paled in comparison to other heroes outings. For this reason I went in expecting a whole lot of meh!Now Ragnarok was critically acclaimed, I never heard a bad thing about it despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the trailer at all.So with a new Thor outing, sprinkles of Planet Hulk and more humour than usual (Especially from Thor) how'd I think it did?From the opening moments with Thor swinging from a chain awkwardly rotating as he's trying to have a conversation I was gripped. This wasn't the dull boring stoic Thor we'd grown to accept, this guy was cracking of the wise and I was laughing by buttocks off.Cate Blanchett delivers as Hela like I never expected she'd manage, Jeff Goldblum is excellent in a role he felt almost born for and the entire thing is one joke filled roller coaster ride that I enjoyed considerably more than I expected to.Did all the comedy diminish the impact of the Marvel Universe? Oddly not, it fit in perfectly even when a serious moment was underlined with a goofy slapstick laugh.Kudos to Marvel once again, so far out of every single MCU movie I've only disliked 2 and for a harsh critic like me that's really something.So much fun, so many laughs and has freshened up a character that in this guys opinion was getting a bit stale. Damn good job.The Good:Cast do a great jobGenuinely funny stuffThe Bad:Could have done more with the Planet Hulk story arcThings I Learnt From This Movie:This is where Hulk and Thor were during Civil War!!!!Immigrant Song just makes any scene betterIt's probably best Jaimie Alexander (Lady Sif) couldn't be part of the filmHulk talking is weird, confusing and please make it stop"
28 October 2017,maindraaritomo,36,64,9,Enjoyful joking around super heroes,"As we all see, Marvel is finding its style on every each of its movie, which is, for cash we spent to see them, we really had great times, laughing loud. A brilliant idea from Marvel, how superheroes are still human with common senses. They sometimes go reckless, silly, scared, hopeless, desperate, making fun to each other. This idea won't stand a chance at first, no place for vulnerable, or worse, joking around superheroes. It is about strategy, to be different, unique, and lasting longer, last but not least, for how fun the audience inside theater and after. Well done!"
6 July 2022,kobemackenzie,3,3,9,The best Thor movie so far!,"Thor: Ragnarok took on a different Director Taika Waititi
And he did a amazing job, he brings a fantastic story with great writing and makes Thor into a more funny and strong guy instead of the always serious God. The music is a pop and the shots look amazing but it's the cast the make this movie so good.Chris Hemsworth brings more of a comedic Version of Thor to this movie and it works so well! Tom Hiddleston come back as Loki and he is as lovable as ever in this movie. Cate Blanchett plays Thors sister and the main villain in this movie, she really brings a menacing character to this movie. Jeff Goldblum plays the grandmaster and is hilarious in every scene that he is in. Mark Ruffalo is surprisingly hilarious in this movie as well as Bruce Banner and the Hulk. Tessa Thompson plays valkyrie she is easily Dislikeable as first but you grow to like her throughout the movie. Idris Elba plays Heimdall he is the most badass character next to the Thor in this movie. And Karl Urban plays the Executioner he is moly used for comic relief and doesn't get a lot of screen time.Overall the best Thor movie so far can't wait to see what the next one will be like!"

12 June 2020,chubarova,7,10,10,Funny.,"Two previous films about Thor weren't good, these films were boring and dark. After changing the director to Taika Waititi, the situation turns to 180 degrees. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows another adventure of God of Thunder and his struggle with new sibling. Also this film has a lot of good jokes and twisted moments, so it cathes the viewer. Secondly, the cast is great, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are amazing, and Cate Blanchett is great as villain. Thirdly, the visual effects are wonderful, and music finishes the atmosphere of craziness.
So, it's awesome film and the best about Thor"

3 November 2017,trevor-82944,22,38,2,Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!,"Woo-hoo! Three Marvel movies in one year! Everyone's been celebrating 2017 as perhaps the best year for comic book movies in history, with every single one thus far either meeting or exceeding expectations. I understand the hype, as like the last couple of movies in the MCU, Thor: Ragnarok features lots of good comic timing thanks to director Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows) effort in staging sound to time each gag. The excitement goes nonstop as the hero fights demon after demon against screaming rock music to put the final cherry on the sundae.The continuation of the heroes' journeys will expectedly keep committed fans raising their foam fingers of approval; when we first see Thor, he is chained over lava, face to face with a fiery demon, but without a hint of fear. When he meets his evil sister, she breaks his sacred hammer, and he's later pit into a gladiator arena against a familiar green face, escalating the thrills with each new spectacle. The Incredible Hulk even has his own great moments faithful to when we last saw him, particularly in how he remained green and mean for the past two years.But that doesn't excuse Ragnarok's empty sense of humanity. The lack of consistency essentially starts with Thor's father passively dying, leaving his evil daughter to rule over Asgard, a ""sad"" moment standing as a mere plot motive with no hint of trauma. As for the Hulk, what exactly does he think about forgetting the last two years of his life? Apparently nothing, as all his self-doubt gets insultingly contradicted in his final moments on screen. A couple of other new members join Thor's team, including Valkyrie. Right upon her introduction, she falls off a platform drunk, setting off a damaged amount of sympathy for her shallowness that carries on with every other new character thrown in without consideration.For a majority of the feature, each supporting individual says their exact thoughts in service to exposition, even at the cost of satisfying closure to their stories. While I certainly learned plenty about what these new characters are, I learned little about who they are beyond funny caricatures. These characters needed to be more than comic relief against flashy colors to last longer than a month in audience's memories. The laws of physics and social order make as much sense as the humanity, appearing a little too conscious about who needs to stay alive and who needs to stay beautiful after going through chaos. As a result, too much goes on in the climax to keep everyone active.Marvel's new freak of art does nothing valuable beside combine Greek mythology with visualized techno music, two things that should never go together. As a result, the world looks uglier than ever before, even for a comic book movie, from the stupid historical paintings decorating Asgard's capital building to Hela's overdesigned ""crown"" or whatever you call it. People already care so little about ancient cultures, so once it's time for kids at school to learn about Greek history, they will think about something less valuable instead.Although I most want to talk about the acting, an overstated aspect that the entire Marvel series in actuality does dreadfully. Chris Hemsworth deserves no praise for his awful performance; he just stilts around with a charming smile plastered onto his spray-tanned face as if waiting for an awkward school photo. The film's comedic charisma has no thanks to give to him, an actor praised only because he's handsome without being annoying. But Jeff Goldblum was the absolute worst casting decision; his instantly forgettable role simply felt awkward to watch, as he created the most painful attempts at humor. I can't remember a time he has ever put on a good performance, and I wonder how he's still getting cast in big movies today.The nitpicks go on much further than you may assume: Teenage boys might complain about the fake looking graphics fit for the X-Box. Long time Marvel fans might complain about Doctor Strange's underuse in an easily rewritable four-minute scene. The more artsy viewers might complain about Hulk's dumb looking gladiator armor. The older viewers might complain about some of the seemingly never- ending jokes. Women might complain about how Hela insults middle-aged women everywhere who want representation beyond roadblocks to men's triumphs. And parents might complain about the bad role model Thor sets for younger boys. Thor's first scene alone features him playing with his hammer in its 3D glory as he beats up demons Halo style. Then for the rest of the film he joyfully beats up his siblings, celebrating his rewards afterward. So why let boys look up to some self-righteous white dude with flowing blonde hair who brags about the hardness of his hammer? If anything, Thor will raise a generation of pompous blonde-haired men who think only about claiming the throne."
5 August 2020,briancham1994,5,7,7,Bit of an oddball,"This film is an oddball in terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has a quirky style of humour that didn't really work for me.

25 October 2017,jackVSjack,53,96,8,3rd time is very much the comedy charm,"Three Thor movies, three quite different films. On this occasion, after the much lauded success of other films in the franchise like Guardians and Deadpool. (Which I love.) It is easy to see why they would choose to duplicate the comedic style.This is my favourite of the three Thor films by a clear margin. I was chuckling quite regularly from the very first scene. However I did think are they taking the balance of comedy and drama a bit too far at times. Often you feel yourself hanging on waiting to see if there is a punchline coming even in the more dramatic moments. Even when the bodies are piling up. (The Sokovia Accords have no jurisdiction in the wider universe.) For the most part the directors approach of encouraging improvisation does appear to work very well. But sometimes it does feel like there is a real lack of the ""straight man"" to add structure to the chain gun of gags.On the whole I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok. It falls into the top five of my fav Marvel movies."
22 August 2020,brianwalker23,56,82,3,Embarrassing cosplay version of Thor,"The movie originated from the comic Thor, and does a ranicd job representing the comic story lines or the mythological character. The Odin ghost scenes are cliched and against the mythology, the movie as a whole is a joke includes certain one-liners that have nothing to do with the comic either. Yet, it still fails to deliver the unique power of the main character either, its rather embarrassing."
26 October 2017,Danielpotato,176,349,1,This movie failed in every possible level.,"I'm not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie theaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with one or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in greater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with a set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who was the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to make jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole movie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with Hela. The public still barely chewed Odin's death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which should have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thor's hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both scenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not only the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work and the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonald's meal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this case Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for development and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has), instead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and because of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk continues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - what's the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a way to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller box-office and less money would went into Disney's account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a computer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything in this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes, the movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with great action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special effects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its objectives."
27 October 2017,eden-rabatsch,38,67,7,Thor is uneven but just so much fun,"This film is ridiculous.Lets get that out of the way but really any film with Thor in it let alone any of the Avengers is by definition, batshit crazy.The exception here is that Taika Waititi embraces the Crazy, he fosters it and it does pay off. Remember how bad Thor: Dark World was? Probably not, because like most traumatic incidents you have lost the memory. Where could Thor take a standalone film that was enjoyable and still maintain a link to the Avengers universe? Planet Hulk is where! The Marvel alchemists have taken numerous strands of lore and swirled them together to concoct the breathiest and most colourful confection in their short history. Guardians was funny because the characters were funny while Thor is funny because he is in on the joke.The problem then becomes one of tone. The film is peppering so many jokes and self deprecating nods that the structure becomes uneven which is most seen when the film creaks into Hero mode...you can hear the gears grinding.I am not a huge fan of Hemsworth but he is his most likable here and seems reinvigorated once that famous haircut takes place. The rest of the cast is amazing: Blanchett, Goldblum, Ruffalo, Hopkins and so on. There is just not enough time to go round. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Hela and totally absorbs the screen whenever she is on. The character is underwritten and she still wrings something memorable from it.The film looks fantastic and most especially when they save their money shots for the big battles. Waititi employs a specific colour palette at times such as the Valkyrie battle which resembles a moving Renaissance painting and it is magnificent.The big question will be whether audiences buy into Waititis' gamble. Will they laugh at the NZ accents as Korg says ""Bro"" and ""New Doug""? If they do this will be a huge hit and a shot in the arm for the extended Marvel universe."
26 October 2017,HalJorda,66,111,1,One of a Kind,"If we judge the quality of Marvel movies regarding pure entertainment, Ragnarok is easily one of the best Marvel movie yet. It is filled with Laugh Out Loud moments and stuffed with emotions. This movie also solves the villain problems of Marvel, all thanks to the brilliant performance by Cate Blanchett. This is probably best portrayal from Chris Hemsworth yet after his movie Rush. One of the biggest positives of the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved characters and new/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, I would say this is the most Marvelish movie yet. They treat everything as an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry between Hulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU. To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to finish. Audiences are going to love this movie. I hope it sustains its run when Justice League drops in the theaters."
26 July 2021,digitalbeachbum,21,42,1,This is not Thor,"The memory of collecting comics when I was a kid are ruined by these new Marvel corporate movies. I have nothing against the actors, but this is not Thor. This is an insult. Thor is a religious icon for some people. He's supposed to be a god. Can you imagine if they tried to make a movie about other religious icons? Jesus? Mohammed?"

24 January 2018,eddvh,35,49,1,If Marvel Studios did a 3 stooges movie ... this is it.,"This has got to be the worse, most disjointed Marvel movie to date. From the sublime, to the ridiculous, that kinda sums this up. Other Marvel movies have the odd one liner, like Thor's, ""He's adopted"" from the Avengers, and they where so slight, and infrequent, that the pace of the movie was never affected. Not so here, comedy, it would seem is the most important thing in this movie, and some of the jokes make the universe's mightiest heroes, appear like they are 8 year old, it really is that slapstick, the pacing of the movie dies because of it, at no point was I gripped on the edge of my seat at the action, because it was always broken up by ""Who's on first base"" comedy. The director took a gamble here, and some love it, I think it's awful, it's like Al Pacino doing comedy, it's. just. wrong. The eye candy and effects are all there, and Hella is played in a wonderful deadpan style. But the script is so full of dad jokes, it's hard for the rest of the cast get a real grip of the part they are playing, Heimdall is here, although has lost some of his gravitas that made him Heimdall, and Loki just full of .... nonsense, even by his standards.I sincerely hope the rest of the offerings from Marvel studios are better than this tripe."
29 October 2017,mt-95256,86,168,8,"Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!","After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, it's pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established itself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and comics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can be included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so far in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little bit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.Anyone who's seen director Taika Waititi's vampire-comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his Marvel entry (perhaps they've learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). It's fortunate that he kept his comedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their best films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this trend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are intended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film (and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a traditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - it's important to have fun with it!'Fun' is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesn't extend to just the laughs. Other enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well and seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. It's delightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake Infinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to the whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesn't shy away from its roots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to entertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time, her army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying towards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be proud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyder's superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.Most of this movie's joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but if we don't love the characters, we won't love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters - Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular; it's wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise full of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional, but, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be Odin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; it's nice to see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark having been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). It's a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of screen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; they're two distinct characters within each other and it's about time we get to see more of everyone's favourite rage monster.The new characters introduced in this film are all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is excellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg may not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldn't give themselves a minor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate Blanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and shoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. She's less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass and be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course there's Jeff Goldblum who's as Jeff Goldblum as he's ever been - who doesn't love that?!Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole movie's an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An excellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - let's hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence."
8 May 2020,doomedmac,5,7,8,Super fun.,This movie is a blast. It's also one of the best Marvel movies from a visual standpoint. Puts the other Thor movies to shame!
17 January 2020,jeffrowetull,5,5,10,Favorite thor movie so far,Loved it. I hope that the director does more marvel movies.
13 October 2021,phlanders-belgium,30,43,3,Read A Thor Comic Book,"And get a clue... for heaven's sake.I paid money for this.Hollywood wants to take take take and not give me anything I want. This has as much clue what Thor is as Gal gadot has who Wonder Woman is.Time to get real ""fans."""
2 November 2017,mvrk,32,58,1,Why do I want to see Loki again???,I never understood why they made Loki the main villain in the first Avengers film. He wasn't scary and didn't even die in the end. To date he's been the villain in around 4 Marvel movies and all the time the heroes think Loki will be on their side and guess what? He ends up tricking them and somehow gets away. I mean there aren't any variations to his character to provide something different. It's just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a boring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks he's doing Shakespeare. And why are they making a Thor movie look like a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I liked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. I'm not running to the theaters for this one.
16 August 2020,andrewchristianjr,6,9,8,NEW THOR.,"This film is amazing. I definitely feel like this film was a big improvement over the first two ""Thor"" films. It had a great story and it was cool how you got to see Hulk in this film. This is definitely one of my favorite films in the MCU and I would say it is the most surprising film of 2017."
25 October 2017,Colin0001,54,97,8,Laughs and action,"I saw this film at the Beckenham Odeon in London. The beginning of this film was as impactful as the bullet-time opening of Swordfish. So that set the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Hela's part in the story was as expected, and nothing changed from the trailers. She's very powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulk's treatment in the film was in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but when he was not hulk, he was a bit part player. I'm not sure I liked how his role was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of the Hulk, would have taken the shine off Thor himself. So maybe its understandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of the Hulk's character. What did make the film stand out though was the comedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along the way, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guy ever! You'll have to see for yourself, but his deadpan delivery turns the film almost into a comedy, every time he's on the screen! The battle scenes were good, but not to the level of LOTR, for scope and spectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bit short of the standard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set up the forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black Panther was not referenced)."

30 October 2017,MovieSoup,74,143,8,Good but not 10/10!!! Really!!! 10/10 is a masterpiece,"HOLD ON! before you click ""unhelpful"" let me just say that this movie is great and easily the best in the Thor trilogy however it does have flaws and that is why it is not 10/10. The comedy in this is really great and I like the overall feel of the film, there is a big difference in the plot compared to the other two that makes this film feel much more fresh and enjoyable. However there are pacing problems, some of the actors seem stilted and dull (especially the grand master).The comedy is the foundation of this movie. Whilst The Dark world was a serious mess and the plot was really dark and boring, this movie keeps it very light and playful. Honestly even in the serious scenes there is a slight comedic side that doesn't take away any of the seriousness. Waititi is a great comedic director having done some really great films such as Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do In the Shadows.He has always thrown a bit of New Zealand humor and stupidity into all his films and it really helps to lift the tone and make it a bit lighter which really works well in this film. Honestly I would really recommend his other films as they are all beautifully done. The actors who really stand out in this are Chris Hemsworth who has taken a tone shift with Thor and made him less serious and ""more realistic"" as a hero. Tom Hiddleston is great as always. He has not lost his gift of playing Loki well. The Two I really did not like and Jeff Golblum and Cate Blanchett. Goldblum plays a really dull, goofy character which would work well if Jeff Golblum could play anyone else except himself. All of the characters he plays in every movie are the same character and this takes me out of the film a lot of the time. Luckily he is not a main character thank god.Cate Blanchett plays a very boring baddie with no real personality or charisma. She is the ""goddess of DEATH"" and keeps on saying through out the movie that she is which doesn't add anything to anything. WE GET IT!!!!! you like death no can you try and have a personality. Her helmet as well is stupid as fu#k (which is just a side note of something I hated). The plot of this movie is stilted with random scenes thrown in but I still enjoyed it the story. When the plot was moving forward and the pacing was actually good then the film got a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately it was hampered by lots of ""random character"" moments. One thing I really did not like is that random characters are in this for no fu$%ing reason!! Doctor Strange is in this for 5 seconds and really does nothing to help that could not have been done by Thor or Loki. It is just a pointless scene that doesn't advance the plot and probably was a studio executive decision so that they can plug more movies.The technical side was interesting but had a little flaw. The CGI was meh with no real use other than to look pretty but that's the problem now. CGI should be used to advance the plot and not really as a ""look at this"" device. If you like CG more than plot and character development then good for you I guess.I loved the music in this, it fitted the lighter tone Waititi was going for and worked well. It is a lovely score of 80's synth that fits the space theme and tone and gives a sense of other world wonder. Honestly I hold music in high regard in film and this is one of the better fitting soundtracks that Marvel have done. It's mostly all score as well with only one Rock song being used to great effect in the fight scenes. The colour palet of this movie is more vibrant than the last two films as well. More neon and less dark colours make this film a lot more enjoyable to watch visually speaking. This goes hand in hand with the music and the cinematography to create something which is really good and different from most of Marvels movies. Overall this film is really good and I did enjoy it, however it was in the end another marvel movie with a few small changes and a great jokes. In a world where we have TONS of superhero films I just want one that breaks the mold and does something different from the norm. The last one to do that was Logan and I wish Thor Ragnarok had done more to fight against the Marvel plot conventions."
1 January 2019,vithiet,6,9,10,Everything a superhero movie should be!,"This movie has it all: fun, funny, visually impressive and with plenty of originality throughout. Taika Waititi did an amazing job giving a new angle to the genre, which definitely helped shape the tone of subsequent superhero movies, for the better. Also the throwback to 1970s Jack Kirby aesthetics was a fantastic touch! Take notes Hollywood: this is what a fun blockbuster should be!"
2 November 2017,Sarge2020,336,671,1,Disappointing goofball comedy,"This is a goofball comedy, that contains high campery and pantomime villains, endless cheesy jokes at the expense of any real character or story development in place of any type of gravitas and epicness-ITS PERFECT.I personally don't like it and think it is a step in the wrong direction...."
2 June 2018,Fifth_of_November,22,35,1,"Yes, critics are sold to Disney/Marvel","Epic insult to Thor as a character and his whole universe. Absolute trash of a movie. Enough has been said about the endless teenager jokes preventing any sense of seriousness at any moment. The script is as hollow as space.If you ever wanted to see a superhero movie without a vilain, this is one. Hela has like 5 minutes on screen over this 130 minutes comedy show. Her minutes are not that interesting as her character's mimics are almost grotesque.Loki has been turned into the funny idiot for (more) comic relief. He's just a God after all but gets beaten up by some 5'2'' Valkyrie. He takes the hits and almost apologizes for being there. This is the God of Mischief here and you would expect to feel some cause for concern when he's around, but Disney/Marvel and their paid critics have decided that this was not an issue at all.And that Valkyrie... this has to be the most annoying character created by Hollywood since Jar Jar Binks. She's about 5'2'' but can punch guys like Arnold did in the 80's. Oh and they had to make her drink like a guy too. So yes, another superhero female character introduced in a movie with no other point than being a female superhero. Each movie has hers now, it seems like a rule. Yes we know, politics want movies to balance out against all that maleness of the past and push the idea that females can save humankind. Btw, did you ever thought about the fact that the strongest man in the world can probably toss around and punch away average guys? While the strongest female in the world can't because of PHYSICS? By bowing to politics, these idiots in the studios have removed physics from action movies. STOP IT. YOU ARE KILLING MOVIES.I'll stop there. Avoid this crap. If you are unlucky enough to see it and you are not sure you liked it or not because after all, all the critics said it was good and maybe you missed something, remember at that point that no, you did not miss anything, it was BAD and designed for very immature audiences. People over 18 who think this movie was good should be removed their right to vote at elections."
25 November 2017,ceejay-cj,355,683,2,Marvel has gone totally Monty Python level silly.,"Utter comedic crap, nothing like the comics anymore. Marvel has just given up and turned all their best dramatic stories into action comedies that have more in common with Monty Python than the source material that originally put them on the map. Watch any episode of Vikings on TV and wonder how these Asgardians were supposed to be their gods!We now reached an era of audience acceptance of anything stupid so long as its funny, drama is too challenging for them so everything has to be regressed down to yet another silly comedy to make any money. No wonder Blade Runner 2049 can't make a buck at the box office, people have literally been nurtured to only be entertained by the dumbest level of entertainment they can get that doesn't tax them while eating popcorn and scrolling through their phones."

But damn it was awesome to be blown away like that.For anyone who might not have loved the first two Thor movies, should not let them keep you from seeing this one.It's so utterly different, colorful and funny, it's like Avengers/Guardians mixed together.There was several truly epic scenes, and lot's of awesome action scenes throughout the movie, with lots of humour and soul to it.The story worked well, without trying to be complicated, but enough twist here and there to keep the movie from feeling transparent.If you are looking for a funny and very entertaining movie, Thor Ragnorock won't disappoint at all.Very likely to rank as the best MCU movie yet."

21 June 2020,yls-32055,7,9,8,Thor: Ragnarok,"Since the superhero movie was made, special effects and stars are almost no problem. They can match the routines the target audience wants to see, and they will still sell no matter how they are repeated. Action Rhythm and excessive details are a psychological game with the audience. If the commercial elements are well distributed, the plot will have a sense of seamless connection. Just like this Thor, it is also the most appropriate atmosphere for the climax of the recent action movie."
7 June 2020,dilipbts,7,11,9,Thor Ragnarok,Thor Ragnarok is an amazing weird well made and action parked movie. Ragnarok is definite the best Thor movie to date. The whole atmosphere of the movie is is wacky and weird but with the same Marvel feel we all love. The characters new and old really shine along with the locations and sets. The villain Hela is also great in the movie and recreation rally adds to movie as a whole whole also adding to list list of great casting choices by Marvel. To summarize Thor Ragnarok is Marvel's best Thor movie to date with its dry humour and its weird and wacky tones.
24 July 2018,Jackbv123,9,16,4,Pathetic when you have to resort to destroying things to make a movie,"My most lasting impression is of this movie is Hela heaping destruction and death on all she could touch. Overall, that part was tasteless and crude.A good story establishes premises or rules and works within them. Usually, there will be one or two new additions or changes along the way to provide a plot twist. When done well, the twist is foreshadowed. The Marvel series of which Thor is a big part has established these rules. Thor and Odin are godlike creatures, if not immortal ones. Thor's hammer is indestructible. But within a very short period at the beginning of this movie, countless of these rules were abolished or changed. Odin dies. Thor's hammer is destroyed. Hela is unstoppable even by an army of godlike Asgardians. Thor is enslaved through a device that controls him via pain. In other words, virtually everything we have come to know about Asgard and its people is rewritten. And Hela appears to have no rules governing her whatsoever in terms of what she can do.Then to make matters worse, the rules change and the indestructible Hela becomes beatable.The plot is weak because the movie relies heavily on fight sequences and sophomoric humor. Often times the humor interrupts the flow of the movie. Hulk is a disappointment.As is often the case with PG-13, there is much crude innuendo."

If I had any complaints at all which is not a big deal I thought Tessa Thompson should not be in the film. Feels more like a miscast, has a big part of the film, and cheesy. I think someone else could of done a way better job but it's not a big deal."

27 October 2017,jshoesmithkr,39,68,10,Best Film I've seen yet!,"The film started off with more than I expected. A few issues I did notice was that several trailer bits were cut out of the film. The three warriors could have had a bit more to do before dying. Sif should have been in the film as a hero but as long as Marvel still use her. The new characters Korg, Skurge, Hela and Valkryie were very interesting. Another clever thing the film did was put the Doctor Strange post credit scene into the film which was quite clever. This film was way better than the first Avengers. A lot of the films are better than Avengers but people just don't get that. Ultron was better, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 should be rated higher than Avengers so I expect any true fans to rate Thor Ragnarok higher.It deserves 10 or 9 but certainly no lower than 8. Avengers Infinity War I fear may ruin the ending for this film, especially if all the surviving Asgardians are killed by Thanos like the Infinity War trailer showed.Loki and Thor did some funny things like the ""get help"" thing. Bruce Banner remained as Hulk for two years is a bit bizarre. If he does now permanently stay as Hulk then it suggests that his actor is quitting. Korg and Heimdall need to return some day for more action. Now that you know some viewpoints, go and watch this. You'll definitely be pleased if you do."

30 November 2017,qeter,10,16,5,Loosing gravity,"Okay. The inspiration was Ragnarok, the old saga of the dying northern gods. Added are some jokes and a different outcome to get a happy end. As a long time comic reader a very disappointing experience. But I guess, for people who have grown up with Star Wars, the Hobbits and King of Thrones this new Thor movie checks all the boxes. A mixed bag of fantasy, science fiction, jokes and action. And inner struggles are shown in a populist easily accessible way. But for movies like this there are no established comic heroes needed. Make such a script for a pure fantasy movie, so I know, I don't have to go for it. Fantasy is a colorful, conservative told tale without any vision. It does not add anything to its characters that may ring a bell in me or gives anything in meaning to my life. Pure entertainment. But from my comic heroes I am used that they mirror my own struggles in life. The uncertainties, the trying of love, the trying of being a good one, all the lost hopes, and the regaining of hope. The longing for being alone, the longing to be together with others. The best comic super hero tales bring me to tears. Give new insight. Let me struggle further in my own life. But this Thor is just fantasy. Boring entertainment. Action happens, and after that another one. And then it's over. I have seen Justice League the day before. Justice League went wrong. The script did not work out. But at least they tried. The characters (Batman, Superman) did not overcome their own gravity, could not get disconnected from their history in comics. Justice League failed, because the script was torn apart in its aim to get something right. But still, that is the essence of being human, too. To try and to fail. That bound my feeling for the failing of Justice League. That is something. But Thor did nothing with me. Absolutely nothing."
28 October 2017,TheSecondMan,42,74,7,Thor Review,"Thor: Ragnarok is a fun and entertaining movie. The acting is great along with the comedy. The tone and feel Taika Waititi has created fits so well with Thor and completely embraces the ridiculousness of the Thor setting. The movie perhaps gets too silly at some points, but for the most part the comedy is spot on. A strong 7/10"
27 October 2017,Charicific,32,55,7,Thor-tastic,"Thor Ragnarok is a fun and entertaining film. Reminded me a lot of Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Great performances from Tessa Thompson, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth as per usual. Seems to be more of a fan-based movie as opposed to telling more of the infinity stone sub-plot that runs through some of the other movies. Worth the watch!"
26 December 2020,jamesal1978,75,115,2,Marvel/Disney Destroying The Superhero genre,"All the weekly release of superhero films has diluted the quality. Disney destroyed Star Wars and now the superheroes have gone Hallmark TV quality. Every single woman is brilliant, smart and kick ass and the god of thunder is cracking jokes and being fooled left, right and center.
For whatever reason Disney forgets that we men like feminine women and real men."
29 April 2021,sauravjoshi85,8,14,9,A perfect Entertainer,"Thor: Ragnarok is an action, adventure, Sci-fi super hero movie directed by Taika Waititi and stars Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban and Anthony Hopkins.This movie is 17th movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is probably one of the finest Marvel superhero movie with lot's of action, great CGIs, funny one liners and a well timed humour. This is what you called a perfect all round entertainer.One thing which I have seen in most of the marvel movies is the predictable storyline and same is the case with this movie but I must say that Watiti deserves an applause for turning this cliche into a fun joyride. As soon as the movie starts with Hemsworth in the cage delivering a funny dialogue you will realize that you are into a different Marvel movies.Acting is superb and credit should be given to all the characters for doing a superb job, screenplay of the movie is fast paced and has the pinch of funny one liners and humour in between. Action scenes are amazing and so as cinematography. The use of CGI has reached to another level and is been wonderful.This is one of the greatest Marvel movie and can be called as the perfect entertainer. A must watch."
8 November 2017,matthewssilverhammer,11,21,8,Another MCU Success,"Ragnarok is the third in the Thor franchise. It is the sixth film featuring Hemsworth as the God of Thunder. It is the 17th entry in the behemoth known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the third one just this year. This game-changing series has been plugging along for almost ten years, with very few misses among their many hits. So what can I say new about Ragnarok? It's colorful, funny, epic, appropriately intimate, full of cameos and great performances, and way more entertaining than it is original. In other words, it's a fairly standard but similarly great Marvel movie. In it, Thor has to escape a gladiatorial planet with Hulk and Loki in order to save Asgard from being destroyed by limitlessly powerful new villainess Hela (Blanchett). In scope and plot, it's fairly common. However, there's so much goodness in the smaller stuff that makes the movie standout. Goldblum is wonderfully sleazy and charmingly despicable. The hang-out sessions with Hulk and Thor are great, like two petulant children fighting over who is cooler. The music is great, especially the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". And each time the movie underhands superhero posturing with a needed comedic beat, I wanted to cheer but couldn't from laughing. So the movie is obviously a blast, but reviewing it is difficult for me. It's almost like having to review a single episode of a TV show. Luckily, the MCU is a TV show I love, and Ragnarok fits quite nicely within the quality of the larger universe. Even with its messiness and familiarity, Marvel has given us (yet another) undeniably fun foray into their expansive creation."
8 November 2017,aciessi,10,18,7,"Valhalla, I'm Coming!","Marvel, how do you do it? You make movies that this superhero/comic book illiterate will go see. Not only that, but you made a Thor movie that really got my attention in the coming attractions. I used to think Thor was one of the more serious and boring Marvel films. I once caught the first film on a flight home somewhere and I totally slept through it. Well, out of nowhere comes Ragnarok, which injects serious comedic energy through the veins of the franchise. This is a goofy, funny little acting flick. Not so different from Guardians of the Galaxy, in fact. It takes itself so lightly and I was thrilled to see that. Comic book movies shouldn't be so gritty. Thor and Hulk romp on the screen like a reboot of Lethal Weapon. Jeff Goldblum is here and he's fantastic... as Jeff Goldblum. Let's face it, we wouldn't want him any other way. Cate Blanchett is dynamite. The beauty of this, as with most Marvel movies is that you will have a great time, regardless if you're familiar with the comic books or not."
6 November 2017,Movie_Muse_Reviews,11,21,8,"Marvel goes full comedy with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and it's a blast","The hugely successful Marvel Cinematic Universe has continued to inch further and further into comedic territory in recent years; with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" it completely passes through the comic threshold. With its laughs-first approach, from start to finish ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is Marvel Studios' funniest film. The comedic instincts of director Taika Waititi (""What We Do in the Shadows,"" ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"") far surpasses those of the directors of the nearly 20 previous Marvel movies. He knows how to get the extra, unexpected laugh; every time the film is funny for overt comedy writing reasons, there's another sneakier layer of humor working in other hilarious surprises.Although the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies made the first claim to be Marvel's comedy-inclined franchise, humor has always been a core element of the ""Thor"" films as well. Star Chris Hemsworth's knack for comedy has been the most consistently enjoyable element of the ""Thor"" solo films, though the previous two were surprisingly reticent to embrace it. ""Ragnarok,"" on the other hand, gives it a Hulk-sized hug.After a prologue in which Thor squares off with the fire demon Surtur (Clancy Brown) to prevent Ragnarok, the prophecy that would see Surtur use the Eternal Flame to destroy Asgard, he returns home to find things amiss thanks to his mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The brothers soon discover that their previously unknown and extremely powerful older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), is set to make her claim to the throne – and all the realms. In their initial attempts to stop her, Thor and Loki end up stranded on Sakaar, a planet of misfits and detritus ruled by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), from which they must escape with the help of friends new and old.Laughs drive ""Ragnarok,"" but the plot mechanics do not sour the overall joyride as has been the case with many superhero films of late, including some of Marvel's. Writer Eric Pearson, with Craig Kyle and ""Thor: The Dark World's"" Christopher Yost, manage to create a true hero's journey and a sense of stakes. As silly as ""Ragnarok"" gets, it never loses its grounding, unlike its still-good but more reckless recent Marvel Universe predecessor, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.""Abundantly clear is the way Marvel applied the successes of ""Guardians"" to ""Thor"" (if the use of a '70s rock song weren't obvious enough). The film has a similar aesthetic, especially in all the Sakaar scenes, and an almost parallel assortment of characters. Aside from the obvious similarities between Thor and Quill, you have a no-nonsense woman like Gamora in Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie – and awfully similar to Drax is the talking Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's not a bad model to draw from, but the almost Shakespearian elements of ""Thor"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" have disappeared as a result, instead replaced by Waititi's playful spirit.The MCU has yet to be truly influenced by an auteur – in fact, it's lost some (e.g. Edgar Wright on ""Ant-Man"") – so fans of these movies that are bigger fans of film in general will be really pleased at how visible Waititi's fingerprints are on this project. Some of the comedic touches are distinctively his, or at least a touch more clever than the Marvel norm, and he brings some of his usual lackeys to the cast (including his own voice talents as the gentle brute Korg). Every actor in the film is in step with Waititi's vision and comic tone, though certainly some are better with it than others. If nothing else, ""Ragnarok"" is great proof of what can happen when unique filmmakers and major studio machines play well together.Another subtle element of ""Ragnarok"" that works well is pacing. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, it's the longest ""Thor"" movie and up there with most of the long Marvel movies, but it doesn't drag. There is a real comfortable trajectory to the story, and whereas most of these large-scale blockbusters with multiple plot lines feel disjointed and consequently slow, the transitions in ""Ragnarok"" come with little cliffhangers of suspense that sometimes even leave room for imagination. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" doesn't leave a ton of room for pathos – it's not emotionally resonant in the way many Marvel films have been, but it can hold its own against the rest of the MCU library in terms of humor and entertainment value. Maybe Marvel once believed ""Thor"" could be more dramatic, and there's something sad about giving up on that vision, but sometimes you just have to do what you do best, and at this point for Marvel Studios, hilarious big-scale adventure is where they're excelling.~Steven CThanks for reading!

8 November 2017,autisticreviewers,11,19,8,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"With Marvel having succeeded with the 2nd installment of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and managing to bring back Spider-Man in 'Homecoming', their third and final release for 2017 succeeds with making Thor: Ragnarok a true Thor film and somehow managing to make it as fun and hilarious as possible.What makes this film close to perfect is the direction and vision of acclaimed New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (which marks this as his first Hollywood feature and biggest project to have worked on), what he brings here is a big dose of humour that consists of witty dialogue, visually appealing world design and characters to actually care for (with our leading hero being as bold, his side allies being as helpful and a villain that literally is a true form of evil). It somehow manages to beat over the first two films in terms of fun and scale, though they were big budgeted productions but here Waititi is given plenty of space for his touches to make it unique, similarly enough it has the tones that made Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 great.Casting range here is on point; Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban and a few more giving solid performances for the entire film. The visual effects are greatly used to a high point and of course the humour plays a bigger role here that makes it so much fun, and music as well is used to a high point of greatness. Only fault is that with the humour being so consistent throughout, there isn't as much emotional investment with some of the characters so it does miss a mark slightly but the fun tone makes up for it.Thor: Ragnarok delivers to audiences awesome comic book fun with mixing an overdose of humour, epic scale production value, dazzling action set pieces and solid performances from the cast overall. Marvel ends their release schedule for 2017 with a bang and delivering a Thor movie that I can say personally is a true 'Thor' movie while setting up more to lead up of next year's Infinity War.4/5 - Nick 3.5/5 - Jay -The Autistic Reviewers."

                        ",Not for Thor Fans... or Anyone over 10,"I had the opportunity to witness this goofy nonsense with my Father, who was a big fan of the Thor comics in his youth, and what he saw on screen destroyed everything he, and later, I, would come to enjoy about the titular character, who has been reduced to a comedic buffoon thanks to this, as my Father would say, ""abortion"". And indeed it was. The constant jokes, which fall flat in the hands of Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett, who seem to have swapped genders in this film, caused the story to lose its stakes, rendering the 2hr 10min movie a complete waste. Don't see this if you're a Thor fan."
26 September 2020,greeniebrow,6,7,10,Ragnarok,"By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride.Best of the Thors and top 3 of the Marvel universe."

1 November 2017,mynban,47,84,8,80s Style Action,"I will keep it brief; this movie was akin to some cult action/superhero movies from 80s like Flash Gordon with the pace, kind of imagery it had, the balance of action/interaction in a humour loaded format, choice of tracks in OST and the way said music is capitalized in the movie.I am a middle aged person who loved Flash Gordon back in days and Ragnarok was almost a nostalgic experience for me. I enjoyed most choices in the movie even the ones that are most criticized such as easy discarding of Fandrall and Volstagg. For me those simply were used as highlighters of how Hela is in a league of her own that's simply beyond challenge. The ease they let people perish (akin to hawkmen charge in Flash Gordon) along disco music was also one of the factors where I enjoyed that nostalgic fan ride."
17 November 2017,bogdan314,152,290,1,Worst piece of cinema trash I've seen in awhile,"So this movie has an 8.2 on IMDb right now. If this movie would be listed as ""superhero parody"", then I would give it a 7. But this is not supposed to be a parody, it's supposed to be an action movie, with a script that makes some sense, with characters that should be a little believable.Nothing makes sense in this movie. Characters are complete trash - the movie revolves around goofy humor lines. I do admit that some of the jokes are good, but the whole movie itself is a joke. It almost breaks the 4th wall with out-of-universe jokes.I have seen some bad movies before, but this is the first time I walked out of the cinema in the middle of the movie (1 hour in).So people are trashing Batman v Superman because of some plot holes and gory visuals, but they applaud this as a masterpiece. OK..."
6 November 2017,pinkled5,12,20,7,Tries too Hard but it's Still Fun,"There's a lot to like about Thor Ragnarok. Naturally, everyone's talking about the heavy dose of comedic elements, but I found that 80% of the jokes felt forced and unfunny, and 10% were misplaced. However, there were few groaners or eye-rollers so it was OK. I did like the tone of the movie, though, and Chris Hemsworth's comedy chops are quite impressive. It was nice to see him work with such diverse material. The plot wasn't great, but it was good enough.My favorite parts of this movie were the interactions between Thor and Loki. That's such an interesting relationship and I'm glad they gave it some screen time here. Characters like Loki I find very interesting, that is, anti-heroes with complex motivations.Everything else was pretty good, not super great, but good enough. I can recommend it."
27 October 2017,djs-specs,35,60,9,A great romp!,"I've been rather tepid towards the MCU since the get-go. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed individual films but I've never really been hanging out for the next installment. However, the previews for this one did pique my interest so when I was invited to go see it by some friends I decided to make the effort (rather than waiting for it on Foxtel like I have for the last few).I'm glad I went.The best word for this film really is 'romp'. Its fun, its energetic and its often hilarious to watch. Its a complete tone change from the previous two Thor movies - the second in particular - and its all the better for it. While its a shame that some familiar characters couldn't make an appearance, and some did only briefly, I don't think the movie suffers horribly for their absence. The story holds together pretty well, in my opinion, and I didn't notice any glaring plot holes.Kudos to everyone involved in this film, especially director Taika Waititi. I had a lot of fun watching it and I hope that other people will too."
8 November 2017,Hellmant,11,22,9,The 80s kind of 'FLASH GORDON' style of the movie is cool too!,"'THOR: RAGNAROK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third film in the popular Marvel Studios comic book movie franchise, and the 17th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This sequel has Thor teaming up with Hulk, in order to escape a garbage planet and return to Asgard in time to rescue it from the upcoming Ragnarok. The movie was directed by Taika Waititi (who's also helmed the indie comedy hits 'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS' and 'HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE'), and it was written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost. The film stars Chris Hemsworth (reprising his most iconic role), Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins. It's received some of the best reviews ever for a Marvel Studios film, and it's also another huge hit at the Box Office as well. I really enjoyed it too. Thor (Hemsworth) has been looking for the Infinity Stones for over 2 years now, and he's imprisoned by a fire demon, called Surtur, while doing so. Surtur informs Thor that his father Odin (Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard, and that the planet will soon be destroyed by the prophecy Ragnarok. Thor defeats Surtur and returns to Asgard, only to find his brother Loki (Hiddleston) posing as Odin. Thor then forces Loki to go with him to Norway, on Earth, and find their father. Odin informs Thor and Loki that he's dying, and that their sister Hela (Blanchett) will be able to escape her imprisonment once he's dead, and return to take over Asgard. While trying to stop Hela, Thor and Loki crash land on a garbage planet, called Sakaar. There Thor finds Hulk (Ruffalo), who has been stuck as the green monster for over two years now. Thor then attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard. This Thor film is more of a comedy than anything else. I think it's a very fitting genre for this character though, and the film is very effectively done this way. Waititi has already proved himself a great comedic director, with his other feature films, and he doesn't disappoint here. The 80s kind of 'FLASH GORDON' style of the movie is cool too, and the performances are all more than decent. It's perhaps just a little too long though, and slow in some places. It's also not as exciting of an action film as well, compared to other recent superhero flicks, because of all the comedy. It is a lot of fun though, and more than worth seeing."
28 March 2020,yuzou-45815,4,5,8,good,"One star gave me a short-acting hammer that reached its peak, almost giving me a physiological response on the spot; one star gave Blanchett a foot-buckling show; one star gave a few retro and very powerful electronic soundtracks. Everything else is Marvel-style stupid. Routines are full of entertainment and almost forget them after leaving the cinema."
23 April 2022,rudicantfail,2,2,8,Enjoyable,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" was not what I was expecting. These Marvel movies have been a bit ""ify"" to say the least, but I actually quite enjoyed this film. Perhaps it was the silly storyline, but it was certainly more laid back, and had a good quantity of humour which made it so entertaining. Some of the special effects were fantastic, whilst some of the costumes were quite garish and perhaps gaudy. But all in all, this was a good movie to watch; to sit back with a glass of wine, and enjoy."

Ragnarok is a movie that i had a feeling would happen eventually, I read about this place in the comics and I knew it would make a great film.Massive Thor fan so I knew without seeing a trailer this would be a fantastic watch, I have 2 thor hammers so its safe to see I'm a Marvel nut. Incredible peformances from not only Hemsworth but literally everyone that was involved did a electrifying peformance.Highly recommend, thats right, im calling all Thor fans to continue this spectacular journey with yours truly the God Of Thunder."
6 November 2017,rannynm,10,19,9,Excellent action and style. Great acting and direction. Captures details with an 80s retro feel,"Thor: Ragnarok impressed me because of its excellent action and style. The acting is top level and the wonderful direction captures every detail with an 80s retro feel. This is sure to be a crowd-pleaser for all Marvel fans.The story is about Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder and former Avenger, who finds himself in the toughest match of his life when he is pitted against Hela (Cate Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who destroys his hammer in a fierce battle. Thor escapes through a space portal, but is transported to Sakaar, a planet known for its gladiator matches hosted by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Imprisoned, Thor is forced to fight on the gladiator ring, only to find out his opponent is the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who is unaware of their previous comradery. Meanwhile on Asgard, Hela is the new leader and executes a strict dictatorship. Despite being captured, Thor is trying to set up a team with the Hulk, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape and stop Hela before it is too late.Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, excellently presents his desperation, despite being a hero of great power. His new-born comradery with the Hulk is well presented, due to their great chemistry. Cate Blanchett, as Hela, is one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, due to her nefarious behavior and interesting backstory that shines a new light on Asgard's history. Mark Ruffalo, as the Hulk, is excellent in his Jekyll-Hyde personality between being Bruce Banner and being the Hulk. Due to this, he is my favorite character in the movie. Jeff Goldblum, as the Grandmaster, is quirky and fun like always. Tessa Thompson, as Valkyrie, provides an initially flawed companion to Thor, but stops running away from her problems and face them, when she decides to team up with Thor. Tom Hiddleston, as Loki, is as deceptive and charismatic as ever.The direction by Taika Waititi is splendid. Every scene in the movie is filled with style and well-timed comedy. My favorite scene is when Thor activates his true potential in the final battle against Hela because it is a huge leap for the character, and it leads to one of the most epic battles in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. My only problem with the movie is the tonal shifts the movie faces because the movie is filled with comedic scenes. However, in serious and emotional scenes, they feel rout of place. The message of the movie is about believing in yourself. Thor is only able to last in the battle with Hela when he realizes his true potential is beyond his hammer. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 because of its intense action and suggestive references. Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

6 November 2017,jon.h.ochiai,11,21,9,"Thor gets it right in ""Ragnarok""","""Thor: Ragnarok"" rocks as the best ""Thor"". Chris Hemsworth is hysterical and heroic as the God of Thunder in Director Taika Waititi's ""Ragnarok"" which refers to the Norse mythology's End of Days. This is the delightful narrative recreation in the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost. Yet as whimsical as the movie becomes with Thor battling his Avengers mate The Hulk in the gladiator arena on planet Sakaar saying ""Yes! We know each other. He's a friend from work!"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"" underlines hero and family. Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins are both funny and poignant in that capacity.Hopkins returns as Norse god Odin. His first born daughter Hela, Goddess of Death, regally malevolent Cate Blanchett, returns from Odin's banishment in vengeance imposing Ragnarok upon Asgard. In the touching scene in Norway, Odin tells his warring prodigal sons Thor and Loki, charismatic Tom Hiddleston, ""I love you."" While escaping from Sakaar, Thor tells Loki he thought growing up that they would ""fight side by side forever"". That was not to be. Loki is who he is.With the impending conflict with his sister the Goddess of Death, Thor seeks out Odin in the realm of dreams. Thor says, ""I am not as strong as you!"" Odin reminds, ""No, you're stronger."" Waititi pokes fun and creates amazing visuals of distant worlds, but never forgets what moves are heroes and love. In his recurrent theme, Thor says, ""Because that's what heroes do."" ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may make you laugh out loud in irreverence as Thor and Hulk talk about being ""hotheads"". Yet, ""Ragnarok"" is about reclaiming one's greatness and family. Chris Hemsworth is awesome. He looks like a Norse god: handsome, chiseled body, and with his long blonde locks shorn. He has great comedic timing and delivery. His Thor reveals as self-deprecating, funny and humbled by circumstance. Hemsworth's Hero emerges in his vulnerability. This comical saga of good and evil compels with Cate Blanchett, who is formidable evil power in Hela. Blanchett is beautiful in sleek wardrobe, antlered helmet, onyx mane, and Goth eyes. Cate restrains from total camp by harnessing some of Hela's fury within. Hela was the merciless warrior in Odin's bloody wars that united the ""8 Realms"". She embraced her darkness which resulted in her exile as Odin reinvented peace for Asgard. Blanchett brilliantly nuances Hela's rage and betrayal. She easily disposes hundreds of Asgard warriors. She even shatters Thor's Might Hammer like glass, as seen in movie trailers. Thor may not be strong enough to defeat Hela's great evil. In silly convoluted fashion Thor and Loki end up captive on the planet Sakaar, the kingdom of the Grandmaster, played by goofy in a good way Jeff Goldblum, as the self-styled Emperor Nero. Thor becomes the Grandmaster's gladiator challenging his champion, the Hulk and his human persona David Banner, played by genius straight man Mark Ruffalo. Thor and Hulk discover the unexpected ally in surviving warrior Valkyrie, strong smart Tessa Thompson. The Valkyrie are the women warrior protectors of Asgard in Norse mythology. Perhaps, the romantic interest for Thor, Thompson is fun and total kick ass. Eventually, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" reverts to its superhero DNA. Though it is a wild fun ride with a lot of laughs and welcome poignant turns. Thor does what heroes do—fight against great evil not knowing whether good will prevail. The good man or god in this case fights on as opposed to doing nothing in the face of evil. Hemsworth and Blanchett lend gravitas to Director Waittit's whimsical take on the classic battle of good and evil in the universe where heroes and family count. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is great fun."
1 September 2020,haydenluz,6,9,7,Thor: Ragnarok,"Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, created this breath of fresh air, being undoubtedly, the best installment to the Thor series. You can tell that Taika had a great respect and bond with the returning cast members, seamlessly working together on this exciting tale. Waititi did an amazing job adapting his multi-genre style into this film, but the fact that he tried to keep it in continuity with the Marvel style, it didn't really fit all that well; If Waititi made this film with strictly his style, it would've paid off better, grasping what made Guardians of the Galaxy a great film.Even though Waititi played things a little safe, while the premise is overused and predictable, he brilliantly switched up the whole narrative, doing his best to make this an original and entertaining film. Thor: Ragnarok, was so much fun, while really embracing the weirdness the saga poses. The film flows at such a brisk pace, that can be laidback at times, while having so many memorable moments. Waititi created this film to be more of a comedy-based film, but the other darker tones he incorporated worked pretty well, although some of the dramatic scenes were played off a little light.Thor: Ragnarok stands out so much because of the characters! Sarah Finn did another amazing job casting this huge talent! You can genuinely tell that everyone was having a good time, which translates to great performances across the board! Chris Hemsworth is a stud! He brings so much wit, humor, and heart to the Thor character, being able to create chemistry with anyone! The writers gave him everything he needed to make his character more likable, while giving him some nice character development. We finally get to see Mark Ruffalo back in action as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in! Ruffalo was born to play this character! He brings a tremendous likability to the character, bringing so much wit, and subtle humor, to give his character more great layers! Ruffalo can fit any scheme that he's thrown into, being such an enjoyable presence everytime. Tessa Thompson gets thrown into the MCU mix, and she is another one that fits the scheme like a glove! She is such a fantastic addition to the saga, while putting on such a natural performance, here. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he doesn't have too much to do in the film, because of his antics in the past. Believe it or not, he is more mellowed out, and grounded this time around, also having some nice character development. One of the most favorable additions to the film, was Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi. He didn't have much to do up until the end of the third act, but he was just an enjoyable presence, having some great jokes along the way! Karl Urban as Skurge, was fine, but he wasn't one of those characters that needed to be there, especially due to the fact that he's just a jerk. Urban definitely made the best out of his screen time, having a few decent moments, but he isn't the most memorable out of the cast. You probably wouldn't expect to see Jeff Goldblum in the MCU, but him as The GrandMaster was awesome! The way his character was written was perfect for the tone of the film! Even though he didn't have a whole lot of screen time, he made the absolute most of it! Cate Blanchett may have overcooked her performance a tad, but she was still great as Hela. She is one of the better villains of the MCU, having a good motive, and connection to Thor and Loki. One of my only issues with Hela, she could've been fleshed out better, instead of throwing a lot of exposition at us. There is a lot to be explored about her character, so it's understandable to an extent, but it left her character to be a little boring, at times.The screenplay by Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost, and Eric Pearson, had a lot of good pieces of writting, with a great flow and timing, but some of the dramatic aspects were cut a little thin, due to the comedy-heavy genre. The film would've benefited if they would've cut back on the comedy just a little bit, to tighten up the emotional and dramatic aspects; other than that, there isn't much to complain about.The production of this film was gorgeous! There were so many beautiful colors, with unique world designs. The effects of the film weren't the best it could've been, but it worked a lot better than something like Black Panther. The action of the film was one of the best aspects, being well balanced, well shot, and really entertaining! The score and soundtrack wasn't the orthodox score from the MCU films; Waititi and Mark Mothersbaugh incorporated this rock anthem, and it just worked perfectly!Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is one of my personal favorite MCU films. Even though this blast of fun comes with issues, Thor: Ragnarok belongs close to the top of your list!"
28 October 2017,pramsalim,41,74,10,The God of Thunder-ous Laughter.,"Let me get this out of my system, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most fun I had at the movies in 2017. It's one of those movies that had everything. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Amazing VFX? Check. Hulk being a God-smashing maniac? Double-check. This is definitely the best out of the Thor series. The two previous ones were just generic superhero movies. They weren't bad, they were pretty good. But as soon as you left the theater, you won't be thinking about it anymore.This one, however, wasn't generic. It was different. We were used to seeing Thor as this almighty God with a hammer that nobody can lift. And that's pretty much it. To be honest, I never cared much about Thor. He just wasn't that interesting. But this movie drew sort of a parody of his image and it was really fun to watch. And let's not forget about the Hulk. He is so lovable in this movie. How do you even make a person want to cuddle a 10-foot green abomination? You got to be a genius or some kind. Marvel appointed Taika Waititi to direct this movie. An indie darling from New Zealand that made comedy hits like What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark, and most recently, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople. They all have this unique dry humor that I adore very much. And he brought his signature style again for this movie. I respect this move by Marvel because a lot of studios are afraid of trying new things. A lot of directors were left with minimal creative decisions when it comes to big blockbusters. One of the case was the Fantastic Four reboot by Fox, two years ago. Josh Trank was so frustrated at Fox's dominating involvement in his project that he eventually took his frustration to the social media. Marvel don't want this to happen. They bravely take the risk of giving directors creative decisions. Though sometimes it could result to a mixed bag like Iron Man 3, it could also be a smashing hit like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.In the end, this movie is a total blast from start to end. It may be different than the other Marvel movies, but I swear there is nothing to regret. Whatever this movie lacks in dramatic aspects, it makes up in its comedy and fun characters along the way. And by today, I know that Thor isn't on my Top 2 Most Boring Avenger list anymore. Though Hawkeye is definitely still there. Make the poor guy relevant Marvel, jeez."

                        ",Thor:Ragnarok example why Marvel outclasses DC over and Over,"Superb Experience and characters to make even a non fanboy geek out on them totally. While DC have destroyed classic concepts and Characters by employing c-grade writers both in comics (JL:Gods among Us) and movies (Batman Vs Superman, a wasted opportunity) while time and again Marvel really produce one roller-coaster after another.The way they create old stories with new addition and mix up and slowly present awesome surprising characters to create new story-line to enjoy is just unbelievable. I hope they will keep entertaining us. Kudos Marvel Team."
9 May 2022,D4V1D2411,2,2,9,"Good things are so good, they make me forget about the things I hate","I really like this movie despite me knowing I should probably hate it. My main problems with this movie is how it feels a lot of the time. I feel like non of the characters are taking the stakes and the plot too seriously and thats why theyre joking around all the time, and even in the worse moments, and since I really liked more the thor from the first movie, I kida prefer that he was more serious. But the movie manages to make me forget about those problems by being really really funny. Most of the jokes still work for me and still make me laugh and despite me disliking the vibe, at certain points it is actually taken seriously and those are my favourite moments. The villain is one of my favourites from marvel movies and I would have liked to see more of her. I would consider this movie perfect if it wasnt for me prefering a more serious tone but, still, Its a super fun, exciting and thrilling movie."
13 June 2020,ylings-45181,6,8,8,Thor: Ragnarok,"Although the main comedy, but in fact, a lot of laughter is not a success, some special effects, set and lens language are very TV drama level. Marvel film has become more and more like a high investment TV series. The personal comedy style brought by the director is a bit out of place with the action play of the assembly line. A lot of light hits are completely isolated from the background."
31 October 2017,groverjon,504,992,1,"Choked by Jokes, Thor- Fishing for Funny Gags - Beginners Gude",If you like goofball comedies it's great.If you like big shiny CGI and blustering action sequences and fights its great.If you like high campery and pantomime villains -ITS AMAZING.If you like endless jokes at the expense of any real character or story development in place of any type of gravitas and epicness-ITS PERFECT.I personally don't like much of the above....You'll see it and forget about it 30mins later but tell all your friends how funny it was....One redeeming feature- it felt like a zany comic book made into a film and wasn't mopey and angsty like recent X-men MCU offerings.
6 November 2017,MegaGothmog,13,20,7,"Entertaining, and yet...","I saw this movie a few days ago. And i liked it enough to write a review. Although... i liked it, yet it also had some major flaws that need to be pointed out.Tradition-wise... Good sides first:The Acting: The acting is overall good, as we can expect from Marvel by now. They hardly ever get a serious miss-cast and they did not have it here either. The lines are good, the story is solid and the overall feeling of the movie is absolutely entertaining. Also newcomers like Cate Blancett (Hela) and Karl Urban (Skurge) were part of the world immediately.CGI: Again a no-brainer with Marvel, yet i'd like to point it out anyway, mostly because it is heavily relying on CGI. We spend our entire movie either in Asgard or on other worlds, and practically no time on earth. A lot of blue-screen and CGI had to go into this for it to look even remotely good.Story: The story on itself is not a bad one. Thor comes back from saving another day and finds out that Loki has taken Odin's throne (we knew that from The Dark World). But then Hela comes in and tries to claim Asgard for her own and banishes the brothers. Thor becomes a gladiator (somehow) and Loki is up to his usual mischief. Slightly predictable when it comes to characters and story, yet entertaining nonetheless.Now for the bad sides... because every movie has those.Acting: It is also listed as a good side, yet it has become predictable. The characters have lines that are their trademarks. Thor being bad-ass, Loki being mischievous again and all the characters are no different. We know it by now, and despite that it is part of their character... there is little new there. Although... that is not true, because:....Jokes: .... they now have jokes. I have no idea where this came from, but the entire movie felt like a buddy-action-comedy. There was not the more serious Marvel feel that we had during Thor 1 or The Avengers. A few gags here and there, but still during a serious story. Now the one joke came after the other, with almost slap-stick like comedy. This is definitely the biggest thing that i do not like about this movie. New characters like Jeff Goldblum's 'Grandmaster' were awkward as hell. I don't know why Marvel felt the need to do this, but it did not feel right. The only jokes that were worth it were the ones we saw during the trailers, but the rest were made by characters that had no real sense of humor before. And that was also the main reason why this felt so out of place. Thor was never the joking kind of guy... yet now he made about a dozen jokes. The characters felt almost re-written to suddenly, and inexplicably, be more funny. This was a definite misfire. Overall it was an entertaining movie, but the joking around was almost cringe-worthy at times. It put a huge damper on the overall feeling of what a Marvel Movie should have. I like the movie... don't get me wrong.... but they should go back to the original, and more serious, mood of storytelling. 6.5"
6 November 2017,markthomassintek,10,19,9,The most dysfunctional family in the universe,"REVIEW - THOR RAGNAROKThe most dysfunctional family in the universe. I've been getting tired of all the Marvel and DC films recently and with more on the horizon to come I didn't fancy the thought of sitting through another. THOR RAGNAROCK I must admit did surprise. It helped that it wasn't set on Earth because the feats were far better contained in this story than all of the previous based on defending the Earth and actually this film rather than making me cringe at Tony Stark did actually make me laugh. Interesting story to keep it moving, of course great special effects and stunts but again what tipped this into the positive was the humour. Worth seeing, don't think just enjoy. Rating 9 out of 10"
25 May 2020,ljsmith-25626,8,12,9,Visually Stunning,"A lot of the negative reviews surrounding Thor: Ragnarok focus on the character assassination of Thor as we know him before this film. You must have to be a die hard fan of the comic books to take issue with his u-turn in personality. As far as I'm concerned, there's a case to be made that Thor: The Dark World might be the worst film in the MCU, and it was always going to take something drastic to get cinema goers back in the door to see a sequel. I applaud Taika Waititi for doing just that.Ragnarok is pitched as a comedy, which tries too hard at times to be funny, but overall works in finally giving Thor some personality. It has been a bizarre character arc watching this almighty Norse god transition into a slapstick joker figure. But it works (even if the transition is as sudden as the flick of a switch). The plot of Ragnarok focuses on the destruction of Asgard and therefore it can seem out of place at times when Thor's new colourful personality clashes with scenes relating to the decimation of his home realm. But overall the film functions very well as a comedy and is genuinely funny. Special mention must be given to the hilarious Korg (again, props to Taika Waititi).Thor isn't the only character who finally gets a dose of personality in Ragnarok - the Incredible Hulk does too. It's never fully explained how the Hulk ends up on the planet of Sakaar, which is so far away that even Heimdall can barely see it. But we don't question it too much. I'm struggling to think of a more enjoyable scene in the entire MCU than the arena battle between Thor and Hulk, and their chemistry onscreen after this point makes for the best relationship between two Avengers. The only person who probably didn't enjoy the Hulk in Ragnarok is Edward Norton, who I believe had much darker and maturer ideas in mind for his character back in 2008. These creative differences that forced him to quit the franchise have finally paid off.Overall however it was not the comedy and colourful characters that made me enjoy Ragnarok the most. From start to finish the film is visually stunning and I think it is this more than anything else that will force me in finding myself rewatching Ragnarok over and over again. By far and away the best Thor instalment and definitely one of the best in the MCU. 9/10."
7 June 2020,f-06379,6,8,8,Thor: Ragnarok,"Each character's flattening degree in the story is beyond imagination. Marvel seems to use a big party to go beyond its boundaries, but in fact, it just wraps the boundaries more and more tightly. It constantly provides the audience with what we want to see, without any challenge. It's not about serving the audience anymore."
19 July 2020,dieseldemon85,7,11,7,Better than I expected,"I have never really liked comic book films, or much sci-fi. I'm more of the action film, euro slashers (giallo), comedies. That being said, I enjoyed watching this one, way more than Endgame. Had a nice balance of action, humour. Jeff Goldblum was fun and eccentric as always, Hemsworth, Blanchette, Ruffalo, Alba were all great. I really would like to see Chris play Bond after Craig retires. He's got it all. Looks, physique,charm, accent, established career. Just like Roger Moore."
23 July 2020,0w0,7,12,9,The best Marvel movie there is...,"This movie has everything you'd possibly want: Comedy, Action, Drama, and it's got exactly what all Marvel superhero movie fans are looking for: Tonnes of battles between supers.Taika Waititi did a fantastic job with this film and I honestly wasn't expecting it to be so good... I seriously hope that they give Taika more opportunities in the future to direct more big-budget films like those in the Marvel franchise.As an 'overall movie' for general audiences of all ages it's an 8/10 movie, but for Marvel movie fans and general superhero/DC franchise fans, it's definitely a 9/10 movie."
31 October 2017,piecookie,62,115,8,Fantastic entertainment!,"This movie is fantastic. The colors, the vibe, the humor, the action, it just makes me want to see it again. Marvel nailed it once more, to be honest this is even better than guardians of the galaxy.And Korg, my god whoever came up with the idea for this character is a comedic genius.The only thing I think is weird is the look of Hulk, something just looks weird about him, he looks too plastic/CGI or something.I definitely would recommend this movie, great entertainment!"
8 May 2021,Puroo,8,14,9,"Now that all haters have marked this Unhelpful, I will increase the score from 8 to 9/10.","What part of it did you not find helpful? Is there something I was unable to explain properly in this long review? Did I miss out on something every viewer must know? If not, then how dare you mark this Unhelpful? I spent so long and wrote this much, only so that you can vandalise my work? You know what, now I have increased the rating by one more star. If I see another person mark it unhelpful, I will give it a solid 10/10. Not because I liked the movie that much, but just to rub salt on your wound. I am also going to mark all the low rated reviews unhelpful, because I know these are the people who have done the same to me. With all that said, let's continue with the review.After the release of Infinity War, I had begun bingewatching all the MCU movies. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I wasn't feeling like watching this movie. After seeing Thor and Thor: The Dark World, I had taken the assumption that Thor movies are always bleak and lifeless. They always try to be serious when they can't possibly do it when they have characters like Thor, Loki and Odin. And so when it was time for me to watch this movie I was very reluctant, because I knew I can't skip it. But I'm glad I sat through this movie, because it was a huge improvement.The movie started out in Asgard, from the point where Thor: The Dark World left (and honestly the only thing I remember about that movie). The way that movie had ended, I had thought this movie would build more on Loki pretending to be Odin. But that ended immediately. Instead this movie focuses on Thor and Loki's estranged sister Hela, who had been abandoned by Odin at a young age. She easily manages to defeat both Thor and Loki and sends them to exile on Sakaar, with Thor reaching the planet two weeks after Loki. That was the part where the movie skyrockets the interest. I like everything about it movie from a cinematic point of view - the CGI, the acting, the comic timings, the story, the dialogues. Everything is absolutely perfect. I could undoubtedly say that this is one of, if not the best superhero movies which is not an origin story but rather a continuation of events. The comedy of the arc is the selling point. My favourite dialogue was the rock guy saying, ""I planned to start a revolution but didn't publish enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up.""After Thor, Loki, Hulk and Valkyrie come back to Asgard to stop Hela we get the best CGI ever witnessed with Thor. I really like how his eyes glow whenever he has to shoot lightning. I always wanted him to be like that. Thor really had a very drastic character development. I know many people have said this - he lost his father, learnt about his sister, his friends were killed, his precious hair was cut by none other than Stan Lee himself, he continuously got taken down by Valkyrie and lost against Hulk, his entrie planet got blown up and his people encountered Thanos in space. And yet this was the funniest MCU movie yet. And not just Thor, every scene that had Loki in it was always interesting too.However, this movie was obviously not without its set of flaws. For starters the elephant in the room, the amount of exposition that was given throughout the movie was too much, with most of it never being mentioned any time afterwards. There was even a scene where Thor is explained everything about Sakaar on a virtual trip, but it was never talked about afterwards nor was it necessary. If it wasn't for this unnecessary padding of runtime, I'd have given it 10/10. The Planet Hulk arc was also quite unexplored from the comics, and it would have been great if they made a spinoff movie on Hulk also since Hulk has never been given a solo movie starring Mark Ruffalo. Then the biggest plot hole, Valkyrie electrocuting Thor also didn't make sense since Thor is literally the God of Thunder and he shoots lightning from his hands. And then when Hela pins Thor he gets the ex-machina of his father telling him about his superpowers.Thor: Ragnarok is an excellent MCU movie. It's kinda sad that this can't be enjoyed unless you've watched Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because it could have really been cool to show to someone who has no idea what the MCU is all about. It does have the good reward to it, since you can watch Avengers: Infinity War after it. And the tone of this movie is so flexible that even the grim Infinity War completely suits in being its sequel."
5 November 2017,valent-40222,38,56,5,A relatively funny parody not a good Thor movie,"I don't understand... I found this movie bad, really awful: Thor and Loki had the wrong characterizations, Thor's lines sounded like something said by Tony Stark not by an Asgardian god, Loki was out of character as king and so weak that it was just pathetic to see, and I don't comment on the rest of the movie! I mean, even Hulk and Banner were different from their previous characters. And the jokes, oh the jokes: way too many and in the end the main part of them was just lame, not fanny at all (I laughed maybe 3 times and only for Loki's more cynical lines). Have the producers and the writers at least read the comics or watch with care and attention the previous movies? I am disappointed, it could have been such a great Thor movie..."
18 November 2017,JayPatton88,8,14,3,Thor has a brother,"Utterly horrible film! As bad as the predecessors ?

23 January 2020,dar0417,4,6,7,This format works really well for this film,I am not the biggest fan of the comic book movie genre but this one had enough solid laughs and action to actually work. Even if it is about some dude flying around with his hammer half the film.

I felt The first and older ones (pre-Disney takeover) were the best ones to date, and then I saw this one. It is so entertaining, and a joy for your eyes the whole time. Not just the special effect though filled with story, jokes and music that will keep you starring at your screen. Finally a Marvel movie that is not filled with Disney advertisements and politically driven side stories. The very best that Marvel has put out in years!"
8 November 2017,view_and_review,13,29,7,Good but not MCU good,"It's very clear that the MCU was greatly influenced by the success of Deadpool. What do I mean by that? Well, Deadpool was largely a comedy with action or an action comedy (however you choose to define it) and it seems that Thor: Ragnarok followed the same mold (less the abundant profanity).The question is: did it work? Judging by the amount of laughter I heard in the packed theater... yes. As for myself... not so much. It was entertaining and I did chuckle a few times myself, but I could have sufficed with fewer laughs and a little more substance. I was not that impressed with the nemesis, Hela (Cate Blanchett), with no onus on Cate because she's great. Hela just wasn't an interesting enough or captivating enough foe. And while I have generally loved Hulk's roles in the two Avenger movies, he was too cartoonish in Thor: Ragnarok. I mean he was literally more cartoonish instead of the more lifelike look he had in the other movies and he was more cartoonish in his behavior.I love the crossovers that Marvel does now (adding other Marvel characters) and that does boost its overall enjoyment value. There were some added characters around Thor in this movie that was nice. But boiling the movie down to the story and the execution of that story, it was more ehh. It was still entertaining and a fun night at the movies but not MCU good."
15 October 2020,coolfriendsmugee,8,10,10,The most fun marvel movie and best for that reason,"The plot moves smoothly and the jokes don't stop, but there's still tons of action and excitement.

No one has done it better before or since."
2 November 2017,anuragk61,22,33,1,Good actors not so good movie,"Excess of anything is bad and this goes for this movie too. I know Marvel really do not want their audience to have second thoughts about the plot of their movies and so they fill their movies with jokes which sometimes work and sometimes are just lame, if you are going to watch this movie just watch it for good acting and action but do not have high expectation from the story line.Still waiting for Marvel to deliver us a good story after the Winter Soldier."
10 September 2020,waqassaleem-85201,7,12,10,Top 5 mcu movie,"It is a film filled with humor, drama, action, etc. The story of the film is great. A bid step up from Thor: The Dark World. The screenplay of the film is good. The direction is great. The performances of the cast are amazing. Special mention to the character Korg he is a really lovable character like Groot. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. Definitely the best Thor movie. A must watch."
12 November 2017,thirtyfivestories,5,7,5,Jokes Don't Save Lives,"Restrained in chains and dangling above a hellish inferno, Thor seems a bit more jovial this time around. The serious face has withered away, and a sarcastic comedian prances through battles with lackadaisical flair. The stoicism has been traded in for improvised one-liners, a calling card of his Avenger co-workers.Cannon story lines are immediately abandoned as this third installment grinds itself into an intergalactic buddy cop movie. Studios love to beat a winning formula into submission, and dilute all originality from newcomer directors. The structure of banished, enslaved, regrouped, and returned is about as fresh as gas station pizza.The reconciliation at the start of the narrative is drunk with convenience, and the cameo-ridden moments of the first act are more rushed than a 6th grade science project. The film desperately reaches for compelling set pieces, however, the cliché and predictable plot advancements reveal half-baked CGI, and sloppy line deliveries.​Brothers, who evidently have an unlimited number of do-overs, have lazy, quick-serve conflict. The Hulk has a clunky motivation and tags along because of reasons. And Valkyrie has about the most blatantly constructed redemption backstory you could give an one off character.A story that embraces the absurd offers a fluffy, yet enjoyable rainbow ride into family feuds. Bleak late battle decisions dish out compelling conclusions, and the easy way out erodes with existential U-turns. The least serious Thor has stumbled upon the most intimate conflict in his reign, and he's only barely emotionally capable of vanquishing his sibling foe."
8 November 2017,RforFilm,11,22,10,"Cosmic, funny, and fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a god of thunder that is the best of the Thor series","By the Gods! We got another Thor movie in the mix. For a character that's the Norse God of thunder, you'd think he would be a favorite for a lot of people. For most, however, have admitted that out of all the avengers, Thor is rarely a favorite. Maybe not the character, as Chris Hemsworth carries a lot of the charm and naiveté needed for this type, but more for his movies. Perhaps he works better a part of a team, but other heroes like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and even Captain America, once considered to be the most boring avenger, are capable of operating on their own. So why have the Thor movies struggled to find their own identity? I think it has to do with how soon they brought him into the Marvel cinematic universe. At the time, the current heroes were manifestations of science and Thor was something more cosmic. The first movie tried to bridge that gap by saying Thor's ""magic"" was science evolved. Yet future Marvel stories like Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange have been capable of producing more fantasy-like scenarios. Let's see if Thor: Ragnarok can fully embrace a more ""cosmic"" journey that can make the character entertaining.Since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) has been trying to find the Infinity Stones away from Earth and his home of Asgard. When he's made aware that his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) has been masquerading has their father, he returns to demand that they go get him. Thor and Loki are led to Norway where Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) is dying. Upon that moment, the goddess of Death Hela (played by Cate Blanchett) is released. She not only reveals that she's Thor's older sister, therefore rightful heir to Odin's throne, but that she once led armies across the realms of the universe.Thor and Loki attempt to get back to Asgard, Hela sends them into space where both land on a garbage planet. Thor ends up captured by a bounty hunter Scrapper 142 (played by Tessa Thompson) and is taken to the ruler of the planet, the Grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum). Though Thor is forced into being a gladiator to try and win his freedom, he's relieved that his opponent is none other then the Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) whose been missing for two years. Thor has to figure out how to get back Bruce Banner, get off this planet, and stop Asgard from the Ragnarok destruction.I stand by that the first two Thor movies were good. Thor: Ragnarok is great! This is a fun cosmic adventure that may be just as good as those Guardians of the Galaxy films. It's clear that Thor has fully embraced just what his character can go through in his kind of situation with new planets, creatures and powers. But what separates it from the previous movies further is a sense of self aware that adds a lot of much needed humor. In fact, many of the scenes on the Grandmasters planet reminded me of Big Trouble in Little China.As before, the casting is good, but it's almost all the new stars that nearly steel the show from Thor. Cate Blanchett is definitely having a ball as the villain, bringing a lot of class, yet a bit of insanity that fits her in to the Marvel universe. Jeff Goldblum is a joy, though a lot of has to do with that he's playing himself. Though it's a shame we aren't getting any more Hulk movies, Thor Ragnarok is clearly evolving the character the more Bruce Banner is in the Hulk state, and Mark Ruffalo does well, just as much of a fish out of water.But the main reason that Thor: Ragnarok may be the best of the Thor series is that we really feel like that Thor himself went on a major journey. Without spoiling anything, He finds out a lot of dark truths about his father and the past of Asgard that makes him question what's worth saving. Just how can his people survive? Should his home survive? It all comes together and feels earned. I'll give this ten Thor helmets out of ten. 2017 has been a successful year for Marvel and if you needed a reason, this should justify that. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have seen the other Thor movies or even the other Avengers movies before watching this, but I don't think it's totally necessary. This feels the most separated from The Avengers in tone (though that's because I'm only counting Marvel heroes that are a part of the Avengers) and should cater to science fiction and fantasy fans that wanted the series to take bigger chances. Let's just say that Thor: Ragnarok is a defined thunder god in form and should be watched."
15 November 2021,jamal-hakeem,20,29,2,"Not Everything Is A Joke, Disney (and Disney Fans)","The god of thunder is both serious in the mythology and in the Thor comic books.Why create a Thor movie if you hate the Thor character and Asgard??Surely, Disney does not have a copyright on Nose mythology. Someone should make a serious and watchable thor movie. I would pay to watch that."
26 October 2017,JimmyTheFilmCritic,41,71,9,Thor Ragnarok,"First things first, if you like Marvel Studio films then you're going to enjoy this one. If you dislike Marvel Studio films (why?) then this one isn't going to convince you to jump on board with the MCU. Thor and Hulk/Banner team up and the banter between the two is at times very funny. Tessa Thompson did give a decent performance as Brunnhilde, but to be honest, I'd rather have had Jaimie Alexander's Sif in this flick as we've got history with that character. However, I definitely see Brunnhilde becoming integral part of the MCU and can see her character being expanded upon if they make a Thor 4.The soundtrack (which I loved), CGI, and action all complement the movie. Taika Waititi directing was, as always superb and I would love to see Marvel Studios give him more projects to work on. I think his humor would fit Spider-Man or Iron Man pretty well. The reason this doesn't get ten stars because yet again the villain is underdeveloped and although we're told time and time again that Hela is this all powerful Goddess I don't quite feel it. I can't really discuss it without going into spoilers, but I found the character underwhelming a bit. However, Cate Blanchett was amazing both to look at and her performance. I would highly recommend you go see this. Probably best Superhero movie of the year in my opinion."
5 December 2020,tgainey14,8,12,10,Misery Loves Company,I thought this movie was incredible. Fun action scenes but very spread apart ill agree with that. Hilarious if you're in the mood for a chuckle but I wouldn't listen to the bad reviews. Its an enjoyable movie that showcases Chris' comedic timing. And a good development in the character of Thor. Highly recommend. Dont listen to the pessimists who think everything needs to be exactly like they imagined.

30 April 2018,vinniec-53536,6,8,9,Best Film of the 'Thor' Trilogy By Far!,"'Thor: Ragnarok' was amazing! Best film of the 'Thor' trilogy by far. The action scenes were mesmerizing, the humor was some of the funniest in any superhero movie I've ever seen, the story was captivating, and the acting was superb, with the standout performances being Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, and Korg (who is actually voiced by the film's director Taika Waititi). An instant classic (in my opinion), 'Ragnarok' is one of the best films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I also can't forget to mention Hela, the main villain played brialliantly by Cate Blanchett, who has a very interesting, and personal, connection to the God of Thunder. And if you've been wondering what Hulk has been up to since we last saw him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', you'll find out! Overall, 'Thor: Ragnarok' was a joy to watch, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Now bring on 'Avengers: Infinity War'!!"
24 July 2021,Dust_in_it_off,9,14,10,Best Marvel Movie,This is the best entry in the MCU. Good balance of action and comedy. It's two hours and ten minuets but doesn't feel like it (unlike some other MCU movies)
27 October 2017,zekehardrock,36,72,3,Guardian of the Galaxy : Ragnarok,"I don't know where to start. I love MCU superhero movie. Thor is my favorite after Captain American and Doctor Strange. The first movie was good, the second was outstanding, and when I hear Ragnarok will be the third (and probably last) Thor movie, I'm thrill. I hope this movie gonna be majestic like lord of the ring movie, aaaaand we got this awful movie.Ragnarog should be the perfect conclusion for Thor trilogy, especially when you have Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett in it. F**kin 'Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett !!! Whats wrong with you people !!Dark and gritty theme is not for all superhero movie. And vice versa, not all movies can be made as comedy budy action. Leave that genre to Guardian of the Galaxy. Thor is meant to be be Shakespeare's Norse mythology movie. What makes GOG works, because they able to develop their great characters and the relation between. Hell even GOG Vol 2 know how to pull a line somewhere between their jokes and make me cry in the end of the movie. Thor : Ragnarog is just bad rip off from GOG with plenty of miss-placed jokes.I also disappointed with wasted talents of great actors. You will be fascinated in the first 10 minutes Cate Blanchett. But after that, just bland acting, bad dialogue and the editing is the worst. At least make powerful and touching dialogue between Thor, Odin and Hela, as they're presented by great actors. but noooooo. Hela has no special motivation, no expression, only an unclear desire to rules Asgard and other 9 realm.I don't get it with all people who rating this movie above 5 and said it it the best MCU experience so far. Have you no respect for Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Civil Wars and the noise mythology? you guys need to watch more movie. certainly whatever my opinion, this movie will still make a lot of money. and I also have good time. Not great, but good"
24 July 2021,Dust_in_it_off,10,16,10,Best Marvel Movie,"Best entry out of them all. Perfect blend of action and comedy. I see a lot of comments here complain about how they didn't like ""the dumbing down"" of Thor's character, but I enjoyed it, especially since that is how he portrayed in actual Norse mythology, all brawn and no brain."
7 November 2017,Aaron1375,12,27,10,"This Thor was strange, random and completely out there...of course I loved it!","I was not sure what to expect from this Thor film as I saw only one trailer of the film. It seemed to be having multiple things going on and a lot of randomness so when I finally saw the finished product it was a very random at times movie. It was also a very fun film and I enjoyed it immensely as there were more than a couple Marvel characters in the film. I knew Hulk was going to be in it, but he appeared in the film a lot more than I was expecting speaking more in this film than all his three solo films combined. I was not sure what to expect from Loki either, but sure enough he was his usual self and once again I really enjoyed the scenes with him and Thor together as they have such an interesting relationship. There is a lot going on in this one and it almost had the feel of a Guardians of the Galaxy film, just with Thor interjected into it.The story has Thor fighting a being who wishes to bring about the end of Asgard. Thor fights this being and wins, thus hopefully stopping this Ragnarok from occurring. He soon returns to Asgard where he reveals to everyone that Odin has been replaced by Loki. The two go to find Odin on earth and Thor is assisted by the sorcerer supreme. Thor and Loki learn of Thor's sister who is soon to be released upon the world where she takes over Asgard while Thor ends up on a strange junk planet ruled by the Grandmaster. Thor must battle the champion of the planet, find a way off the planet so that he may return home and try to reclaim the throne from his diabolical sister.Love the characters of Thor and Loki as they always have such humorous exchanges. There is a scene where Thor is imprisoned on a chair and I am thinking I see Loki kind of just chilling in the crowd and sure enough it was him. I also liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in the film as he is all disjointed and a bit messed up. Seems the Hulk has been the far more dominating persona as of late and I found it humorous that both Banner and Hulk accused Thor of liking the other one more. Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett also did well in their roles.So fun is the way I am describing this film as it is like a Guardians film or the latest Spider-man film. With the passing of my fiancé I do not have a lot to look forward to these days, but I do look forward to the latest Marvel release. The films keep being very entertaining and they make me smile if only for a bit and for that I am grateful. I will probably see the Justice League film when it comes out in a couple of weeks as well, but I am sure I will not like it as much. Marvel just works better for me I guess. I mean, they do not fear having a scene where Hulk is in a hot tub and gets out and you see his bare ass! Just a very enjoyable film that kept me entertained and made me forget my depression if only for a bit, but even if it is only temporary I am still grateful."
20 October 2017,harunilgin,669,1290,10,Damn you Marvel!!!!,"Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy of what superhero films could look like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer and lug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok."
19 May 2020,DoctorDragon,6,9,10,Best THOR movie,"People nowadays are forgetting how to enjoy life...when I go see a marvel movie I am ready to laugh, getting surprised and enjoy fight scenes.
I think that this is part of the cinema, not something different. We have different opinions and tastes, and that's great! Life without any difference would be boring. But hating on a product well done, the first really comedy-superhero movie, is not fair.
I accept constructive criticism, it is the start point for a better future. But hating is just childish...you will never be heard by anyone by doing it.About Thor Ragnarok: I really liked the fight scenes, Loki is amazing in this movie, I loved Fenrir, Hela is a really great villain. You are never bored in this movie, it is a really entertaining one. I also really liked the way they treated Hulk and Banner. The durability between the characters is really interesting.

5 February 2018,kevinxirau,6,10,5,Fun but not quite the way I wanted to see.,"2017 was quite a year for superheroes. We've had ""Logan"", ""Wonder Woman"", ""Justice League"", and, today's topic, ""Thor Ragnarok"". When I heard that they were working on this story, I was hyped. For those not mythology savvy, Ragnarok is the Norse doomsday, where many of the classic gods and monsters die in an epic final showdown, including the mighty Thor. Now, I knew Thor himself wouldn't die because, hey, he's a highly marketable character, but the stakes nevertheless are raised and that alone makes for a compelling reason to go into this next step on his journey. Anyway, the film's a combo of ""Avengers: Disassembled"" and ""Planet Hulk"", both pretty serious stories and I actually expected it to be so like ""Capt. America: Civil War"" tone-wise. Then the trailers came and they had the exact opposite feel, all bright and jokey, and the actual film was exactly that.Plot: Thor is in trouble when Odin's absence leaves Asgard open to attack by the dreaded death goddess Hela, who turns out to have quite a history on Asgard he never imagined. Worse yet, he gets stuck on the planet Sakaar, ruled by the flamboyant yet ruthless Grandmaster. And so, the god of thunder must team up with his brother Loki, the disgraced Valkyrie, and the incredible Hulk to escape and save his people. As usual in the MCU, acting is spot-on and there are some nice effects, cool worlds, and great action. The highlight was the gladiator battle between Thor and Hulk, which is brutal, well-staged, and had both epic and hilarious moments (Loki's reactions were priceless). Hela stands out more than most of the MCU villains. She was pretty tough, had a nice backstory, and Cate Blanchett looked like she was having a good time with her role (plus, she rocked that outfit). Some of the other new characters were great like Valkyrie, who serves her own unique brand of badass female fighter. There's also a great cameo by another fantasy-themed superhero, who stole the show when he appeared.That all being said, I can't say I love this one. As previously stated, a story with dark origins has been made bright and comedic. Too much like it. I feared this would happen after seeing the trailers and was proven right. I did laugh a lot, but given that this is Ragnarok we're talking about, the end of Thor's home, the tone didn't sit well for me. In fact, this film tried WAY too hard to be ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Thor felt like a different person, snarky and a bit clumsy rather than stoic and competent like he was before, losing the charm he had before. Most of the cast we've come to know and love from Thor 1 and 2 are taken out in the most undignified ways (some don't even get a line), which really irritates me to no end. We also spend so much time on the Planet Hulk part of the story that the titular conflict and its themes aren't as developed as they should have been (you can tell right from the poster), especially Hela's relationship with Thor. Plenty of things are not given proper explanation like how Hulk ended up on Sakaar and a few new characters like Korg that are shadows of their comic counterparts. The effects went into serious CGI overload, to the point where much of it is as convincing as an old video game; the film might as well have been animated.Overall, while I did get a few kicks out of ""Thor: Ragnarok"", it went the wrong direction, its potential in compelling storytelling wasted. ""Iron Man 3"" had its own problems and even that offered more to me than this, which is saying something. In a franchise brimming with epic stories and characters, this chapter is one of the few big duds. At least I have ""Infinity War"" to look forward to."

16 October 2020,Everymoviegetsa10,7,14,10,Still not my Thor but its still good.,"Thor in Thor Ragnarök is like a Peter Pan, King Arthur and Thor mixed into 1.Thor Ragnarök is Ragnarök and Planet Hulk in one. Its really a 15% Planet hulk and a miniature Ragnarok. Its nothing like the comics or mythos. matter of fact its a simple kiddie version of Ragnarok.The movie starts out as Thor as a badass and ends, in the middle he is a baddass and ends with him being a badass. Thor finally gets some justice pre-infinity war.Visually its a step up from Thor 2. Thor has evolved so much since Thor 1. Thor overall is gold.
Loki is gold.
Hulk is just Silver. They could have done more with him.Grandmaster is a chilled gentle, dictator who isn't afraid to kill.Odin once again is wasted. MOST WASTED MCU CHARACTER EEEEEVEEEER.Valkyrie looked like those Ferby dolls that we use to get from our happy meals when were were snot nosed kids. She's in the story because of guilt and amosity.Then there is Hela MCUs best villain before Thanos. (Loki in mcu is more of an anti hero. That's just me.) There was no best before Hela. ulton was decent to say the least.Overall it's a space/gladiator/doomsday/viking/drama/medieval/fantasy/comedy movie. Mighty fun.Great movie indeed. Thor 1 is the best for me because it was the live action debut of the mighty Thor. Thor 3 is mighty 2nd and Thor 2 gets 3rd.Verdict: See you on the other side Brotha!!!"

13 February 2021,Abdulxoxo,6,11,7,A different instalment in the Thor franchise,"Thor: Ragnarok is jam-packed with comedy. From the opening scene to the final post-credit sequence this film wanted to make us laugh. From that reason it felt more like 'Guardians of the Galaxy' than even the previous 'Thor' movies. It's bright, colourful, and a lot of fun. We were introduced to some fantastic new characters. Among them are The Grandmaster, who is funny, crazy in a way that's charismatic. Valkyrie is good too. Her character has a dark past, but she's strong, Tessa Thompson did a good job. Hela is a pure pantomime villain. The cinematography in this movie was incredible. With help from all the visual effects, the film looks fantastic. In particular there were two or three battle scenes where the film moved in slow motion and what we saw on screen looked like a classic heaven and hell themed oil painting you might find in an art gallery. Those were truly stunning to look at. The choice of music was also good - in particular the Immigrant song. Now I can't listen to the song without having picturing the scene where Thor fights Hela's minions. But to be honest, Thor 3 with the humor felt like a kid's movie at times. One scene which involved Thor throwing something and it bouncing back hitting him on the head was funny, but it's cheap humour. On the whole, I enjoyed the performances, the cinematography, the plot, the score, and most of the humour."

Everything from an '80s synthesizer soundtrack to bright unicorn-vomit visuals is here. While the film is fun, the plot was all over the place. It felt like watching 3 movies at once. I kept thinking ""Just pick and stick with a plotline."" It jumps from location to location and story arc to story arc very quickly, and at times it was very hard to keep up with. I had to keep backtracking at least 10 minutes in my mind to catch myself up. ""Oh yeah, that happened."" Jeff Goldblum had a lot to offer as the character ""Grandmaster"". He had some funny lines and made me laugh a few times. Cate Blanchett is chilling as the villain ""Hela."" If you thought Tom Hiddleston could be scary at times, just wait until you see her performance. There were a lot of fun Easter Eggs that foreshadow at things to come and it was overall, a very fun movie. Like I said, my only complaint is the all-over-the-place plot, but considering how boring ""Dark World"" was, I'm just glad we finally got a good Thor sequel, even if at times it still could have been better.

14 August 2020,chriskylie,7,11,10,"Kitsch, crazy, zany superhero fun!","If anyone thought Marvel were losing their edge (and I must admit I had some doubts) think again. Thor Ragnarok turbo charges this strand of the franchise transforming from slightly off-kilter heavyweight fare to colourful, crowd-pleasing unadulterated comedy. Waititi embraces the kitsch in a huge tonal shift from The Dark World and it's all the better for it. Hemsworth is in his element playing every scene with a extra devilish wink in his eye. There's a host of superb new characters who all add to the fun from Blanchett's camp villain gloriously chewing all the scenery around her to Goldblum's hilarious portrayal of a futuristic well... Jeff Goldblum. My personal favourite was the Kiwi pile of rocks played with superb dead-pan humour by the film's director Waititi. There's honestly so much to enjoy here it's impossible to mention it all. Whilst I accept not every Marvel could or should be this crazy and unashamedly fun, Thor Ragnarok could well be the most enjoyable standalone film so far in the MCU."

7 November 2017,soneil12,11,19,5,Fun to watch but tries too hard to be funny,"Thor Ragnarok has all of the things you would expect in a super hero / comic adaptation. Stunning visuals, larger than life characters and humour. Perhaps not in the amounts you would expect though.I started off enjoying the movie a lot. Great action. Great cameos from beloved actors. Great visual effects. Great humour. More humour. And more humour. By the time it got to the middle of the film it felt like they were really over-doing the humour. Plenty of humour worked well in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies which always had a bit of a 'cartoonish' feel to them. But the movies centred around the avengers crew in the past, while having liberal doses of humour, were essentially serious action films. Perhaps it's because the guardians are now being brought in to the main Marvel Cinematic universe but I don't think the same tone that works in their movies really works with Thor / Avengers etc.If almost felt less like a superhero movie and more like a Pixar or Dreamworks animated feature. And some of the minor characters (like Korg) certainly would have seemed more at home in an animated feature.When it comes down to it, I found it to be an enjoyable movie but only if I didn't think too hard about it. Much of the story, characters etc are basically pretty corny for the sake of getting more laughs."

The concept is one of the best you can see in superhero movies.They balanced the humor and seriousness perfectly.There were also brutal moments which will surprise you.Especially the 3rd act is pretty brutal.I heard the laughter of audience almost on every funny moment of the movie. I never thought a Thor movie would have an awesome soundtrack.I can tell that it really gives you the Guardians of the Galaxy 1 vibes. So in general,the movie is one of its kind in this genre and very unique."

A horrible addition to the MCU which completely devalues it and everything that went before.
This is what happens when Disney get their hands on a franchise and turn into a lame, faux comedy, everything explodes, vehicle for the popcorn eating five year olds.
Anyone who invested in, and paid good money for, the values of the Marvel heroes as expoused by all that has gone before has been well and truly kicked in the teeth.
Plot? There isn't one, just a series of disconnected CGI set pieces with the worst jokes in cinematic history.
Acting? None. Every single member of the cast should be ashamed at having taken their big fat pay cheque and laughing at the poor saps foolish enough to display their loyalty by handing over hard earned cash at the box office.
Direction? None. All that was required of the director was to tell the actors which stupid lines to say to the green screen and tell the special effects team ""now blow something up""
Awful, awful, awful."
30 May 2021,Venomage03,9,17,8,Thor: Ragnarok is one of the funniest movie in the MCU,The humor is very well done. The cast does a good job delivering this humor. Hela is a pretty solid villain. One thing that I don't like about this movie are the sad scenes of the movie. They don't work very well because of the overdone humor.
25 October 2017,shumaranaman,54,95,9,Thor RagnaROCKED!,"*TWO* POST CREDIT SCENES TO WATCH!Great starting sequence was pure magic, the banter, cinematography and the ACTION! What I admired about this film is Taika Waititis brilliant humor, being from New Zealand appreciating it even more so. The action sequences were slick, crisp, and actually watchable - as opposed to many other movies who cover up the action with motion blur, too much camera work or just not enough scene time to appreciate the spectacle. Hulk and Thor were brilliant in this film, CGI was the best I've seen for the Hulk, and his scenes with Thor are hilariously funny. Hella was hellish and I loved it, her story interestingly made sense tying her into the movie and not making it feel forced. Supporting cast of Valkyrie, Skurge, Korg, Grandmaster, Loki, Odin etc... all had their place and they all had their moments to shine, which is hard to do in a movie with a plethora of characters. Only thing to note is the pacing is sometimes a bit abrupt going to and from other stories happening within the movie, but it's not a biggy at all. One small thing is some impactful and emotional scenes (which you'll know what I'm talking about) didn't feel like it had the depth or impact that it should of – Maybe it's just me, but I'll see this movie a few more times over and maybe edit this as I would have had more time to reflect on it. All in all, from start to finish Ragnarok is a roller coaster ride of beautiful action pieces, quirky and snappy humor and a flagship for other Superhero movies to strive Thor!"

If you don't like humour, if you think that heroes have to be serious, then this movie is not for you, you would be totally disappointed and you would give a low score, just because of your anger.

Of course it has some spectacular images, as one would expect with so much CGI being thrown around.The Jeff Goldblum character was annoying instead of funny.

10 December 2020,SebMoz,7,12,8,"Nothing but jokes and one-liners, and I love it","I must admit, the first two Thor movies are some of my least favorite movies in the entire MCU. They both feel very silly and not very competent at all to me, and I was pretty worried that this was going to be similar in quality. That fear did not come true in the slightest though, as this movie is a gem that I liked way more than I should. On paper, this doesn't seem like anything special. The plot is really basic at first, the characters are just passable and so is the acting. The villain is pretty boring, and her plan felt very reharshed from previous Marvel movies. I will say though, the climax subverts your expectations really nicely, and I liked that they went in a new direction with the old ""End of the world""-trope. Still, this movie seems really basic on paper, and it probably would be in practice as well, had it not been for one crucial thing: The COMEDY. This is without a doubt the funniest movie in the entire MCU. Every scene has funny moments, every character spits out jokes and one-liners left and right. Some characters feel like they were only created to be comic relief, yet I am not even mad, as they're all comedy geniuses. My personal favorite side-character was Korg, every single word that came out of his mouth was pure gold, and the same can be said for several other characters as well. Loki worked way better as a side-kick than the antagonist, which was something I pointed out about Thor: The Dark World (In practice the only thing that movie got right). And the fact that Jane and Erik wasn't in the movie, yet I didn't miss them for a second, unfortunatly speaks to their worth as characters. This entire movie is comedy gold, there is no other way to describe it. Every scene is great, every joke lands, this is such a delightful movie. It doesn't really have much to offer in terms of multi-layered themes like some other MCU movies, and is therefore not as good, but it's still a awesome movie that greatly exceeded my expectations with how much fun I had watching it. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys dumb, hilarious jokes and slap-stick (Which, for the record, I'm not usually a fan of), and to anyone that likes Marvel movies in general. This is by far the best Thor movie and probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. It's just that hilarious."
30 June 2020,dmshrmed,7,10,10,Best Marvel Film,"You may not agree that it's the best Marvel film, but it is at least the best of the Thors. The poor writing and lackluster characters that held back the previous Thor films are either done away with or remastered to a much higher quality.Much needed humor is injected into the world of Thor. The previous two Thor's took themselves far too seriously. However, that does not suggest a lack of serious themes in this film. They take center stage when they need to.You'll probably enjoy this film as long as you're not a pretentious man-child still clinging to comic books as if they're some kind of infallible scripture. Not every super hero film needs to be directly transcribed from a specific comic story. Get over yourselves."

The casting for new characters works well, and the other cast fielded for the storyline helps put on an excellent display. The fight scenes are thrilling and deliver a new side of the namesake character, with the soundtrack assisting. Comedic genius is what the former films had lacked somewhat- in this it is truly hilarious at times. The character design is intriguing, as well. Overall, the plot is exciting and sets the characters up well for the next films."
14 November 2020,Mikheil-H,7,11,8,A breath of fresh air,"It is fair to say that out of all the Marvel superheroes, Thor has not had the best run, commonly viewed as having the worst solo outings. However, that all changes with the recent release of Thor: Ragnarok, his third film, proving that the character still has life in him yet.We follow Thor, played by returning star Chris Hemsworth, as he attempts to take on the magical knife-weilding Hela ""The Goddess of death"" (Cate Blanchett). We see Thor join up with a wide multitude of characters including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and The Hulk/ Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). Although the standout is the hilarious newcomer of Korg, played by the director: Taika Waititi, who steals every scene he is in. The film is very reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy due to the fact, a large portion takes place on alien planets and relies on a very similar type of humour - which to say the least, is a good thing.Thor Ragnarok is primarily a comedy. It is hilarious. Anybody could go into this film and then come out of the cinema with a huge smile on their face. Being a superhero film, there are several highly stylised and well shot action scenes allowing Taika Waititi, to show his skill. The most memorable being the fight between the Hulk and Thor, which is pure spectacle. It is not just the action scenes that are well shot, it is most scenes in general. Granted, it is no Blade Runner, but every scene is packed with so much colour that you can't help but admire it.
Being the 17th Marvel movie, it is fair to say that a lot of people are feeling a ""Marvel fatigue"". I know I did with Guardians of the Galaxy 2. However, Ragnarok, thankfully, breathes new life into its characters and its universe, as there are events that will have consequences in future Marvel movies. Before Ragnarok, Thor was very much a background character, for example; if someone asks you to name a superhero, you would probably say quite a few before even considering Thor. But Ragnarok increases the characters likeability immensely, doing for him what the first Iron man film did for Tony Stark. That being said, it is not perfect. If the film has to choose between a serious scene, or a joke, it will choose the joke. This can affect the flow of the film and the gravity of a situation, but it by no means ruins the film.I highly recommend getting to see this one, especially if you want a break from the seriousness of life, it is guaranteed to put a smile back on your face. With a stellar cast, spot on action, hilarious jokes and a surprising story, Thor Ragnarok is the Marvel movie to see."

6 November 2017,christophershobris,10,20,10,Best Thor Film Yet!,"After so many films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the filmmakers always seem to keep them fresh and interesting. Thor: Ragnarok is interesting and fresh to say the least. The director Taika Waititi is a genius behind the camera as he somewhat changed the feel of the Thor films but keeping some of the familiarities associated with the previous films. The comedic level is sky-high, as most of it was giggling fun thanks to Waititi's direction, as a result it seemed like the actors had a lot more fun, but had their work cut out for them. The cameos in this film are splendid especially in one particular scene with cameos by Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Liam Hemsworth (Chris Hemsworth's brother), and Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity). Cate Blanchett as always does an outstanding job as the villainess Hela. Her commitment to the role was respectable in that she actually studied a Brazilian martial art called capoeira, pretty cool right? Karl Urban also had some homework to do to get ready for his role; he shaved his hair, and worked out. The effort by the actors especially the ones I mentioned make this film that much more pleasurable, the people actually cared about the film and the story, as all films should be. The action was intense, the acting was superb, the effects were stunning, and the story was likable. However, the only problems for me that prevents it from being a 10/10 is the just the length, I actually could have gone for more, it was too short in my opinion. But that's not a fault, just a nitpick, or in another way, its actually a positive since I enjoyed the film so much, so take the rating with a pinch of salt. Overall, I loved this movie! Keep it up Marvel!"

9 April 2020,hooma814,3,4,8,Putting a Kiwi in charge was always a good idea!,"Ragnarok has such a different feel to it to the previous Thor movies and it was a move in the right direction.
Thor is easily more likeable under the direction of Taika Waititi. He was able to make sure that no one was taking themselves too seriously. The use of music was epic, especially the heavy rock at the beginning and end of the movie.Korg was such a funny character. I've loved every character that Taika has played in all his movies, and Korg is high up there. He does so much for his few scenes.
Thor vs Hulk was also a fantastic scene. Such good humour. There was a nice touch of having two antagonists with Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett each with seperate motivations made a more interesting story other than good versus evil.Great to see a few kiwis brought along with Taika with strong performances from Karl Urban and Rachel House.The only loop hole in the movie for me was the fact the Thor could destory Surtur the fire monster at the beginning of the movie. But then Hela could easily destory Thor but then couldn't equally destory Surtur? This seemed confusing and we're left to put the pieces together to accept this is ok because Surtur grew much stronger (and bigger) by being born again with the eternal flame and also he grows through being in Asgard.Great work from Taika again and great to see the kiwi humour being on the big screen."

Unfortunately your failure in the past was to have sold the copyright to some of his heroes to other producers, that tactic was used not to break in a time of crisis of movie heroes. With the explosion of movies from Spider-man (2002) the company carried on and went back to producing movies of their heroes. The first Thor movie was released in 2011, and it was a great movie. I recall the success this film has done at the time. but the second film Thor the dark world (2013) are no longer managed to be so good. Film has multiple errors in the narrative and it was very confusing, and had no villain.Thor Ragnarok begins two years after the Avengers (2012). Thor is the defending world and still does not know that your brother seized the Throne from his father in the second movie. Upon returning to Asgard discovers that your brother is leading and that your father is missing. With this he begins a long journey in search of your father along with Loki. On the way ends up having a hand of Dr. strange ""scene that is post movie credit Dr. strange"". Thor just knowing that Asgard is in danger and that Cate Blanchett (Hela) is on his way to kill everyone. He ends up finding the Hulk on the way back to Asgard in search of resume peace and order.Thor Ragnarok managed to bring the essence of Marvel after a few years. Film is very well written, has amazing graphics and impresses in the narrative. Hulk works great the hero is in your best shape and performance since the Avengers (2012), who had an excellent performance and left the film even more complete. Cate Blanchett (Hela) has an impeccable performance to me she was a great villain of the Marvel movies, your character really scary. The film is full of action with a quality humor without being forced. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) still has a great chemistry on screen that has been creating over the time together really work well and makes the story even more fluid. Marvel hit movie and managed to overcome other great long as, Avengers (2012) and Civil War (2016).The third film of Thor is the best Marvel movie ever made! Time for fun is guaranteed. A tip ... have two movie scenes post credits not lose."

Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard.

So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I brought that up just to tell you that Marvel is still standing strong until today, even at its seventeenth film, and the fact that this is one of my favorite Marvel films.I'm glad the film takes Thor differently. Unlike the first two, which are both mostly boring and trying to be very serious, this film is fun, and energetic.The best thing about this film is that it's probably the most fun entry of MCU. It's 90% filled with humor. Almost all of the main actors in the cast steals the movie. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and even Taika Waititi as Korg. They were all very interesting and funny characters, thanks to these actors that did great in their roles.I also have to give props to Taika Waititi for his direction. The film feels very fast-paced (in a good way), energetic, and fun overall. The reason why it's different to most of what MCU gave us so far is that, again, it's filled with humor most of the time. It's just a straight up superhero-comedy film. And that's what makes is MCU's most audacious film yet.Sure, the previous MCU films may have humor, but throughout the film, it's laughs and giggles. Though it sounds bad that the film is mainly comedic, the way the comedy is executed is very well done.Another plus for me is the action is very well-executed and visually stunning. The film is very colorful, and I loved the animation for the closing credits.The only flaw for me in this film is that there may be a lot of jokes in some scenes. There's this one joke, and then there's another. In return, the viewer wouldn't handle all of it. It's a minor flaw, but I thought of it, so I had to include it here.Overall, it's a very fun and colorful film. Easily the best of the Thor films, one of Waititi's best works as a director, and one of MCU's best efforts.Final Rating: 9/10 <> A"

29 April 2018,MVictorPjinsiste,3,4,8,Marvel Era Ain't Over Yet.,"Being honest, the two preceding Thors movies were meh - middle of the road, but decent movies, in which the main character was relatively restrained. This one is something else; it's wilder, funnier yet more streamlined. ""Midgard"" (us, that is) have been completely been dropped for this one, the action taking place on two worlds, one being Asgard and the other one being, huh, special.On this subject, Goldblum plays a great Gamemaster who makes a great pair with his relative Collector in GotG I. Blanchet is simply stunning, Hiddleston is at his usual excellence and let us give some credits to Hemsworth here, always playing in the right tones. He looks like he's having a hell of a time - we couldn't ask for a better Thor. On the other hand I don't see much of Tessa Thompson's character's relevance.The story is a bit fast, and less explorative than the usual first movies of a given trilogy. Battlescenes are acceptable, including one epic fight. the sets are on par with the rest of the Marvel movies, but the music got a bit on my nerves. I thought that Led Zep's Immigrant Song was a trailer exclusivity but it appears 2 times in the movies, with jarring effects. The end themes will surprise you for a Thor movie.All and all this movie was great fun, with a comprehensible story, great actors and great outcomes. Not ""Civil War stuff"" but damn close. Bravo Marvel - you did it again, against all odds."

Brannagh's take on the characters in the first film was appropriate. Watiti's take is just wrong. Did you see those skits he did after Civil War saying that Thor was in AUS waiting for someone to call him? He turned that Thor into a movie. Thor is a silly, twit. I loved the music. I even accept the story, though they really bastardized a lot of the comic book mythos, which I expect anymore. There was a great, deep story to be told here that was ruined by inappropriate humor. Now disclaimer: I don't enjoy the humor that is so popular in a lot of NZ and AUS material, so this movie was not for me. If you like simple jokes and bright flashy action with underused and somewhat pointless characters, then this could be for you. My expectations were at a higher bar and it failed."

The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty good job.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time.

They seemed forced and out of place. Good comedy flows with the context, but much of the comedy in the movie seemed put there just to try to be funny.The behaviors of a couple of the main characters were childish and inconsistent with the previous movies, and inconsistent with the characters in the comics.Chris Hemsworth, Mark Raffalo, and Jeff Goldblum all performed like they needed to go back to acting school. I guess that makes sense since Taikiki Waititi who directed the film had a performance as Korg that made me cringe.Ten gold stars to Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, and Idris Elba. Without them, the film would be a total loser.**Spoiler alert** Having the Thor character debased by screaming like a scared little girl was a desperate move by the director. Come on man, Asgard's greatest warrior and future king would never do such a thing. I guess Waititi never read the comics or saw the the previous films."

This movie has already gotten itself carved to my memory.A memorable movie for me.Just like dark knight,Logan and guardians of the galaxy 1."

If you're older, educated and have a brain, you'll know after 5 minutes of watching this it's going to be a waste of time.Completely predictable. Nothing new to see here......at all.Continuous barrage of lame jokes that a 15 year old might enjoy, but not someone with a functioning brain. Insulting to anyone with an IQ of 70 or higher.This is basically a cash grab for the Marvel movies. They would have done better having never made such rubbish. On par with DC's Justice League."

Adults don't buy as many toys, lunch boxes, flasks and posters as kiddies.Thor is now a joke and doesn't know he is the god of thunder."
6 November 2017,Spideyfan-963-246215,9,19,10,Thor: Ragnarok (2017),"Marvel comics was once my favorite brand of comics but these days not so much. They have disbanded all their classic characters Peter Parker, Bruce Banner and even Tony Stark with stupid replacements like Miles Morales, some Asian Hulk and RI RI Williams as Iron Woman, so I'm not a fan of their comics anymore. Marvel Studios has been great I have loved all their films except for Iron Man 2 and then came Spider-Man: Homecoming which is undoubtedly one of the worst things I have seen done to my favorite superhero. Now comes the third Thor film and Thor has been the weakest even though I do love both movies but this, this is cool. Thor has been going around through the nine realms trying to find answers about the Infinity Stones but as we see is captured by Surtur the fire demon. He escapes and returns to Asgard Once there he sees that Loki has taken their fathers place, he demands Loki to take him to father. After they find Odin they are greeted by Hela who destroys Thor's hammer and as the two brothers try to escape through the Bifröst, Hela plunges them both into a different Realm. Now Thor must get the help of old and new ally to help him return home and prevent Hela from destroying Asgard. The opening scene with Surtur is my favorite part of the whole movie. I was just so excited to see him since in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon he appeared briefly but he wasn't around for much. If any big gripe I have with the movie it's that I wanted to yet again see more of him and just Thor fighting. But it was great to see him finally. This is the funniest of the Thor movies and when I heard about this I was super concerned because I am not a huge fan of comedy and for a movie with a fire demon to have comedy kind of gave me a bad impression before going in. But the jokes mostly hit with me. Chris Hemsworth is funny. When they announced Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie I was very opposed to the idea, I have expressed in my review of Spider-Man: Homecoming that I hate it when comic book movies change the race of characters. It's even just as bad when they do it in Norse mythology or any myth and legend, that's not how history has shown or described them to be so to change it is just wrong. We can excuse it for Heimdal because Idris Elba is a good actor but I had no idea who this chick was, but she was great in the movie. I'm not a fan that they changed her race, Valkyrie is a white blonde. But Tessa did pretty great so I'll allow it, let's just say that's a nitpick. Cate Blanchett as Hela the Goddess of Death was amazing. Some might say that shes not that great of a villain but I disagree she's called the Goddess of death and Odin's daughter who fought alongside him. She has a clear goal of destroying her father's land because she is the goddess of death. Battleworld, where Thor meets up and battles the Hulk is a great looking environment. The fight with the hulk was great and it was great to see Jeff Goldblum have fun with himself and everyone there. The best thing about this movie is its aesthetic, the movie looks beautiful. Like a 70s or 80s high fantasy movie. That's what mostly appealed to me in this movie it was cool to see in a Thor movie. Director Taika Waititi is also in the movie voicing Korg who is one of the best new characters the MCU has introduced recently. He did a great job directing this film, I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Feige and the studio decided to keep him around to direct another Marvel project. Thor: Ragnarok is the best of all the Thor films. In a time where I believe the Marvel cinematic universe is beginning to show more cracks, Thor: Ragnarok still gives us one big fun adventurous ride with our favorite asgardians and the big green Hulk, not to mention the best music video of the Immigrant song. I'm giving my favorite Thor film a five out of five."

21 November 2017,theromanempire-1,5,9,6,Big disappointment and boredom,while the main story of the film regarding the destruction of asgard and the entry of the big evil sister could make a great enjoyable film it did not cause those beeps at marvel chose to show us an irrelevant boring secondary story which existed in the film for a beep 1 hour and 30 minutes.I'm talking about the grand master story in which also hulk was involved and that story destroyed the film for me.the whole film run 2 hours and excluding first and last 20 minutes all the rest of the movie was how hulk was fighting thor in a kind of....kolloseum or something.this part of the story should take plce around 10-15 minutes not more.I don't know why marvel had that story for more than 1 hour in to the film but it was a boredom failure.I nearly slept during those scenes and only in last 20 minutes I really enjoyed the film again but that won't save the film.At some point they have to understand that this film was about thor....not about the avengers.it's a thor solo film.marvel has made so uch money they have lost it for good.All in all this is the worst solo thor film of the three and it's a shame cause it had a great main story which unfortunately was ignored for 2/3 of the film.Grade C+

OK I know where the door is. But before I get out, let me add a couple of things.I don't remember much, but as far as I can tell, this is a second super heroes movies that the soundtrack really hit the spot, Led Zeppelin's Immigrant song is kick ass, and its really help to create perfect atmosphere while Thor kicking ass.This movie do provide more color than usual, literally, and throw a lot of comedies, showing that it's okay for a big scary dude to act dork, I'm looking at you Hulk, you're kinda cute there, you too lord of... err, god of thunder. Thor, we still like you even though you're not a strongest Avengers (that's what quinn jet says).All in all, this movie is gooood. There, 'nuf said, I'm out of here, maybe to watch it again. Or maybe later, when I'm sure I can pick a good position, rather than forced to take the last available chair."

I have given it 7/10 Pros: .Funnier than most marvel films .Amazing visuals .Thor being amazing .Fantastic fight scenes .More hulk .threat seemed more real (unlike civil war and homecoming)Cons: .Too many reminders of guardians of the galaxy like the music and planet scenery .Too much forced humour which didn't need to be thereIt was very enjoyable overall But I miss marvel movies like winter soldier and ones going back before the avengers as none relied on humour.

I'm so confused by the direction this movie took and why it (and most previously serious movies) has become a huge joke..The movie had so much potential to be unique,epic,amazing and mind blowing, but instead there had to be cringey and awkward jokes and terrible lines every few minutes. This movie was made for simple children and brainless adults who will laugh at and not question anything. Lines that dont make sense,scenes that dont jive with the rest,characters that normally would be out of place in anything but a children movie or poor quality comedy are ever present and given major roles. Its a disgrace to the genre and the series.. I will not be watching another Thor in theaters again!"
27 October 2017,derenzo229,30,60,5,bland and boring another marvel movie,Thor Ragnarok was a boring movie that had some elements that worked but more or less is forgettable my main issue with the film is its presentation but before i get into that i have to mention some elements that worked for the most part for one some visuals were interesting to look at there were some fun moments in the film the humor at times were pretty good and thee hulk and Thor plus Loki worked well together but that's where it ends for me most of the time the film is uninteresting the villain character Hella was boring cringe worthy and non threatening i mean she does kill a lot of people but the film gives me no reason to care at all the quips and jokes at times got really annoying to hear for one most marvel movies have jokes and that's fine but more less at this point the quips and jokes feel like they belong on the how to make a marvel movie check list there is a scene early in the film where Thor is narrating to the audience but they try to past it off as him talking to a skull but for me it felt cheap and lazy and finally the thing is of course presentation now most marvel movies have this problem but i gotta say that I'm getting sick of seeing marvel movies do this they frame there movies in such a boring way that it becomes hard to be interested in there are some good looking visuals in the film but they decide to film it in a boring way and marvel has no excuse for this right now they are the biggest superhero film studio in the market and no matter what people will go see these movies so why cant marvel experiment and use film making to its best ability i mean there is no threat i mean most of the competition they have aren't really that big of a threat the dc-mu are in a bad place Sony messed up with spider man i mean the only studio that might be a threat are 20th century fox i mean with dead-pool and Logan being big hits for different reasons its showing that marvel movies aren't as great but instead of taking chances and risks marvel decides to play it safe i can't really recommended this movie to anyone but the fanboys but trust me there are better movies to see than this film
28 October 2017,fandomsseven,51,91,8,The best Thor movie,Thor Ragnarok is an amazing weird well made and action parked movie. Ragnarok is definite the best Thor movie to date. The whole atmosphere of the movie is is wacky and weird but with the same Marvel feel we all love. The characters new and old really shine along with the locations and sets. The villain Hela is also great in the movie and recreation rally adds to movie as a whole whole also adding to list list of great casting choices by Marvel. To summarize Thor Ragnarok is Marvel's best Thor movie to date with its dry humour and its weird and wacky tones.

3 March 2018,john-demetriou-jd,7,11,5,Boring and unfunny (and should not even have tried to be funny),"MCU movies are getting worse. I no longer feel the urge to see them as soon as they come out. They are getting boring, repetitive and undermine the story with stupid jokes every 2 minutes (2 minutes is the maximum. Most of the ""jokes"" pop up more often than that). This is the story of RAGNAROK, the destruction of Asgard, we see Hela, goddess of death, we see Hulk we see so many in the trailer. Hoping for once that the stakes raised in the trailer will be reflected in the movie. I know there will be jokes, you can have jokes. But don't make movies like Ragnarok into a stupid comedy, and a bad comedy for that matter. 
Tired, boring with stupid jokes that I would laugh with if I was 8 years old. Start making some good movies instead of these quick money grabbing forgettable ones. Nobody will ever forget the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nobody Will ever forget Iron Man 1, Avengers 1, or Logan."
2 March 2018,Sheldonshells,8,14,1,Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies,"There's nothing here but the same formula, with a few tweaks for the mentally ill simpletons to think it's something different. To say it's ""different"" or a ""change of pace"" (which some people are) is just stupid . The fact that this is a superhero movie alone negates all possibility that there is anything remotely refreshing or different about it. The attempts at constant ""jokes"" are just obnoxious. Besides, I don't think that a movie that is in fact one big joke would be able to swallow that irony.As for the actors there's the always annoying, uninteresting, no-count lead actor who plays thor-what's his name again? lol, yeah, like that matters. A plank of wood would have more character than this no-count, who in this movie looks like he just freshly pulled his head out of some guy's crevice. As for the other ones, they could have gotten a more attractive actress to play Valkyrine (did I misspell that?), so then at least there would be something fun to look at despite the obnoxiousness of the character. All the hot musclegirls there are these days and yet they couldn't get one for this role? No excuse for that really. Same goes for Cate Blanchett who plays Hela for that matter. Hey Cate, they're called implants, look them up some time, hit the thick glutes training while you're at it. Might have made this character remotely interesting....but probably still not. Hopefully at least she'll die horribly at some point.I used to respect Jeff Goldblum more, mostly for his older roles and that respect will dissipate quickly if he keeps taking roles like the one here. Maybe he's starting to think he should have stuck with his jazz piano playing.How do these movies even make money in an age of peer-to-peer downloading or get any good reviews? I know a lot of people are basically either paid off or obliged to make fake good reviews, and I suppose the big studio and finance system takes full advantage out of the special interest group of depressed, lost, and thor-oughly butt-stuck idiocrats out there, apparently before they kill themselves, too depressed and too in a mental fugue to know what they're doing with what's left of their lives, exposing themselves to things that's probably just making them even more unhappy. Although the lack of choice presented to these poor people has much to do with all this of course. And the suicide and mass shooting rate continues to rise....Anyway, this is yet another marvel/comic book movie that would truly sully any landfill site. Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies no doubt. Another completely irrelevant movie (even irrelevant to entertainment) that already feels very old and done for."
16 September 2021,Filmdokter,12,28,8,"A crazy, crazy comedy","#MCUrewatch. It took three films to get the character and world of Thor right, but boy did director Waititi succeed (the first two were either too serious or too dark). If you thought Guardians of the Galaxy was crazy, wait until you see Ragnarok. With its 80's soundtrack and visuals it looks like a teenagers dream. The entire film is a joy (although the climax isn't as good as what came before) but especially the middle act (which takes place on the planet Sakaar) is some of the best the MCU ever delivered. Comedy genius with great performances from Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi and especially Goldblum. It is here where the director can put his auteur stamp on the film and make it one of the craziest superhero films of all time. And that is a great compliment."

The comedic timing was amazing, and I think it's up there with Guardians Vol. 2 in terms of how funny it was. The action is amazing, and Taika Waititi was the perfect director for this movie. We really didn't know we wanted him until we got him. One complaint I have is that sometimes the humor undercuts some of the serious parts of the movie, but it's not too bad."

16 March 2018,shanayneigh,4,7,2,The comedy ruined this movie,"After Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool (both movies I love) made a ton of money it's obvious that the bean counters at Marvel think that piling on jokes is the answer to making a great movie (and, of course, money). The problem with that is that the tone for this movie is way off. It's supposed to be dealing with Ragnarök, which is (very simplified) the death of gods and end of the world. Go back and watch the scenes in Avengers: Age of Ultron where Thor has a vision of Ragnarök and compare the tone in that movie with this one. You don't really feel like there's anything at stake when there's (supposedly) witty dialogue and slapstick going on in every goddamn scene. It effectively undercuts everything in the movie. But the cardinal sin is that the comedic parts aren't very funny, although I have to say that I chuckled a bit at emo teen Hulk (surely it can't be a spoiler that the Hulk shows up in this movie since he's in the trailer and on the poster?). After a while it became embarrassing to watch everyone on screen scrambling for cheap laughs. It reached its apotheosis when the sloshed Valkyrie drunkenly fell off the ramp, in a performance that would make even third rate porn actors blush.The only thing I've seen directed by Taika Waititi is (except for a few episodes of ""Conchords"") is ""What We Do in the Shadows"", which had some OK scenes and an amusing premise, but was hardly a knee-slapper. But one things that's clear is that he's no James Gunn.The most impressive thing about this movie is that it made the first two Thor movies seem pretty damn good."

And almost every scene filmed like a really bad sitcom, with awful ""What we do in the shadows"" type of improvised jokes.
They destroyed Thor (Star Lord/Chris Pratt rip off). They buried Loki. And they literally burn Asgard to ashes.
Bad movie with those few laughs and Cate Blanchett's charm and beauty salvaging another terrible Marvel villain.PD: And then, the actually ""good at their job"" Russo brothers saved Thor with IW, and with only a few minutes, they honored and used Loki way better than Dumbtiti on an entire movie."
26 October 2017,robertslipek,168,321,1,"Ugly, badly paced, thinly written, tonally uneven and worst of all: unfunny, despite its desperate attempts.","Disorienting, loud and ugly, often all at the same time, Thor: Ragnarok boasts a cast of great Marvel characters and rich mythological storytelling--but squanders its potential by being nothing more than a paint by numbers action/comedy with a tone stuck somewhere between a Michael Bay film and a bad SNL skit. What makes it worse is that every attempt at comedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the plot. The plot is thin and glossed over, and the characters... there are none. Every character in this film is doing roughly the same thing-- a bit. A comedy bit to make the audience laugh. There is no real depth or humanity to this film, just jokes and bad CGI held together with more jokes. Awful choreography and sound design and basically no camera work at all, the film is shot like its a Clerks movie and is very bland to watch. I hope director Taika Waititi keeps away from blockbusters in the future--if only to save himself from anymore embarrassment. The already weak Thor trilogy ends on its lowest low. How Marvel has fallen."

Of course, major credit goes to Chris Helmsworth and Tom Hiddleston chemistry but major surprise comes with Dr Banner aka Mark Ruffalo whose character is very well utilized in the movie. Additional amazingly cameo of witty characters played by Jeff Goldblum and Benedict Cumberbatch are fantastic to the entire scheme of the movie. Tessa Thompson looked ravishing and essayed the part well, however, Cate Blanchett at her evil best is also promising. Thor Ragnarok overall should serve as a benchmark for other forthcoming Marvel movies."
17 November 2017,rcarlin79,128,228,1,Why does anyone give this movie a good review?????,This was truly awful!!! It looked like the actors were free to make up their own dialogue. Every single scene is made to be a comedy but the humour is sadly lacking in at least 90% of it. Marvel have latched on to the comedy plaudits they receives from the first guardians of the galaxy movie and now every movie they make has to be hilarious. The action was horrible. Just a horrible backward step for comic book movies. Devastated I spent money to go and see it.
3 November 2017,gabiirrs,19,32,3,'How did this happen?' Superheroes become a joke...,"Ragnarök is the ultimate Nordic battle and the last movie we will see before Infinity War, therefore I was expecting something a little bit more apocalyptic.From the first scene to the very last one everything is a joke, I know MCU likes to make the movies a little kid-friendly with a comic relief, but Thor Ragnarok is way over the top. The movie is full with sad moments, a bunch of them, I couldn't take any of them seriously because the jokes would not stop. Because everything is a joke there's no tension at any point, the main character doesn't grow or learns anything new, and the villain is never something you actually worry about, the plot becomes flat and boring. Hela, played by the amazing Cate Blanchett, is a waste of character, she does it beautifully, as far as she can, but doesn't make a villain you will remember. The friendship between Thor and Hulk doesn't go to a really deep level; and the brotherly Thor-Loki relationship is so predictable that it just plain dull.What I'm most worried about is that this will set a new trend for the new Marvel movies, where superheroes can't be taken seriously because they make a joke out of it. Most heroes have a dark past that makes them who they are, MCU had done an incredibly work till this year, with Spiderman-Homecoming, but specially Thor Ragnarok, a movie that had such a potential but it turned out being a joke, literally. Apparently Marvel is more concerned about making a movie that will make you chuckle for a couple of hours instead of making a movie with a deep story that'll make you say ""I can't wait for the next Marvel movie!"".Now we just have to wait and hope the best for Infinity War."
23 February 2020,btreakle,3,5,10,Marvel realms,I am a true fan of Marvel Stan Lee. I think Thor Ragnarok what is the best Marvel movie I've seen them quite a while.

8 April 2022,boblipton,2,3,8,Creatures Of Light And Darkness,"One of the things I enjoyed about Roger Zelazny's well-written revenge dramas was the unspoken attitude of his characters. ""Yes,"" they would seem to say, ""I'm a god. Who isn't?"" This gave them the opportunity to behave in ways appropriate to gods to anyone who have read much mythology, id est, completely and casually inappropriately.That was the fun in this movie, in which there is more of Thor's Smothers-Brothers relationship with Loki, mixed feelings with the Hulk (""It's fine, I know him from work""). It's well put together, breezy and the set pieces of rock-em-sock-em robots are not too onerous: the well-oiled Marvel Movie machine at work."

15 March 2020,fernandoschiavi,3,5,8,The director delivers a true action comedy. What Taika Waititi does with Thor: Ragnarok? It shatters all those hopes in the most hilarious way possible.,"Thor is one of the icons of the Marvel shared universe, being the second hero presented by Marvel, in a first film with a good dose between humor and family conflicts. His sequence was better in terms of action, but it was marked by having an uninspired script, a much more somber tone and a disappointing villain. Since then, the Thunder God has participated in the first two Avengers and has not won another adventure as a protagonist, until now. This third film of the hero brings a completely new tone and is free to not worry about practically not maintaining connections with Earth's plots, being able to plunge headlong into the development of this cosmic world, with extreme freedom and courage.For this new phase 3 adventure, Marvel Studios hired New Zealand director Taika Watiti, from the great What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Rick Baker's Amazing Adventure (2016), which focus on comedy and achieve excellent results. The director does not act as a screenwriter on this project, but has a direct influence on the creative decisions of the direction of the text created by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost, absurdly raising the initial potential of the story.
Here, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is trapped on the other side of the universe. He must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarok, the destruction of his world, which is in the hands of the powerful and relentless villain Hela (Cate Blanchett).
The plot begins with Thor explaining to the viewer that after the events of 'Age of Ultron', he went through the universe in search of the Jewels of Infinity, but found none. Then he went on a journey of death and destruction until he found himself in the cave of the fire demon Surtur. Right in these first sequences, we can notice the style of jokes much more acid and, still a brief explanation of what the Ragnarok was about. We still see an incredible action sequence between Thor and Sutur and dozens of his followers. The action, jokes and boldness in the camera frames would be just a prelude to the whole rhythm of the two hours ahead. It's ten minutes that already leaves the viewer waiting for a unique experience.We also have Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) when the brothers Thor and Loki come to Earth in search of their father, Odin. This scene is an extended version of the one shown in the credits of Doctor Strange (2016) and it is excellent to see the interaction of the brothers with the Doctor showing their magical exploits in a more than special participation. In this part of the brothers on Earth we also learn that the relationship between Thor and Jane is over and we see the brothers' final encounter with Odin, who reveals that he has a firstborn, Hela, the Goddess of Death, who is arriving after his imminent death, to cause Ragnarok (end of Asgard, end of time).After a confrontation between the brothers and Hela, we see that Thor ends up in Sakaar where he is captured by a waste picker (Tessa Thompson) who was, in the past, a Valkyrie - an elite force of warriors from Asgard. There, he meets the Grand Master (Jeff Goldblum), a creator of Sakaar and the tournament of champions. The actor is one of the great successes of the film with his slow pace of speech and the joking treatment he has with everyone around him makes the character remarkable. We still have Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), of the Kronan race, another great comic highlight. All the grandeur of the character combined with the calm voice and accent of the production director, who also lends a voice to the character, are part of the most hilarious scenes in the production.One of the main moments in the feature is the Tournament of Champions, which Thor is obliged to participate in and beat the champion of the Grand Master to gain freedom. That's when he finds out that the champion everyone is referring to is the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). With the confirmation of the Hulk, elements of the story arc of the ""Planet Hulk"" comics were adapted for Ragnarok. The fight between them in the arena and the subsequent interactions between them is formidable, where Hulk, this time, is more evolved being able to think and is able to hold a conversation, although he is still angry all the time. When Hulk turns into Bruce Banner, the fun gets even bigger. Finally, Mark Ruffalo has a chance to have plenty of space on the scene and shines like Hulk and Banner, being responsible for sharp dialogues and priceless scenes.One of the dynamics that works most is the interaction between the members of the new group of ""avengers"" formed by Thor, Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk, who come together to try to save Asgard from Ragnarok. The whole phase of adapting to the new reality, forced exile and the complete lack of perspective on returning and defending the kingdom is marked by good humor. Nobody philosophizes, nobody questions their own nature. Everyone is there for the journey, for the joke, for the entertainment. Without the burden of questioning or developing concepts, Ragnarok allows himself to make mistakes and get it right - in obscene, childish, sarcastic or long jokes, in casting choices and even in exaggerated looks. Speaking of visual, Sakaar's construction - where more than half of the plot takes place - is as bold as the visuals of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' planets and galaxies. The city is different, colorful, modern, high tech, rustic, wild, chaotic and lawless, all at the same time. There, we can still see several different races and the most different and curious beings. The visual conception of that place as a whole is deliberately exaggerated and daring, which is not a problem. High tech luminous weapons, spaceships and air chase scenes are pure fun and bring many references from the 'Star Wars' saga, which is a delight for those who love the most genuine science fiction. Visually, Watiti paid tribute to ""King"" Jack Kirby. The director, along with the production design team, used and abused straight lines, geometric symbols and hypersaturated colors.In Asgard, Thor and his newly formed team star in incredible scenes against the army and the giant wolf Fenris reborn by the Eternal Flames, highlighting the fight between Hulk and Fenris and the rebirth of Surtur to fulfill the prophecy. The whole final part is grand and exciting, but the film also has flaws. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. II finds the ideal balance between weight and lightness, Thor: Ragnarok is in a questionable back-and-forth. The emergence of Hela (Cate Blancett) is not necessarily problematic - the threat is felt and Blancett's choice was right - but there remains the constant sensation of two films completely different from one another, packaged in a single production. The narrative ties of one block to another could have been better resolved. Asgard is the scene of the dominion of the Goddess of Death over a people on the verge of extinction. Without any of that, Sakaar is ... indescribable.Also drinking from the adventures of the galactic team, Ragnarok brings pop songs on his soundtrack, masterfully fitting Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" in two scenes and ""In the Face of Evil"" by the synthwave group Magic Sword. Taika Watiti proves to be one of the most creative minds in Hollywood and adds features still unheard of in the arc of Thor's story, being definitely the best in the hero's trilogy. The director delivers a true action comedy, supported by the great supporting cast. The fans therefore yearned for a work worthy of being featured in Odin's son. An epic about Norse mythology, with great battles, huge armies and a lot of seriousness. What does Taika Waititi do with Thor: Ragnarok? It shatters all those hopes in the most hilarious way possible."
7 November 2017,msmith-56,12,22,8,Comic Book on Film,"I know, both 'Comic Book' and 'Film' seem out of date, but this movie may be the index case for the 21st century version of merging both. Ragnarok seemed to capture the cocky adolescence of traditional comic books while delivering the big screen visuals one expects from a theater film. The acting was slightly better than most superhero films, too. Benedict Cumberbatch's Dr. Strange cameo was well done. Chris Hemsworth was much funnier than in Ghostbusters. Even Kate Blanchett's character showed some texture and pathos in spite of her limited appearances. Humor was well placed, and special effects were first class. The music and sound effects were both better orchestrated and less intrusive that usual.On the unseemly side, Anthony Hopkins did seem to phone in his limited role, Mark Ruffalo seemed to have been dragged into his role, and Karl Urban seemed underused. As for the plot, this is a comic book story.BTW, stay for all the credits."
2 August 2020,csliger931,8,14,10,Best superhero movie out there,"I'm not much into comic-book/superhero movies. They just aren't my thing. So when I say that Thor:Ragnarok is a fantastic movie, know that it's an unbiased assessment. This movie is very fun with lots of action and humor, the acting is fantastic, the pacing is great, etc. I can't really say anything negative about it."
8 March 2019,Benjamin-M-Weilert,3,5,7,An entertaining setup for greater things to come.,"At this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), I feel these movies are practically on autopilot. Because Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) were absent from Captain America: Civil War (2016), there had to be a movie to explain what they were doing during that timeframe. Consequently, while Civil War had great conflict and an epic battle sequence, Thor: Ragnarok (2017) feels . . . less necessary. This being said, I do think that Ragnarok explores the Thor universe better than Thor: The Dark World (2013) did, thus making me wonder if Dark World was truly the unnecessary film.Sure, there are little snippets here and there in these films that set up other parts of the franchise (mainly, the Infinity Stones that will lead to Avengers: The Infinity War (2018)), as well as minor cameos that are fun, if not wholly filler (Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in the case of Ragnarok). All Ragnarok seems to do is set the stage for the next big film in the franchise. That's not to say it's not fun and entertaining. There is plenty that Thor: Ragnarok has going for it, that's for sure. At the very least, it probably won't be relegated to a two-minute play put on for Asgardian royalty.While being bright and colorful, there were still enough moments of character development that concluded in a flashy spectacle. Where Dark World brought humans to Asgard, thus necessitating Thor's eventual return to Earth, Ragnarok explored the universe connected to Asgard in a way that helped to develop the MCU. The humor in Ragnarok was also on point, with Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster and Taika Waititi's Korg being some of the best dialogue in the film. I also enjoyed the minor cameos of Liam Hemsworth and Matt Damon in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment.An entertaining setup for greater things to come, I give Thor: Ragnarok 3.5 stars out of 5."
15 September 2021,PedroPires90,12,32,8,Best Thor,"The quality is here: great production values and great acting by everybody, especially surprised by the supporting acts. It works as a comedy film even if it's weird to put him on the context of the previous films. A bit overpopulated, too many comedy elementos and too much chat during inappropriate moments (usual on MCU films) but overall this a good film and the best Thor."
21 January 2018,CriticismHurts,5,7,5,Marvel movies are now comedies...,"So it seems that most people like cheap comedy in their super hero films thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy. Hollywood has taken notice. And now all future Marvel movies will be comedies. Oh Joy...This movie killed this character and anticipation for future Marvel super hero movies for me. If I wanted to watch a comedy, I'd watch one. Marvel characters shouldn't be this obnoxious on screen."
31 October 2017,halcyon_king,47,87,9,Jackpot!,"Every time I go into the movies I feel like playing the lottery. I hope for the best but really don't know what I'm getting and I often feel disappointed in the end. This time it was not the case. Marvel universe movies have been my favorites from the very beginning of the story and Thor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. I was hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this was on another level entirely. This movie is fun, funny, full of action, well acted, fits the story perfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It is different from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly on its own while still being a bridge to the culmination of the Marvel universe. It's light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the final chapters of the Marvel universe which are no doubt going to be much darker and more dramatic. But make no mistake Thor Ragnarok is a serious movie with a thin layer of drama and darkness as well. It's not perfect but it's flaws are tiny and barely noticeable when compared to the big picture. Without a doubt in my top 3 Marvel movies for now."
22 January 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,5,11,8,Too much infantile humor overshadows the decent VFX,"I always enjoy some humor in my action flicks but this was way overdone. Worse, is that it was infantile humor that seemed to be aimed at 10 year olds. The VFX were decent and the story was ok. Not one of my favorite films of the franchise but still enjoyable. Would I see it again or recommend it? Probably not. 7/10 from me."

2 November 2017,Prismark10,10,29,6,Hippy Hippy Thor,"Thor was always a tricky comic book character to bring to big screen. Kenneth Branagh managed to do it by making the first film as a mock Shakespearean action film fuelled by dysfunctional family dynamics. He was instrumental in casting Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Unfortunately Thor:The Dark World was rather dreary. Marvel has taken a left turn for Thor: Ragnarok by getting inspiration from The Guardians of the Galaxy film by underpinning the film with comedy.King Odin has been sent to a nursing home on Earth by Loki who has pretended to be Odin at Asgard. Thankfully Doctor Strange felt Odin would be more at home in Norway.When Thor returns to Asgard he sees through Loki's disguise. When they go to meet a dying Odin, he tells both of an evil older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett) who will return and cause chaos.Thor:Ragnarok is a rather trippy neon lit 1980s infused adventure film. In some ways it nods a hat to movies like Big Trouble in Little China.Thor is both aided and thwarted by evil brother Loki who sees Thor getting a painful bashing that he endured in the hands of the Hulk who is the main star in a planet where beings take part in a gladiatorial contest.It is Asgard and some of the regulars from there who get short shrift, characters such as Heimdall. Karl Urban who plays Hela's henchman called Skurge is rather wasted of his talents as we know he is capable of giving much more. Even Blanchett is rather bland as the villainess, Hela. In some ways the film is rather dark and brutal but it is always undercut by the comedy."
23 February 2018,novatone,9,16,1,Ragna wrong,"Oh dear oh dear oh dear.Where to start?Well, Thor 1 and Thor 2 were great. Loved those films - as someone previously said - the humour had a place in those films. It was all referential to an individual in an unknown place and out of their depth - and most crucially it was Thor being a dufus and the rest of the world around him playing the 'straight man'.Now - since Guardians Of The Galaxy was 'apparently' so good - they've gone to town on the funnies, and the plot or any believable emotional response to any event in the film takes a distant back seat. The result is a boring, unenfaging film. Not to mention confusing.I'm writing this film as Thor is sitting down talking to the hulk about fire. That's a scene almost exactly half way through the film. I haven't seen 50% of this garbage film yet and i'm Already bored and writing a review. Wow. Hopefully it will save some else the £9.99 Of wastes earnings buying it. Yes BUYING it. Marvel Studios don't even want to let me rent this utter trash.I could write more but the longer my review is, then the more of this film I have to watch.Forget Thor - in fact forget Marvel Studios, because they don't even understand their own films.Awful. 1 Star. Avoid"
25 January 2018,pereiradorogerio,8,13,2,I hope they don't make more Thor movies,"Well this was an huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting infantile jokes, the nuisance of having to suffer with that stupid jerk Jeff Goldblum character, plus the one paper thick argument, full of imbecility in all the wrong places. I'm giving it a 2 because of the CGI, the Dr. Strange sequence and... nothing else really. This is probably the most overrated movie of the year. I can tell you right away that the DC Comics movie, ""League of Justice"" is way much better than this Marvel utter crap. I just hope that Marvel gets back on its track and PLEASE NO MORE THOR MOVIES!!! I'm pretty sure if we all wanted a patched eye Thor behaving like Captain Jack Sparrow, being a childish character the whole movie, we would have Marvel cast Johnny Depp for the part instead of totally ruining Chris Hemsworth previous Thor movies. Now it's ""forget about it!"" because Marvel can't get back at making more Thor movies with this Chris Hemsworth guy again... Get another actor for the part because this one is ruined forever. You kind of almost ruined Hulk too but I'll leave that for the future. Maybe Hulk is still salvageable... Well Marvel I think you deserve the prize for the most childish, idiotic and worst movie of the year. Now if you excuse I'm gonna watch Lego Ninjago. I'm totally sure it will be so much better."
5 November 2017,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,6,11,8,The most crazy and fun Thor movie you will ever see.,"The Thor films have never really been the standouts in the MCU slate (at least by my opinion). I have always felt they have only ever existed to expand the scope of the MCU from global to cosmic but have been afraid of fully embracing the weird sci-fi/Lord of the Rings element. This Thor movie unapologetically embraces the weirdness and subverts what you would expect.New Zealand director of Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in The Shadows, Taikai Waititi and star Chris Hemsworth completely reinvent the mythology of the Asgardian god and have fun with it. The story of Ragnarok basically tears away everything that we've known about Thor and rebuilds his identity similar to what Winter Soldier did with Captain America. The way Waititi treats the mythology is that either there is a meta-type of humour to acknowledge the past two Thor films or it reveals dark secrets that questions what Odin and Asgard stand for. Some may feel bothered by how Waititi treats some characters depending if you somehow liked the past two Thor films.Another divisive thing is the humour. I for one am a big Waititi fan and thought his sense of humour was a nice change of pace compared to some of the forced comedy in past Marvel movies. A lot of it revolves around the fun awkward moments the characters have with one another. The humour may be a bit weird and twisted, and does come unexpectedly at some serious moments in the film but I felt that Waititi still hit the mark in understanding Thor's own personal struggle. I will say there were a lot of times this felt more like Waitti made a sci-fi fantasy comedy then a Marvel movie. That could be a good or bad depending on whom you ask.This is definitely the best Hemsworth has been in the role as Thor thanks to Waititi letting him show his comedic sense of humour rather then just rely on him seriously brooding for most of the time. Hemsworth and Waititi are aware of Thor's thick-headedness, pride and ego so they just go for it to show how flawed and insecure the character really is. And it still allows Thor to grow out from his comfort zone once his hammer gets destroyed to become a better defined character.There are great characters that Thor interacts with that are lot more unique and well-defined compared to Jane Foster (no offense to Natalie Portman). With elements of Planet Hulk thrown in, Hulk for the first time feels like a full character rather then just a piece of Bruce Banner's personality. On Sakaar, Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo in mo-cap) now is this semi-intelligent, childish celebrity who challenges Thor's masculinity but also relates to his insecurity. Tom Hiddleston once again is great as Loki who this time is no longer scheming a master plan but just trying to make the best of the situation he is unfortunately in. The big scene-stealer in this is Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, the fallen warrior turned bounty hunter. Thompson just owns the role without resorting to being a bland female sidekick. The character can come in and challenge someone's masculinity and status of power but still have enough vulnerability where we learn that she remains on Sakaar as a form of escape from her own personal demons. Also her alcoholic drinking capabilities would be one to challenge Tony Stark. And what can I say about Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster. It's Jeff Goldblum being himself as a powerful tyrant on an alien world and it's perfect. Couldn't ask for anything more. The one character I didn't unfortunately really connect to and is a problem that Marvel still refuses to fix (If you don't count Micheal Keaton's Vutlure) is the villain Hela. She does feel more intimidating and dangerous then most MCU villains but is very one-note in her goals. Cate Blanchett's performance does elevates this one-dimensional character with some fun but most of her scenes are just giving exposition to Karl Urban's Skurge and creating another faceless army of monsters for the hero to fight. Other great hilarious performances are from Waititi himself playing a cgi rock warrior version of himself called Korg and surprisingly Urban is also pretty funny as well.The look of the alien garbage world Sakaar is just breathtaking to look at from the oceans littered with fallen spacecrafts to the brightly coloured, abstract cities. Waititi's use of colour makes this Thor movie feel more bright and lively. With a lot of the action and the fun character banter happening on that world, when the film cuts back to Asgard I felt the pace slowing down and became less exciting. But it does make up for it in the final battle when Thor and his new team (delightfully called the Revengers) arrive and the stakes for Asgard are raised. And this leads to some big-changing events that put Thor on his path to Infinity War.Overall Thor: Ragnarok may not be the Marvel movie for everyone but is for sure the best and most fun we have gotten out of Thor and will surely be a treat for anyone who is a fan of Taika Waititi."

If the film had been played straight it might have managed it, but only might. It is the script that is the real villain of the piece, and if there is any justice at all, the script writer should have his keyboard shoved where the sun doesn't shine.
Marvel have decimated Spiderman, and now Thor. I have no idea what they are doing, but I am likely to stop watching soon if they don't get back on track.
This film is toe-curlingly awful, on a par, if not actually outdoing, The Amazing Spiderman 2.
I'm actually angry that it's so bad."
8 April 2020,tommyclemeno-55407,5,6,10,People are missing the point of this movie,"A lot of negetive comments here are toward the idea that this was too ""pre-teen"" or too close to a straight comedy. You need to remember, this came out during a time where basically every Marvel movie was serious. I honestly liked that broke up the monotany (especially since most Thor movies were serious) and they made this comical, but at the same time kept the Marvel element. It was very refreshing and new, especially having a cast that doesn't normally do comedy and pulling it off extremely well . I absolutely enjoyed it."
23 January 2018,charliegeeza,3,4,5,Falls short of the myths and comics it portrays,"Planet Hulk is a good individual film. Yes, it is a cartoon, but despite this it is a much deeper film than Thor Ragnorak, which takes elements of Planet Hulk and stitches them into the Thor movie franchise whilst dispensing with all the bits that made sense.For example, Jeff Goldblum portrays a dictator who acts like an awkard idiot in a bar. They try to show how ruthless he is by having him melt somebody with a 'melty stick' (a term he actually uses) but even that exchange itself is goofy. More or less the entire film makes as much sense, because more or less everything in the film is used for comedic purposes. They've seen the success of Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy and tried to turn Chris Hemsworth's Thor into a similar joke laden jack the lad hero... except he's supposed to be the God of Thunder. He literally cries over his hair being cut FFS.There's a point at which you see a topless Thor / Chris Hemsworth getting off the floor. He's got a lot of muscle. However, anybody who knows anything about actual practical strength - anybody that watches or trains MMA for example - will see something off in his proportions. Giant pecks, thin neck, for example. It's all show muscle, stuff done with reps in the gym and not stuff done for a purpose other than to look good. That's what Thor Ragnorok is. Instead of doing things in proportion, and doing things for a purpose such as developing the plot and characters, the whole film is geared towards childish humour or CGI action or a combination of both.If you can switch off completely then you'll probably enjoy it. If you watch more than a moderate number of films then you'll find yourself rolling your eyes more than smiling at the rather forced humour."
5 November 2017,maradiamantidou,265,528,1,Just a disgrace,"I can't even begin to describe what kind of trash Thor: Ragnarok was. It was a disgrace for everything we love from the Marvel comics, and the death of our hopes that some day we will see the God of Thunder in the movie he deserves. You will probably like this movie if you are only interesting in stupid jokes and ridiculous situations. Don't see this movie if you actually expect to see epic battles with Valkeries, Fenrir eating all that remains, Loki bringing death to Asgard, the Midgard Serpent in mortal battle with Thor because... none of that happened."

I didn't like the first 2 Thor movies that much and this is obviously the best one so far and probably one of the best mcu movies. Taika Waititi did a really good job both directing and voicing the funniest character in mcu history probably. His character Korg was probably the funniest character in the movie, his lines were hilarious,he had the funniest accent ever probably. And all the characters were really good. Hela is probably my favorite mcu villain right now. Cate Blanchett is really good in this movie, she is really sexy, funny and intimidating and her little fight with the Asgardians was really fun and cool. Chris Hemsworth was also really good in this he was really funny and had more character to him compared to the other Thor movies. Jeff Goldblum was awesome in the movie. Karl Urban was really good (I couldn't realize him in his character). Tessa Thompson was great. Tom Hiddleston, Mark Rufallo and Idris Elba were great as always. This movie had a basic plot and story that was just fun. Also this movie was visually stunning (not BR2049 stunning but very pleasing in that regard. Had really cool set pieces and action. Soundtrack was also really pleasing with its synth wave-y 80's feel and pretty much the whole movie had the 80's feel with neon color usage. I don't have much problems with it and I definitely would recommend seeing this movie if you have the time."

Every single scene contains CGI - lots of it!! And what is Doctor Strange doing here? Doesn't he have is own movie? I hate it when characters cross over into other films (like The Avengers, Justice League, Iron Man popping up in Spider-Man and so many other superhero movies...yawn...).'Thor: Ragnarok' is so fantastical, illogical and far-fetched - and that darn slapstick!!! - that I could only manage 30 minutes before hitting the STOP button. (How did I actually last that long??). It is very rare for me to dislike a movie to such an extent that I don't finish it. As a result I can't comment on the film in its entirety, but decided to do the review for reference purpose. From what I heard, the ENTIRE film is slapstick. Ugh, don't think I'll ever continue watching this..."
6 November 2017,jpachar82,10,22,10,The Thunder Rolls,"Welcome to the new and approved Asgard, or as I like to call it: The Revenge of an Angry Sibling. Let's rewind back to 2011 when we were first introduced to the God of Thunder. Thor, the crown prince of Asgard, has a sibling rivalry with his brother Loki over the rights to the throne and the birthright to become better brothers. You know the saying, ""All that ends well, ends well."" Not in this case ""Not all that ends well, doesn't end well."" Then we come to 2013, when all hope was almost seen as lost. When the dark forces of a foe that they thought was almost diminished, got stronger through a black mass that almost destroyed what Thor almost hold dear to his heart.Now we come to the mother of all, the impending doom of Asgard when someone from the past comes back unbeknownst to Thor and Loki – a woman from the past seeks revenge on the city and all that Thor and Loki could do to save their city is to, well, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say this Hela, played beautifully and menacing by the talented Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, did an incredible job.Ragnarok was awesome. It was adventurous, dangerous, comedic. I thoroughly enjoyed. Stay tuned though because this movie is vital to the upcoming next Avengers movie. Not saying anymore."
9 June 2018,paul_haakonsen,5,12,6,Fun and entertaining for what it was...,"Granted that I am not much fan of superhero movies, but I still do take the time to sit down to watch them when I get a chance for the sheer entertainment of it being a well-produced movie.And true to the Marvel formula, then ""Thor: Ragnarok"" doesn't stray for the established blueprint that Marvel seem to use again and again. So if that is a good or bad thing is entirely up to the viewer. But let's just say that you at least know exactly what you are getting into here.The visual effects in this movie were fantastic, as they usually are in Marvel movies, and that is definitely one of the supporting pillars that keep the movie afloat. The acting was good taking into consideration the genre of the movie.There was a new level of humor and comedy introduced in this movie in the franchise, and again whether or not you like that or find it suitable for the genre is individual. Personally, I think it was okay because it gave a fresh breath of air to the superhero genre and it wasn't all about taking itself serious and being self-righteous.The storyline was fairly good, although rather predictable, as they usually are in the superhero genre.If you enjoy the Marvel universe, then chances are that you will enjoy this adrenaline-filled movie."
16 September 2021,Safetylight,12,27,8,Ages well. I wasn't impressed when I first saw it. But 4 years on... loved it!,"In the larger context of the other films, where you already know the characters well, when you already know what will happen next, this really works. I'm not entirely sure why, but there it is.I was riveted the whole (second) time.What a weird phenomenon. Age of Ultron is also remarkable in this way."
17 November 2017,monteiroaron,179,351,1,"Embarrassing, Terrible, Awful. Total Trash.","I was with high spectations that Marvel would do the perfect Thor movie, with Ragnarok background story. My mistake was to believe in this. This movie has nothing to offer, other than silly and not-even-a-bit funny ""jokes'. Its like Taika was drunken and write the movie while being kissed by a horse, or a giant flying metal alien whale (Avengers one). There are no good fight/action. There are no chemistry between the characters. The ""journey"" take them from A to A: they don't go anywhere with this. Hulk seems like a Marvel version of Shrek, from Dreamworks. Its the worst CGI I have seen so far, and I saw Sharknado. The movie could be called ""Trash"" instead of ""Thor. You want to know about Hela? Which Hela? She has only a few minutes on screen, acting more like Rita Repulsa from Power Rangers than the GOd of Death itself. Shamefull. Embarrassing (Again). Sic. MY EYES ARE BURNING! I'm seriously thinking about start a judicial process against Marvel/Disney for that great trash."
15 April 2020,cassandrabeetschen,3,3,9,Best Marvel Movie,"Thor: Ragnarok is probably my favorite Marvel movie. I had low expectations and wasn't particularly excited to see it (I normally get way too excited about new Marvel releases).... So I was expecting it to be ""eh.""
I was so freaking thrilled when I watched it for the first time on Netflix and it grabbed my attention immediately! The movie continued to deliver a fun, light-hearted viewing experience.
I know most other people's critiques about the movie are centered around the amount of humor and suggesting that it came off as a movie that's trying to hard to be funny..... I 100% disagree with these criticisms!
I love the humor in this movie! I think Marvel Studios created something unique (in comparison to their other releases) and I appreciate the overall laid-backness of the film.
I'm not much of a movie person, don't have the attention span or commitment skills for most films..... So I appreciate movies like this one; That I can enjoy and want to watch again after I've seen it a dozen times already.Great visuals, good storyline, fantastic amount of comedy, and perfect pace."
27 October 2017,pkbutler2012,37,75,3,"Ragnarok no, Disney crap yes","Ragnarok should have been epic. Instead it overreaches with annoying, pathetic attempts at humor clearly intended for a 12-year-old audience. I loved the first Guardians but felt the sequel was horrifically flat by comparison. Guardians II is a masterpiece comparatively.Echoing others, the 10/10s reviews must originate from studio/corporate minions meant to boost the ratings rather than from genuine IMDb contributors. Time for a change in the way reviews are published."
31 October 2017,bat_manfan39,43,77,8,My Thoughts On The New Thor,"The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against the Hulk his former ally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home and the Asgardian civilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had to say that because it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say that to me the story was really well told and really well paced which is to be expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.Returning as New Doug (if you don't get the joke then watch the film) is Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston , Cate Blanchett , Idris Elba , Jeff uh ah uh ah uh ah Goldblum , Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. I have to admit i loved the chemistry between Chris and Tom at this point they might as well be brothers and the same goes for Chris and Mark i'd say the only one that Chris doesn't have chemistry with is someone i can't mention since it's spoiler. The rest of the cast do a solid job i know we make a lot of fun about Jeff Goldblum but damn he was good in this film you can tell that he was having a blast playing this character and i hope to god that we get to see more of him in future movies and once again Tessa kills it i loved her in Creed and i love her in this i'm calling it right now she's going to win a lot of awards.It's taken them awhile but finally Marvel have created another great villain at least in my eyes Hela was a true badass. The only real gripe i have with her is more personal then anything and that's the fact her motivation wasn't that clear others might think the opposite but that's my opinion and she can actually beat people up and be an actual challenge for our hero and i hated her helmet.Wow this film has a lot of humor and i do expect a lot of it to go over people's heads especially with the music choices but this film had me laughing out loud and hard we all know of the scene where Thor and Hulk first meet up and that's still funny but for me one of the best jokes in the movie is what happens after that scene and if you've seen the first Avengers movie you'll know why i laughed at that scene.Honestly at this point there's no point in my even talking about the CGI because we all know it's going to be good so instead i'll jump right into the action which honestly was rather refreshing just due to the fact that not a lot of it boiled down to who can hit who the hardest and there's a badass scene with Thor near the end of movie which i was going to make a joke about but then i thought it might be a spoiler.Damn the soundtrack for this film is really something and when i say the soundtrack i don't mean the score used by composer Mark Mothersbaugh.i mean the songs they inserted into the film i kid you not one of the scenes uses ""Pure Imagination"" from Willy Wonka while not one but two action scenes use ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin and i was OK with that.Overall i can't say this is the best Marvel movie because i think there are better movies but i can safely say that this is the best Thor movie and the best Hulk movie for me this film gets an 8.5 out of 10."
28 January 2018,elabat,8,13,3,Garbage,"Piece of garbage.
I feel i just watched a movie that has nothing to do with the two others..
We never know if it has been written for 6 years old, or moron adults.
Dialog is bad, jokes not very subtle. What a waste ! Waste of talents like Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum..
We never care for anyone, we just have pure action all the time.
It's like if they said ""Let's mix Guardians of the galaxy spirit with Thor and we will have some goo money to do.."

If you want to watch a movie produced by Disney hags and orchestrated solely around 8 year olds followed by a false Thor sitting around making comic gestures and throwing one-liners then this is the movie for you. If you want any sort of plot or remotely believable Norse mythology-related scenes, pick a different movie.You have been warned."
6 November 2017,jgeorge4,10,21,9,It's Safe To Go Back In The Theater...,"In recent reviews, I've called attention to the fact that 2017 has been a pretty dismal year for movies. Recently, I've seen ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Logan Lucky,"" and ""Blade Runner."" What do these three seemingly disparate movies have in common? They all received outstanding reviews across the board, and all three were TERRIBLE.I was certainly beginning to lose faith in this whole ""Hollywood"" thing and this whole ""paying $40 for my family to watch a crappy movie when we could be home watching NETFLIX"" thing. Fear not, movie-lovers. As usual, Marvel has delivered the goods.""Ragnarok"" is the vehicle that will elevate Hemsworth from a star to a hyper-star. He is simply electrifying, and the movie is loads of fun. My only complaint is I wish they didn't use El Grande Verde in the marketing material. It would have been even better if his appearance was a complete surprise, which obviously it was not.Bottom line, Marvel is just running circles around the rest of Hollywood. If you have been burned by the appallingly lousy movies of 2017, set your fears aside and go see Ragnarok. You will love it."
19 October 2017,denizcimen,184,366,10,How could they manage to do this?WOW,"First of all I wanna say,Hela is amazing.Best villain I ve ever seen since the Joker(Of course not the God awful joker from s.squad.The joker from dark knight)Action scenes were so incredible.Fenrir,Surtur,Hela,Sakaar,Hulk,Thor, Gladiator-battle arena,demolition of Asgard etc..so damn epic.I am glad they put comedy on this last Thor movie cause the Thor 1 and 2 were all serious movies,especially Thor was a serious character.This didn't work out so they tried to make a funnier,more entertaining movie.In my opinion it was a great move.Cause there were so many emotional moments and deaths in this movie.Btw,be ready for very surprising deaths and cameos.I didn't mind the comedy cause they put all the jokes in right places.Just like they did in Guardians of the Galaxy,Ant man and FOX did in Deadpool.Also I am not allergic to comedy or having fun if they make it right.I am not one of those moody,goth/emo,depressing people with boring,dull life.I am very satisfied with this movie.Now it is time for JUSTICE LEAGUE.I really hope that movie will be great too. I liked WONDER WOMAN a lot,hope J.L will be as good as that."
8 April 2018,SnoopyStyle,10,31,8,flawless fun,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns home to find Loki (Tom Hiddleston) ruling Asgard disguised as their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Before dying, Odin reveals a previously unknown elder daughter Hela (Cate Blanchett) and warns against an impending Asgardian doomsday prophesy called Ragnarok. With Odin's death, Hela is released and Loki's carelessness allows her to return to Asgard. She destroys Thor's hammer and relegates the brothers to the planet Sakaar. Scrapper 142 (Tessa Thompson) takes Thor prisoner and sells him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) for his gladiatorial contests. Thor is surprised to find the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) as the champion.This is fun. In fact, it's flawless fun. It's light, funny, action-packed, and fun-fun-fun. The Asgardian brothers continue to have good chemistry but the best bromance has to be Hulk and Thor. That is Hulk in both Hulk form and Banner form. These two are the new buddy comedy duo of Marvel. They are hilarious together and has the best section of the movie. I only wish for more Hulk Thor pairing. Tessa Thompson is a great addition. Jeff Goldblum does his Jeff Goldblumiest. Hela is the only one who may need more dimensions. She's a bit of a cardboard cut out villain and Blanchett does her best with what she's allowed to do. She needs a scene by herself to add some dimension and lay down some Shakespear on her father's spirit. That's often the case for Marvel villains. Director Taika Waititi really let his unique skills loose on this franchise."
6 May 2018,invisibleunicornninja,1,1,10,Easily the best Thor movie.,"This movie is so entertaining I'm a bit shocked by all the bad reviews. Sure its a comedy, but most superhero movies are comedies nowadays. At least most of the jokes work with the plot and are actually funny. There isn't really anything to complain about here. The characters are entertaining. The story is clever and fun. The effects are incredible. During the other Thor movies I wanted the people responsible to suffer. During this one I never wanted it to end. Nothing about this movie doesn't work, and that's mostly down to the director. I've watched other movies that he's made and they're all great. I highly recommend this movie, especially to fans of Marvel."

20 May 2019,aminifatimaaa,3,5,9,phenomenally entertaining with bedazzling action,"Thor: Ragnarok is a hilarious, heartfelt action epic, the film boasts the personality, character, and color needed to create a masterpiece. The film distinguishes itself with heady themes and presents all of this with a tone that leans towards comedy. The action film is bright and hillarious at times, but it never forgets the darkness of its violence or the heat of its heart. The cast were excellent and created very memorable performances. Thor: Ragnarok is a electric and deliciously entertaining film that allows its audience to have a glorious experience."
24 February 2018,dogonlion,7,15,1,Worse super hero movie!,"What a rip off this movie is? They used the title Thor to make a cheap version of the series. People gave it good reviews because of the basic humour... Really, I love a good comedy but Thor is not where i would try to find it. I would rather watch Dumb and Dumber over and over. Hulk acting like a baby, playing with a bouncing ball... Thor throwing a ball at a window only to have the ball ricochet back and hit him in the face to knock him flat? What is this?
Thor's hammer seems so light and fake. The movie sets look like Sesame Street. Wood panels cheaply painted with a bunch of bright colors. The costumes are ridiculous. The CGI is the worse, the special effects don't even try to seem realistic. Nowadays I can do better with an iPhone. Cate Blanchett is too good an actress for her role. 
The only character that brings back the usual Thor vibe is Idris Elba as Heimdall..
They should have begged Kenneth Branagh or Alan Taylor to direct this one too.
Really if you like Power Rangers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this movie is for you. As for me I'll clear my head by watching Black Panther again."
20 October 2017,rizasoy,188,375,10,RagnaROCK!!!,"Let's get rid of this """"Aw,but the Ragnarok event in mythology has great battles, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters"""" nonsense.Cause these movies don't have to stick to the myth or comic books,100%.They should make changes for the sake of the movie.For instance,in NORSE MYTH,fenrir(the giant dog) is the son of Loki and hela is also the child of Loki. Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela and Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established and grounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writer could change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kids cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse Myth and in the comics.The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.This movie also showed us the real ""God of Thunder"".For the first time he was extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all over his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except for joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a boring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track record since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man."

Hela takes control of Asgard. On sakaar, the turnful events leads to great fight between Thor and Hulk. Thor along with Revengers tries to take back Asgard from Hela and her army, but he cant defeat her. So the final plan is executed of Surtur and Ragnarok.
Best of Thor movies in Infinity Saga. Fun, friends, love, intense, fights, amd visuals are too good. The Thanos ship (Sanctuary 2) at the end is the start of Infinity war.

In a departure from previous films in the series Hemsworth was required to reduce his stony-faced persona and stilted, prosaic delivery in favour of a more humanised, provincial persona. What worked well for the character as a marked contrast to the other heroes is now conspicuous for adding at the very least dimension. It reduced his power overall in a film about a lofty Norse deity but it is more fun for the masses who had seen the previous films if no one else. Hiddleston and Hemsworth have marvellously prickly exchanges throughout. More broadly, the film attempts the sort of ironic humour that worked well for the Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool films, but it doesn't succeed quite as well - except when Jeff Goldblum appears. There are improvements on Dark World in terms of the editing - we see much more of the splendour of the visual effects, especially the mystical planets. The film ramps up the talent stakes and theatrical absurdity with Cate Blanchett, but despite her best, melodramatic efforts we don't get the same kind of tension as we did of a banished heir to the throne returning home that we saw in the original Thor film. The director injects some New Zealand personality which characterises the film but the plot feels papered over with slogans and it feels like a silly pantomime in parts."

Ps- captain marvel will be a terrible flop."
3 November 2017,henriquevieiraprata,11,18,6,Forgettable,The start of the movie clearly was heavily gutted with scenes no longer that 30 seconds which felt really bad. Cheap and childish forced jokes that were not fun (excluding a few of them) and many scenes with clear bad acting. This movie feels like it was filmed in like a month and the editors worked with what they got. It's a movie that tried too hard to be guardians of the galaxy but became a parody of it. Its entertaining but nothing I got thrilled to watch. Something you watch when there is nothing special to watch anyway.

It's definitely more comedic than the previous films. However, most of the humor comes from characters acting differently than expected-to the point where they don't seem like the same superheroes we've gotten to know. It's not as solid as the original movie, but it's stronger than Thor 2 and, despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun."

All the characters are great and Cate Blanchett as the villain is epic. Hulk is the best Hulk yet, Loki is good, and Thor is the best Thor yet. There is plenty of laughs and the CGI is so good. A couple of cameos and just so many great subtleties. Go see it, and if Im right, which I am, come back and give it the review it deserves, because its at least an 8.5 out of 10 if you're conservative, but I gave it a 10."
22 October 2017,ozzyold,53,92,9,Intergalactic Blockbuster,"Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down. The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but also does its part for the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-like character we knew after spending some years on Earth. His new found humor fits well without throwing away the development that has occurs in previous appearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues to flourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise success. Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. No one will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash on a scale as large as this. Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of a lesser-known character that shall no longer be lesser-known. Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you on that character. Hela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist roles from past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to back her actions. Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX. Some overuse of comedy but it's what you come to expect from a blockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you from the threat at hand. A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel. 9/10."

I was surprised when he was tapped to direct Thor: Ragnarok and I was even more happily surprised that Taika Waititi kept his voice throughout the movie. The movie feels almost like a reboot that takes the Thor character in a new, less serious direction. The action remains but is surrounded by brighter colors and more campy characters (Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster is a hoot and the wonderful Rachael House brings a sly tongue-in-cheek shade to Topaz). It looks like it was fun to make and it was fun to watch and, as Taika Waititi also bring a sweet emotional edge that resonates by the end. If I have a question, it would have to be ""Where next?"" It seems that Thor is assembling his own team that includes The Hulk and Loki. Will they go off on their own adventures? Will The Revengers return? I hope so."

27 October 2017,yyuna7,40,73,8,A fun ride,"While I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok, it didn't really do anything new when you put it next to previous Marvel movies. It's a reproduction of the same thing over and over again, with maybe a little better jokes (it's really a matter of taste), which these movies are mostly depending on nowadays. It's sad how creators only think of how to bring masses to the theaters and thus the quality of the creation suffers. The main villain has no originality and all of her actions were predictable, which has happened to most of the superhero villains recently. They're brought in for the sake of only that one movie and get cast out before the end. Except for Loki. But in the end, nothing happens to him. (Tom Hiddleston looked so hot in that all-black suit, though.) The acting was really great on most parts, but Mark Ruffalo was so disappointing. Mostly it was bad script-writing for Bruce Banner, who was a joke in this movie, but he could've delivered his part so much better.I'm mostly bringing out the ""bad parts"", but I really did like the movie. It just wasn't what it could've been. I hope Marvel won't keep using the same pattern for all upcoming movies, soon it won't entertain even the masses they're aiming for."
30 October 2017,suhaibjoyia,67,121,10,Epic Space Adventure which propels Chris Hemsworth's Thor to A-List Status!!!,"I just came back from seeing it and this movie is awesome man.1) the action scenes were top notch in this movie. Thor has never been this epic in the MCU. He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie and he is definitely not under-powered anymore. Thor in unleashed in this, I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3) design-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effect in the movie. even the scene that changed from city to field looks better on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5) Hela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just the right amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of characters are so delightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment she enters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg is freaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the movie's got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some..but, when it's time to take things seriously, the movie does exactly that. specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is going down, the humor dials back a ton. It is only during the Sakaar portions of the movie where most of the humour is, not without several moments of sincere character interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the ""Ragnarok"" part was kind of genius. this may not be the Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it does make some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least, the Thor section of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasn't a single scene in which I felt bored.Overall this was one of Marvel's best films for me. It would definitely be in my top 5 marvel movies along with civil war, winter soldier, guardians of the galaxy and iron man 1. I'll probably rank it at 2nd or 3rd!!!"
20 December 2019,crowes-18865,6,12,1,The Only Thing Useful For The Devil's Would Be To Throw Every Copy Of This Movie Into It!,"A bigger fan of comic books, comic book movie adaptations and the subsequent merchandise than me you would be hard pressed to find but this movie is a juvenile and poorly written piece of trash the likes of which the actors and characters did not deserve to be associated with. From drunk Valkyries to naked Hulk this movie is filled with jokes a 10 year old boy would find funny. The director fancies himself a funny, funny man indeed. Well then perhaps his calling was to a career in stand up comedy where some of this low brow humor might land on willing ears. I'd rather be tied up and forced to watch the entire season of The Inhumans on infinite loop rather than be subjected to this film even one more time. Howard The Duck had better jokes than this and at least wasn't afraid to push the envelope into R rated territory but what we get with this allegedly family friendly romp through the halls of a junior high school hallway between bells is something which makes Tyler Perry filmmaking look like top tier cinematic entertainment. On the other hand it sure seems a fitting prequel to the forthcoming Love & Thunder which sounds as if it will only amp up the sophomoric gross out jokes from this abomination of a movie! And people hate on The Dark World, would take that any day of the week over this trash. I have spoken!"
30 January 2022,redmail-12802,12,20,2,A Thor Spoof,"I actually thought it was a Thor *Thor* movie. I started watching and it was a riff on Thor. A parody. A spoof.Featuring also a 'Hulk' this spoof is a 2017 reboot of the classic Laurel and Hardy series where the two goofballs bump into each other and things (like chairs), crack jokes and have people laugh at them (not with them).It is OK as a quick five-minute skit for your l'il nieces and nephews."
28 January 2018,ioshadha,4,6,6,Guardians of the Galaxy Attempt - Failed,"This is a Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy attempt that failed big time. If you are a Marvel fan and know the comics right this movie is an utter disgrace to the Thor character - I agree with every reviewer who stated that. I can't figure why Marvel drag this movie in the direction of a comedy - comedy carrier away big time.I'm also surprise by the IMDB 8+ rating on this... Perhaps its the same Guardians of the Galaxy audience that enjoy lite and fun movies who aren't necessarily Marvel fans either. So, you can easily see how people who voted this movie are in two opinions, either very low rating for this movie being an unbearable comedy or high rating for being nothing but a fun superhero movie. I had high expectations but walking away very disappointed. This movie had great potential for that budget and time spent...Marvel - Hoping your studios don't get carried away and side track from making good Marvel movies. There is no need of more comedy in any Marvel movies than what is there today. If not anything you need a little bit of more seriousness added to the movies.My Rating 6.5 at best."
31 March 2021,kaypalms,9,18,10,The Best of All The Marvel Movies,"This is what Marvel is to me. The unexpected humor. The exceptional action sequences. The twists, turns, but real true and genuine heart. It makes you feel good, scream, hold your breath, and cheer. Literally, Taika is a GENIUS and took Thor to the next level."
10 November 2021,masonsaul,7,19,10,Best Thor film yet,"Thor: Ragnarok is by far the best Thor film yet and easily one of the best films in the MCU in general. It's a really fun, insanely inventive and weird adventure with some mature themes that also manages to bring Thor's character arc to a very satisfying conclusion.Chris Hemsworth is reliably perfect as Thor and much funnier than in the previous ones. Tom Hiddleston is also reliably perfect as Loki once again. Tessa Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Karl Urban are all incredible and Cate Blanchett is definitely one of the better MCU villains. Jeff Goldblum is a hilarious scene stealer.Taika Waititi's direction is amazing, it's extremely well filmed, really stylish and refreshingly colourful. It's superbly paced and the CG is mostly impressive. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is amazing, it's completely different to what's come before but still pays respect to the original Thor score."
31 October 2017,pgs1968,38,70,10,Great entertaining family fun,"A well paced fun and action packed film. Its what films based on comics should be like. Whilst it moves all over the place (as far as one side of the Galaxy to the other) and flash backs in time could be confusing if not paying attention .. but to be honest I was glued to the screen and it all fitted in to the flow. One of , if not the best Marvel movie , certainly the best Thor by a long margin."
6 November 2017,BloodOfTheEnemy,8,14,8,"I'm not sure why, but I did enjoy it","As others have been saying, the movie has some significant flaws, and those need to be acknowledged first. The excess use of campy comedy is a big one, completely at odds in tone with the considerable slaughter that occurs throughout the movie with Hela's conquest of Aasgaard. That's not even to mention that it's supposed to be about Ragnarok, an apocalyptic event in Thor mythology. It's also a bit grating that Thor and Loki are buddies again. Apparently, even in spite of the destruction and death that Loki inflicted on New York in Avengers (2012), it's time to let bygones be bygones. Worst of all, I think, is that while Thor ought to be in Aasgaard dealing with, well, Ragnarok, he spends most of the time in captivity on another planet with the Hulk, all so that the writers can once again showcase superheros battling each other, as if we didn't get enough of that in Civil War, Avengers I and II, and Batman vs. Superman.Still, I did enjoy the movie. Much of the humor was really good, and the writers did manage to come up with a story in which Thor faced some serious challenges, ones that don't get solved with his trusty hammer. His adventures on Sakaar also reminded me nostalgically of Flash Gordon (1980), though I think that did belong in a different movie. All in all, I wish they would dial it back with campy humor already, but I did come out of the theater entertained, and I am certainly glad they didn't go super-dark, like Logan."

7 November 2017,thefilmnotebook,11,20,9,Waititi's definition of fun!,"We are all familiar with the superhero movie formulas by now – the invincible hero, the big bad villain, exuberant CGI action, and clichéd one liner jokes. Thor Ragnorak proves that this formula is not imperturbable, and the formula for superhero movies can evolve. Marvel Studios have on board this time, small feature filmmaker Taika Waititi (the wizard behind warm and hilarious films such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'. Waititi is very confident, and took isn't afraid to take risks, it seems here that he just wanted to bring his own interpretation of the superhero genre, and most importantly  to have some fun. It seems that everyone else wanted to have some fun too. Apart from the usual crew – Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum has also signed on to play villains Hela and the Grandmaster respectively. I think the sentiment was the same among them all – let's experiment and break some barriers, and cut some of that serious stuff. The story itself hasn't changed much from its usual form - we have a wicked and malicious villain Hela (Odin's first-born, thus Thor's sister), hell-bent on taking the throne of Asgard, and seeking supreme power through fear and destruction. It is therefore, up to our heroes, Thor, Loki (questionable), Heimdall (Idris Elba), the Hulk and newcomer Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) – a tough former Asgardian warrior girl, to stop her. Part of the story takes place on the planet of Sakaar, where we are introduced to some of our new characters – the eccentric and self-indulgent Grandmaster who rules the planet and hosts gladiator-like battles for entertainment, and Korg – an adorable, inadvertently funny creature (and gladiator) made from rocks. He befriends Thor, when he was trapped on the planet, and forced to compete against his 'friend' the Hulk. Korg is literally Waititi in rock form both physically and character wise) (he was played by Waititi through motion capture) – and I think many would agree that he was a highlight. All the characters, old and new, brought something refreshing to their identities – their own charisma and personalities. As a result, they are simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar. And that's where the fun is at. The film's temperament didn't feel like that of a typical serious end-of-the-world film, it felt more like a series of bloopers, where the camera catches all the behind-the-scenes banters and quibbles. The jokes and the humour is spontaneous, and the atmosphere is filled with good cheerfulness and bonhomie. If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean when I say the funniest bits are the Hulk 'jumping' out of the plane and Loki and Thor playing 'get help.' There's so much chemistry between Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Ruffalo, nothing feels forced. Another film comes to mind when I think of vibrant colours, a playful tone and upbeat music – that is, the 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This film is similar, but with its own wit and pleasant surprises. I think the humour is more effective and genuine here, it catches you off- guard because they happen at the most unexpected moments. It is truly hilariously entertaining. The 1980s music and score (by Mark Mothersbaugh), is fitting and extremely addictive, and extremely fun. You'll enjoy all the cameos too, I won't spoil them – but you'll definitely recognise them and smile. I didn't expect this film to be as fun as it was. It is a harmonious symphony of humour, action and storytelling. If examined closely, there are shortcomings and inconsistencies in the narrative, but for a fun superhero film, it is easily forgivable. Because it is distinctively Waititi, it is a bit of an outlier to the other Marvel films – but you'll laugh a lot and have loads of fun. I think I mentioned fun a hundred times in this review, but it seriously is."
5 November 2017,toybont,12,22,1,Good comedy but another forgettable Thor movie,OK let me start by saying that the comedy in the movie is good.funny movie overall. But like GoTg 2 the humour overshadows the serious moments. It's more of a teenager flick where no one cares about the consequences and repercussions the characters are just goofy and joke their way through all the destruction. Thor is supposed to be serious seeing ragnarok OK taking place but jokes after jokes makes the whole movie want to fall apart.
19 August 2021,raiyans-98227,10,21,8,"Fun , Thrilling , Comedy And Lots of action","This was such a fun, and thrilling movie. In this film, they finally make use of Chris Hemsworth's comedic skills, and played with the relationship that Thor and Loki have. The villain in this was so cool. 8/10 movie (personal rating)"
4 November 2017,roshan_simon,13,22,3,Bad!!,I don't know what all the hype is about. Humor was so third grade school. The humor worked in Guardians of the galaxy. But this it was terrible. I think I smiled just twice.Ending fight and the Hulk-Thor battle were good. That's about it. B- grade story line. They should have stuck with the storyline of Planet Hulk..
15 November 2017,atlasmb,5,13,10,Wowzapalooza,"Wow. Filled with inspired choices, ""Thor: Ragnorak"" is a real treat to watch. Credit director Taika Waititi with many of them. And hope he returns for the planned sequel. Following are some reasons why this film, which I did not watch in 3-D, is impressive and thrilling.The visuals. By now, one could be complacent about quality CGI, but for pure spectacle, T:R ranks among the best so far. The depiction of alien worlds, battle scenes, and many characters are among the wonderful special effects featured in this film.Casting. First there is the inspired casting of Cate Blanchett as Hela, the primary villain. She is determined to conquer Asgard. (But she might have to stand in line, considering the contingent of antagonists who wish to destroy Thor or his beloved home.) Tom Hiddleston is always perfect as Loki. Tessa Thompson is Valkyrie, a confident warrior with uncertain loyalties. Jeff Goldblum is a cocksure Grandmaster with a personality that totally fits the quirky comedic sensibility that director Waititi has given T:R. And there are plenty of other castings and cameos that are delightful.Humor. Already mentioned, the humor is a major component of the film (similar to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") and should not be taken for granted. There is a real risk in injecting silliness into a film of Gods and legendary warriors battling to the death.The story. T:R has a twisting storyline that feels really inspired. The non-linear narrative is filled with surprises and happy moments of discovery. And there is a precise balance between the light-hearted banter and whimsical sidetracks versus the serious conflicts between The God of Thunder and those who would destroy him, his people, and his world. As a final example of perfect choices made, a certain Led Zeppelin song feels like it was made for insertion into one of the final scenes, like there is a momentary pause while Odin, perhaps, cues up the tune."

Big action, big story, great cast (a superbly ripped Chris Hemsworth) good mix of heroes (I missed Lady Sif, though, but hopefully she escaped the slaughter and will show up in the next movie), convincing villain, twists and turns, stellar CG, entertaining, spot on humour. Even after a rewatch, I give this a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
27 October 2017,gmabber,36,63,9,Best MARVEL movie since Deadpool!,"This movie was so much fun! Seriously the third funniest MARVEL movie, right after Deadpool and GotG#1. The cast were top notch, lots of puns, lots of great moments. Hulk got more screen time, Loki got his satisfaction (no spoilers, but it was great!) and the music was very fitting. 9/10. Totally worth your time and money!"
6 November 2017,JasonR77,9,19,10,No hammer? No problem.,"Thor's reliance on mythological constructs is always a part of the draw for a fan of myth like myself, but also vexing because liberties are usually taken, and not always for the better. In this case, Hela(Hel in Norse mythology) has her background rewritten, but in this way it works, as it shows Odin's past, a past that is much more in line with his mythological self.That said, half the fun of Thor movies is Loki. I will never get tired of Tom Hiddleston in that role, and the rapport between he and Thor remains as great as it ever was. Thor also has a great few minutes with Dr. Strange, as teased at the end of that movie. It seems that each encounter with each different character brings a different level of snark from Thor that hasn't been as present in previous installments, and this makes him much more engaging and entertaining than he had been before. He trades jokes with fire demons, Hulk, Valkyrie, Loki, and anybody else he runs into.This movie is a lot of fun. For how serious the subject of Ragnarok is for Asgardians, they manage to have a good time with it. Cate Blanchett brings a great over the top touch to Hela, going so far as to give her a wit at times, and manages to separate her a bit from the rudimentary MCU villains.Marvel continues to make superhero films that are as fun as they are serious, and as such provides that truly engaging movie experience, reminding us that it's okay that The Grandmaster is a goofball, or that there's a guy made of rocks that's as soft spoken as they come. In the end, we get what we come for: The heroes do battle with a powerful villain throughout, summoning great courage and special effects to deliver a great time for all. And now, it's nearly time for the Infinity War. Stay tuned."
30 January 2018,claudio_carvalho,9,30,8,The Prophecy,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth) tries to stop the Ragnarok, an ancient prophecy about the destruction of Asgard. However he stumbles upon his evil older sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) that claims Odin´s throne in Asgard. They fight and Thor is defeated and captured by Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to fight his champion. Meanwhile Hela travels to Asgard to conquer the Asgadians and then the other realms.""Thor: Ragnarok"" is another great adventure of the Marvel´s characters. The screenplay is full of action and humor and the film is highly entertaining, a must-see for fans. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Thor: Ragnarok"""
9 November 2021,nlgthunder,7,16,9,Bizarre but wonderful,"This MCU instalment has its fair share of weird and whacky moments. But it is great fun, fast, fresh, and hilarious. It does a great job advancing Thor, Loki, and Asgard's storylines with a lot of colorful development. This film was as joyful to watch now as it was when it first came out. Aging very well!"
28 March 2021,repojack,8,20,10,The funnest Marvel movie of them all.,"MY GOD do I love this movie. After two middling Thor movies, Taika Waititi does James Gunn one better and makes Thor: Ragnorak the funniest and funnest MCU movie to-date.Chris Hemsworth seamlessly embodies Thor just as Robert Downey Jr. Is as irreplaceable as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Hemsworth is so comfortable in the role you can't imagine anyone else playing the character.And damn if Tessa Thompson isn't the most bad-ass (anti-)heroine of the MCU -- she's like the Han Solo for Marvel. She's just fantastic. If Natalie Portman doesn't bring her A-game to Love and Thunder, (which she didn't to the first two) I'd like to start a petition that Tessa Thompson takes her place (without the horrible Valkyrie outfit).Cate Blanchett rips it as Maleficent (er, I mean Hela). I love the way she just makes Karl Urban her boy-toy. Without her guidance would he really have manned up and jumped out of a space ship double wielding machine guns?!?!The majority of the action and dialogue scenes with Hulk proves the point that the Hulk is SO much better as a supporting character than.Lastly, is there a better song to go with an action sequence than Led Zeppelin's ""Immigration Song?"" If so, I can't think of one."
30 October 2017,bobbystarsmore,17,41,2,This was disappointing,"I don't know who wrote the script, who directed it and who produced it, but they should be fired. The Thor movies has always had a slightly darker tone and well written stories to help character development. This movie has none of that. Storytelling has been shoved to the side to make way for unnecessary comedy, reducing every character to the comic relief. Loki and Bruce Banner are two complex and sad characters who were only in the movie to satisfy fans and add more jokes.Had it not been for the brilliant acting of Tom Hiddleston and Cate Blanchet, I probably wouldn't have seen the entire movie. This is not a superhero movie, this is a badly made action comedy. And as a long time Thor comic fan, this hurts my heart to write."
20 April 2019,kaseyossef,23,47,1,Did you think Disney despises Star Wars????,"Watch this! Disney despises Thor even more!! They killed him and buried him and replaced him with a jokester ersatz fool to dole out silliness.

In this film Thor literally cannot recall the god of what he is!!!"
10 February 2021,ellagilbert-23101,7,15,8,taika waititi doing charity work,This movie shouldnt have been as good as it was. extremely entertaining
19 February 2018,snakeye808,6,9,8,"Come for the Action, Stay for the Comedy","If there's one area where superhero movies generally fall short, it's in the storyline and dialogue, while the fight scenes and special effects never disappoint. Ragnarok is the exception as they have finally put together a story that remains gripping throughout the film, largely due to all the laughs the movie provides. I thought it was peculiar whe I heard the new Thor movie was being directed by Taika Waititi, who is known for comedies including the amusing well-known film, ""What We Do In The Shadows"". I have to give credit to him for showing his unknown talent in making terrific action scenes, but for also bringing a better comedic touch to the Marvel universe. I noticed IMDB Trivia points out how Waititi says probably 80 percent of the film was improvised or ad-libbed, so I reckon he deserves credit for adding funny lines and letting the actors have fun making the film. Waititi doesn't only deliver in terms of comedy though, he also creates some of the neatest fight scenes I've seen from a Marvel movie. In particular, the fight between Thor and a fellow Avenger was very well done and a pleasant surprise to me when they encountered one another.In the end, it's the most enjoyable superhero movie I have seen (and I've seen them all), because unlike the others that have cheesy, dull dialogue separating the stunning action sequences, Ragnarok is never boring between the action scenes. In fact, it's practically a comedy that is enhanced and made better by the action when it comes along. In other words, you're not just sitting and waiting for the next duel to come along, but you're excited when it arrives. Some of the other superhero films, on the other hand, have been obviously hastily written, as if they came up with a few cool fights and then quickly wrote up a weak storyline with shody banter between characters to connect the fight scenes. With Ragnarok, I was never bored for a second and (shockingly) never had to roll my eyes even once due to the usual sappy, overly sentimental segment that is meant to touch our hearts, which had become fundamental to these superhero films. Ultimately, Ragnarok brings the action as expected, but it also brings the comedy, and does so in a perfect balance, to create the best overall superhero movie to date."

9 November 2017,yoyopa,8,18,9,The hype is real!!,"You know...The last time I saw a movie because of it's hype was Wonder Woman. Which was unbelievably god awful. After that monstrosity i swore I'd never see another movie based on good or ""sponsored"" reviews ever again! I saw a trailer or two for Thor Ragnarok and thought..looks cool..looks pretty funny actually...But nah, I'll wait till I can stream it on some website for free. Hey I live in LA..going to a movie costs more than my wifi bill. Then I looked at the cast--Chris Hemsworth..a pretty boy who can actually act. Okay. Tom Hiddleston..I like the guy..and he plays Loki to absolute perfection. Okay. Idris Elba..my dude! always gotta support that guy..and looks like they actually gave him something to do..instead of relegating one of the most talented actors working right now to a featured extra role. Okay again. Cate Blanchett , while I respect her talent, has always been a bit POSH for my tastes. Not the most accessible actress I've ever seen. I always thought she would think herself above this sort of movie. However, she was great and seemed to really enjoy the role.Then they threw in my baby Tessa Thompson. OKAY. Jeff Goldblum..playing JEFF GOLDBLUM. I was laughing the second he showed up in the trailer. And Anthony Hopkins..legend of legends. He truly is the heart of this franchise and thats made really clear in this film.Guys..it was great. When I say it was hilarious..It was truly funny..but not in a stupid, completely misplaced way like Age of Ultron..or ANY of the other marvel movies. This director captured exactly how we communicate with our friends, family and significant others. Taika captured US! People. The Audience. He made his characters in our image..and it was amazing. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. Thor Ragnarok is exactly was this genre is supposed to be."
21 November 2017,areadydefense,7,11,5,Trainwreck,I was thoroughly disappointed in this film. I grew up reading Thor and loved the first two movies. This was a disaster from beginning to end. The director tried to make it into a comedy and failed miserably. The funny lines weren't funny or memorable and it took away from the action. I will watch for other movies this director works on and avoid them.
7 July 2018,PeachesIR,3,5,5,Plenty of action but perhaps too goofy,"I enjoyed both ""Thor"" and ""Thor: The Dark World,"" so I was looking forward to ""Thor: Ragnarok."" I thought this third installment had way too many silly, goofy, corny jokes, and tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink cameos. However, Cate Blanchett makes a very stylish villain as Hela (and looks spectacular in her costume), and the clashes between Thor, Loki, Heimdall, etc. and the baddies are well done -- lots of action, music (Led Zeppelin for the moms and dads in the audience!), explosions, CGI, etc. This movie would have been much better with 30% fewer wisecracks and winks to the fourth wall, however. I had the feeling that the screenplay was written by someone who had dropped acid."
14 December 2017,farismatthew-53074,3,4,2,Another Monstrosity,"I went to see this movie with friends but as soon as it started I knew it was going to be bad. I have not watched any of the other Thor movies because Thor is the worst super hero, I mean there are so many better heroes based around lightning, like the flash. But since my friends decided to see this I was forced to go. They has so much potential with the other characters but instead the stick with the worst one, Thor. I guess there was some OK action but when it comes down to like always DC beats them in that department. Honestly if you walk into a movie theater and are forced to choose between this or any other current movie, just watch justice league and see how the professionals do it."

5 November 2017,MeowMeow1962,15,23,8,Not The Best Thor Movie,"I have to be honest, I have loved most of the Marvel movies but this one is the exception. I found this movie horrible when compared to others. The cameos were sad and unnecessary, Jeff Goldblum's character was just pathetic, and the comedy was juvenile, at best. No spoiler alert needed as it wasn't good enough to spoil."
13 March 2020,glide7,4,6,8,Hilarious!,"I didn't want to see this movie at first since I thought the first one was meh and the second one was dull as dishwater but I think this one is by far the best of the three. There's a big change in tone in this one as it's more of a comedy and the characters don't take themselves seriously but the jokes worked for me big time. You could say it's a parody of the first two and as such it doesn't feel like the ""real"" Thor, but somehow they absolutely nailed it."
30 November 2017,Spiritvs,21,35,1,Weakest MCU Movie so far.,"A little goofiness is OK. But Thor has too much of it. Was expecting an Epic, Action filled, dramatic Thor film, not a silly space comedy. And it ain't that funny also. Not like Guardians or even Ant Man. Those are funny and well made. This one is a train wreck. The weakest movie of the MCU so far. It's a bad joke. The characters had so much potential, but everything was wrong. Bad acting, Bad jokes, Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum being certainly the worst. Odin's scenes were horrendous. What a mess. No emotions, no story background. Feels like a rushed product, made by a cinema first year student. The previous Thor movies were so majestic and dramatic. This one looks like a bad B movie with great CGI. No serious Thor or Marvel fan will think this movie is good or fun. So Disappointed. Waste of money. Awful."
24 October 2017,cateravenq,72,133,9,Arguably the best in MCU!,"This movie shows something I've never seen in MCU. It's amazing for its plot setting, pace, visual effect, music etc. They are telling the story right, and making it hilarious and exhilarating. Every role is developed and paid adequate amount of attention. So glad to see that Hulk was finally given more personality. I also liked the female characters in this one, both very bad ass fighters, no unnecessary romantic entanglement as the previous works. (I mean, it's not about Jane herself, she's fine, but was written in a way that doesn't really fit in or helpful to the plot.)btw I watched it in BFI IMAX. It was such an experience! Would highly recommend 3D or IMAX for it's visual effects."

One major achievement of this movie is that it has great comedy(Thor-Loki-Hulk are a great combo for that), it has some dramatic moments and awesome action sequences. Fight scenes are intense and they give each character the time to shine. Including secondary characters as well. It's also interesting that you get to see another version of each character especially with Thor and Hulk. Loki is... well Loki as always in his exceptional way.And you got your weird eccentric Villain in a nice fit for Goldblum and a powerful female villain in Hela.It features nice cameos and in general the movie feels important with an ""Avengers"" magnitude but with less than half the roster.Nicely done... Revengers!"
23 December 2020,richardredner,8,14,10,Ragnarocked Balls!,This edition to the saga was one of pure adventure and excitement. I absolutely loved it for everything it represents.
22 November 2017,FelipeCarrillo,2,3,8,"Eureka!, a shrewd filmmaker gives Thor what he deserves","""Thor: Ragnarok,"" the latest entry in Marvel universe directed by Taika Waititi, that acts as an official introduction to the mega- production awaiting for us next year after Ryan Coogler's upcoming ""Black Panther"" (2018); in the same way, the studio reasonably experience the sweet smell of film success thanks to a sidesplitting flick that has a more grandiose wrapper than its content.Just like Luke Skywalker, Odin is still off the Asgardian radar. While Thor and his fallacious stepbrother Loki move to Earth to discover the whereabouts of their father — with a helping hand included —, Hela, their cruel (step)sister, a powerful goddess, rises up from the ashes of the past to send, by force, the pair of brothers to Sakaar, a planet ruled under the jolly way of acting of the Grandmaster, in order to get the throne of his former nation, Ragnarok. To address this, Hemsworth will face a staggered succession of mishap without his legendary hammer, making use exclusively of his worldly abilities and picking up on the way an irreverent and irregular group of allies who crave, from the deepest part of their hearts, to eliminate vile Goddess of Death before it is too late. Narratively, ""Ragnarok"" possesses heroic avant-garde conjunctures, such as introducing— although under a circumspect filter — the very first bisexual character within this mega-franchise, fencing two characters (on the same side) in the same Roman war area, playing with more than one antagonist in the same plot, going for broke to cut main hero's powerful blonde long hair, changing abruptly settings by amusingly ordinary circumstances that are poured into utopian and fantastic molds as the coexistence of our stouthearted superhero with a sour-faced roomie into a galactic apartment for a few days, holding dear really the possibilities that comic books have and hundreds more that enable the feature film to differentiate itself radially from the multitude of film genres Marvel Studios has managed to run: whether comedies (""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Deadpool"", ""SpiderMan: Homecoming"" and ""Iron Man""); action thrillers (""Civil War"", ""Logan"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier""), fantasy ones (""Thor"", ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Doctor Strange"") or light flicks (""Hulk"" and ""Ant-Man""); Taika Cohen's celluloid fits in each of these genres with results as irregular as unbelievable. Perhaps most of the spectators don't agree with my perception, but, in personal terms, visual imagery and artistic work exhibited in the film did not impress me as I expected.Marvel has assumed the hard task of distinguishing, thoroughly, every of its film ideas in any of the work fields, either frictions lying in the lexicon of characters, the distinctive nature of them, the film genre or the artistic scenarios that serve as a home for the stories. ""Ragnarok"" was advertised as a deluge of colors and hilarious events — both in its narrative strangeness and its splendor in film execution — never seen before; the posters have been one of the best among the competition and the trailers had a high expectation, in fact, this was fulfilled, however, it worked as a desired allergen for me. In short: ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is like eating up your favorite candies without any limit, after an hour, you're terribly cloyed. Color saturation, paraphernalia and spectacularity attempt to fill a lack of real new landscapes, imaginations that are absent, bombarding with color and artistic eccentricities to excess. It does not necessarily mean a patent defect, however, perhaps it can be translated into a double-edged weapon.Analyzing the sound condition, the feature film seems to have been produced by a mix of talents between Edgar Wright, James Gunn, and Mark Mothersbaugh. Under a prominent influence of classic hits of yesteryear, Waititi's movie promised great things in regard to the original motion picture soundtrack, including, as a starter, no more no less, that Led Zeppelin's revolutionary ""Immigrant Song"" as a fundamental music accompaniment at the first official trailer, a song that also mean a key point in the closing colossal bout. Garnished by compositions created explicitly for the film, the flick switch between classics and proper musical creations at a good pace, it ranks third in the top list of the best scores in the MCU, a merit achieved even though when they aren't entirely original sounds.From the same mind behind ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" and ""What We Do in the Shadows"", comes ""Thor: Ragnarok""; no doubt, the main cause of the triumphant revival of Thor is thanks to this funny filmmaker— an adjective justly gained. Sinewy God of Thunder has passed through the hands of Kenneth Branagh (""Murder on the Orient Express"") and Alan Taylor (""Terminator Genesys""), however, neither of the two didn't get the opportunity to draw forth his potential in all its splendor, a flaw faded only until the nifty and creative vis comica of the New Zealander emerged as a genuine elixir of life to the character. Without fear of being mistaken, in the marrow of every fascinating feature is this proficient director, his diversity of ideas is absolutely comedic and his film determinations fit in the profile he desires for his projects with great diligence. By dint of a sharp, irreverent and daring perspective, this man has raised a pic of interesting properties, with a heart and a dramatic weight that exceeds in size and visual quality the creative display.In sum, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" can be synthesized adequately in a brief and exciting name: Taika Waititi— of course, not downplaying the fabulous work done by the different areas of the film. Hilarious, visually oppressive and entertaining, Marvel Studios remains high on its prestige as it prepares for a wave of spasmodic and challenging releases, Among which stand out its very first motion picture starring an entirely black cast (""Black Panther""), its film with a female in the stellar role (""Captain Marvel"") and the mega-event that will mean ""Infinity War"" when arrives our hearts in May 2018."
27 April 2022,Raja77,2,3,10,What A Fun Movie!,"This movie is just so fun and entertaining to watch, and I love how it incorporates the Pagan Stories into the plot far better than the previous Thor Movies did.The best Thor Movie out of the entire trilogy!"
30 December 2017,ripper_spyky,4,6,3,I'm getting to old for this shi...,"The first Marvel movie i actually hated.
Scourge is underused a bad joke if you will.
The plot is moronic.
Desperate attempt to introduce humor where is not needed. 
Thor is nothing like the other films like, the carter acts totally different.
No need or logic for why Odin is dead.
Hope they end this MCU soon ."
25 May 2019,nairtejas,4,10,5,One-Line Review: Thor: Ragnarok (5 Stars),"Taika Waititi's indie style is all over the place in Marvel's Thor: Ragnarok but I still cannot fathom the point of forced, untimely humor that all these MCU films are feeding their scripts with and then boasting about it even as the whole story takes on a little sensible turn after a dozen or so textbook plotlines. TN."
26 August 2019,treycekensei,15,29,1,What a joke,"It was a joke and the joke was lame.In its Quarterly accounting department meeting where all projects are assigned and revenue projections are made the treasury department decided this Thor is not going to be a Thor at all.
He is a moron who even forgets which god he is. He doesn't even know that he is the god of thunder. Seriously!
Then he cracks some jokes and does a stand-up routine and so the pre-teen crew is satisfied with the movie mommy and daddy took them to see.
That is all."
9 November 2017,javi-y-se-acabo,5,10,5,Entertaining At Times But Excessively Comical,"Marvel discovered a formula for their films that worked well. And now they are starts to copy all of their movies, so they look all like the same one.The story is about Hella, the sister of Thor, being released after being captive for a long time, so she decides to invade and destroy Asgard. Thor is trying to stop the Ragnarok, a massive power that could destruct an entire planet. This is basically the story, and while it's great, I just couldn't help but feel like it was a joke. It's the end of the world but let's just make jokes about everything and make this movie full with little jokes from the very first minute to the very end of the credits.If all the jokes were funny, this would have been a really great comedy about Thor, but the problem is that for me, most of them were just not funny and unnecessary.The cast was okay. Chris Hemsworth fits really well in this character and he provided the needed performance, as well as Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. Tessa Thompson was also okay and had some bad ass moments but she didn't get to do that much at any moment. My main problem is with Tom Hiddleston and Cate Blanchett. They look like they needed more screen time and less jokes to make their characters really shine, but they were just secondary (and I would say that even background) characters.Not everything is complain. I mean, this movie really entertains you at many moments and some action sequences at Planet Sakaar were really awesome. This are the parts I wish were longer. Where they have just superheroes in action, pure fun and entertainment. The visuals were impressive at some moments, even if at times felt a little too much of CGI. Also, the score is great, mixing orchestral music with the fantastic synthesizers of the 80's, but the bad thing is that at most parts this score is just covered by a lot of background noises that don't let the score shine properly at some parts where it should have.Overall, this is an entertaining movie, but for watching it once, because in the following viewings I think this will end up being just repetitive.I would recommend you this if you're a die hard Marvel fan, because you will get what you're looking for."
19 October 2017,yoncakizil,278,564,10,Exceeded my expectations,"This movie really exceeded my expectation.For me it is already the second best comic book movie,right after Logan.When I ve watched the both of the trailers,I ve thought Thor 3 has the best trailer in this genre so far.Trailers really met with my expectations.You are gonna see epic showdowns just like the way you imagined.Glad they didn't go on serious,boring mode like they did in Thor 2.Cause that movie bored me to death just like man of steel did.Lastly,I just wanna say that Taika Watiti is pretty damn good director who can make both good stories/plots and brilliant jokes/references(just like deadpool's humor).Thanks again for all the joy you gave me Marvel."
29 October 2017,stuartwhyte-26515,46,82,10,Wow what a Movie,This is a fantastic look back to how movies used to be made. Without the three hour snore fest and when Cinema was at its peak. Its funny and smart with comedy that is not in your face so much as all around it. It really is a brilliant debut in the big time by this kiwi director. It is up there with logan for my all time favourite move. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy.
27 May 2018,CadBane73,3,4,4,Thor will return in Avengers: Infinity War,"A 2-hourish long, slow-paced, not enough action-packed prologue to Avengers: Infinity War. Mildly interesting..."
28 March 2020,kirasnick,3,3,10,I actually had fun at a Marvel movie,"It wasn't like the other Thor movies, or even the other Marvel movies. Which, frankly, was an absolute relief. It was nice to go to a Marvel movie and enjoy myself. The studio learned from Guardians of the Galaxy that humor and a novel, cohesive aesthetic makes for a movie you want to see rather than a movie you feel like you /have/ to see in order to understand the rest of the MCU movies."
20 October 2017,kutluyal,237,480,10,great experience,"""Fun"" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means ""not art"" or ""lacking drama."" And the word ""funny"" likewise doesn't negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or ""true art"" simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into ""us versus them,"" but the extent to which it's devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isn't ""art,"" is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up"
2 March 2019,NarniaIsAwesome,8,18,1,Thor: Ragnarok is... Loathsome and Revolting!,"Let me just get right to it: It sucks! It stinks! It's a rotting pile of old brussel sprouts (my apologies if you like brussels) mixed with wet dog fur and topped with old braunschweiger for good measure. Okay, now that I've summed it up, let's get to the meat of it.For starters, it's a Marvel movie, and a Thor movie, of which I am not a fan. But that aside, I tried it anyway. *sigh*The characters are simply deplorable. It seems that each and every one of them is raunchy, over the top, and just plain unlikable. The worst of the lot is Vallkyrie (Tessa Thompson), whose name doesn't even make sense because it refers to her occupation. She is rude, drunk, and violent. Thor is, as always, completely annoying. His constant cheeky remarks quickly get tiresome. Hela (Cate Blanchett) is a typical villain, with no color or originality about her (well, she has antlers, but still). Loki (Tom Hiddleston) requires no complaint, but also evokes no praise either. Then we come to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who literally owns a space junkyard. My critique of him alone, should I write it, would be several pages.The plot is awful; you care nothing for what's going on. The action is too busy to even look at. I usually go on a bit more, but all I can say is 'Thor: Ragnarok' is ""Yuck!!!"""
10 December 2019,SamuelSanchez11,7,12,5,Too much funny stuff,I hate how they had to make everything seem funny. Thor is a funny guy but that doesn't mean his film has to be made entirely into a comedy.
6 July 2022,thorlawrance,2,2,10,My Most Watched MCU Movie Ever!,"I've probably watched Ragnarok for over 20 times. It makes lot of sense each time I watching it. Taika took Thor to an all new direction by his fantastic talent. Previous Thor movies were awesome but unlike them this movie has a better storyline, character growths and CGI.I love how it started with a scene of Thor and sturtur. They had a funny chat by the way:) after that one of the most iconic fight scene of Thor. Also I love how the logo of Ragnarok appeared with metal music it was fantastic!If you are huge fan of Thor you should watch this at least five times because it's totally a masterpiece and probably the best Thor movie out of three!"
18 April 2019,himluyuyde,10,17,2,Not As Good Colbert,But Better Than Howard SternDo people really enjoy this comedy? So twisted. No one film caused the murder of a character so much in this universe of endless stupid sequels. When will there be an actual serious super hero film that is as good as the comics? This is too bad.
13 April 2018,LiveLoveLead,2,3,4,Confusing...,"It's not that the film was terrible, it just wasn't your typical Thor/Marvel film so you go into it expecting one thing and getting another. This Thor is more comical and cheesy. It's not a superhero, action-adventure flick with comedy, but a comedy with some action. Almost like a spoof. The jokes were non-stop and corny. The acting was mediocre and the story line was average. We still watched the whole movie but didn't feel it was up to par with the other superhero movies. Maybe if you go into it knowing what to expect you would enjoy it more, instead of feeling like you were taking a sip of soda only to find out its milk...In My Humble Opinion!"
6 May 2018,vmalast,4,8,1,Ugh!,"They just should toned down a few things to give this a G rating because, this was the age level the humor was geared for. As a previous reviewer stated, it's the end of the world and the humor was that of slipping on a banana peel. The Guardians of the Galaxy series did it so much better."

6 November 2017,b-70270,15,25,10,Im gonna see this film in theater again and again!!,"I think marvel finally figured out the characters of Thor and Loki, especially Thor's. In the first two movies in the franchise, and in Avengers12, the only thing I remembered about him is "" A strong but a little dumb hero with a hammer, long blonde hair and brother issues "". That's all, far away from my best hero list. But now, after thor3, dudes he is on the list!!! I even want to buy a hammer-shaped cup on my desk. He is smart, humor, protective and he knows how to deal with his relationship with Loki, breaking the thin images in the previous movies. That's exactly how the Thor Series should have been made! Taika Waititi WHERE WERE YOU.Thor 3 is amazing. I REALLY didn't expect this one will be that good. Actually, I was not sure if I should go to the cinema to see this movie until the trailer with ""immigrant song"" came out. (I am a Marvel fan but it took me 3 times to finish watching thor1, well I mean Thor 1 is not that bad... it's just a kind of boring and tooo old-fashioned that nothing surprised me at all. ) I saw thor3 in IMAX and I knew got that ticket is the right choice less than 5 minutes after the movie started. IT IS AWESOME AND EPIC. The action scenes and soundtrack are perfectly matched. The story line is great. And I must say Thor 3 has the BEST JOKES in Marvel universe! Better than the guardians of the galaxy!Have seen this in IMAX for 2 times, will see it in Dolby soon."
22 January 2021,r96sk,6,18,9,I had a blast with this,"'Thor: Ragnarok' continues the upward direction of the 'Thor' films.I had a blast with this. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story unfold, the score is terrific, the new and old cast members are great and there's a lot of amusement in there too. It's superb, it's my third favourite MCU film at this stage.Don't get me wrong, I like the 2011 original but that's turned out to be the weakest of the three. I found 'Thor: The Dark World' to be a fairly major improvement on that, this 2017 is narrowly better than that aforementioned 2013 release. Bring on 'Thor: Love and Thunder'!Chris Hemsworth is quality in the lead role, I found him super enjoyable in this second sequel. Big fan of his new hairstyle, by the way. This is also the most I liked Tom Hiddleston in an MCU film. Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and, particularly, Tessa Thompson are fab additions. Shoutout to (director, as well!) Taika Waititi also, he made me laugh a fair few times as Korg.Great film, oh and I love the nod to a certain 1971 Quaker Oats Company-induced film... nicely done."

I swear why don't Marvel just make up new names for the characters if there just gonna completely change the history.Still the only way to truly show a comic book movies is ANIMATE it.

18 January 2021,questl-18592,6,18,8,Thor 3,"Quite possibly the most raw fun to be had at an MCU movie. Thor: Ragnarok is a technicolor acid trip of nonstop laughs and amusement that doesn't let up. It may not fit perfectly within the rest of the MCU and may make some changes by playing fast and loose with the rest of the MCU but it absolutely works to create something that's just pure fun from start to finish and it gets massive points for that.At this point, you're either in or out on the MCU so I can't say this is gonna change anyone's mind on the whole universe but if this was somehow missed it should be rectified immediately. However, if you've been living under a rock somewhere and haven't kept up with the MCU at all, this isn't one I'd suggest to start with."

It never flags for a second - steamrollering through one episode to the next without allowing the audience to catch its breath. Everyone over-acts like it's a competition and the effect is an epic and inevitable cult classic. Nuff said !

3 November 2017,stringkate,15,24,5,Disappointingly juvenile and unintelligent,"As a fan of the previous Thor movies and MCU movies in general, I feel this was the worst Marvel movie so far. I had such high hopes for it, but the genre change to slapstick comedy alienates former fans in favor of bringing in new fans. The only truly funny parts were the ones that weren't trying. Many of the jokes were either crude or aimed at an immature audience, causing them to fall flat (if you have to resort to anatomical jokes, you aren't funny). Hulk was horribly annoying, and many of the characters came off as undignified and wimpy (such as having responses that aren't proportionate to the situation). I felt that the characters that I used to love are suddenly unlikable, and frankly I lost respect for them. I admit that I require my comedy to be intelligent, and this was anything but. I love Cate Blanchett, and her performance was great. In fact, she gave such potential for a cool villain, but Hela wasn't developed enough as a threat, and with the constant bombardment of bad jokes, you don't get a chance to appreciate the situation that she places the heroes in. For a dark situation based loosely on a dark comic and a dark mythology, the serious ""relief"" moments felt out of place. The character arks were obvious, and the solution at the end was dissatisfying and simple. I'm left with the sense that I would give anything for a redo. I'm longing for a third chapter that I can fall in love with. I want to pretend that this movie didn't exist. Bonus stars for good effects."
18 May 2021,RobAKehoe,8,16,8,Thor The Third!,A great third film for Thor and coming after the second dismal Thor film this one stands out as even better than the first.

25 January 2018,rdoliva,9,16,1,Nonsensical driveling story. Avoid it and save yourself the aggravation,"What a letdown! After the success of the great Captain America movies and most of the Avengers ones i confess myself disillusioned and perplexed by this new installment.Most of the movie feels like an extended version of the pod-racing scene on Star Wars Episode I with an ever-present Jar Jar Binks: absurd and irrelevant, forcing a quick and mediocre finale. Thor, the god of thunder, is reduced to a babbling moron who needs to be reminded that he is indeed a god and as such has powers. The story, if i can call it that, will probably remind you of the redneck avengers parody on youtube, but even that short script is far better. Whoever wrote this script seems to have been hellbent on wiping his butt on the Marvel characters and Universe by producing the most fetid turd of a movie he could think of with the complicity of the director.I cannot understand how so many famous actors and actresses accepted a role in this film catastrophe. I thought they read scripts before accepting a role, but i guess not. Perhaps the only two actors not portrayed as morons were Benedict Cumberbatch and Cate Blanchett. Even a talented actor like Tom Hiddleston comes out with a tarnished reputation, and don't get me started on Sir Anthony Hopkins. I feel sorry for both.On top of all that, there was far too much mediocre special effects."
9 February 2021,spinoff75,5,11,6,Don't be generous with the ratings.,"The screenplay overuses humor, it's joke after joke like if the movie was a comedy. Taika Waititi again messed up here, come on let be honest: he's an overrated director and that stupid Korg character (voice impersonated by him) is the Jar Jar Binks of Marvel. The Hulk's CGI and personality also are way different of previous movies so there's no continuity. Talking about that, A LOT of errors of continuity between shots. That's directing and editing mistake!"
29 October 2017,pegadodacruz,14,35,7,Another Experience where technology ruins it!,"It's sad that such a good movie gets ruined by the hype of 3D. This one on my opinion didn't work with 3D, and that is the fundamental flaw in regard to this movie. I just cant pass the fact that images seems to small, spacecraft that looks like flies, people that looks like dummies for being so small on screen and jump straight to looking normal size...anyway those are technicalities.Now to the movie - Am I wrong or is this using the same soundtrack as DC's League? Works! Great sound editing great soundtrack that fits the mightiness of Thor. As always not a lot of swirl around the story line, that continues to be for me one key ingredient for the success Marvel Studies have been gaining with its movies when comparing to the DC Universe. Simple, straight to the point and straight to the action (after all I don't believe people going to watch super-heroes movies are expecting reality) - so the key is then entertainment. And Marvel does this well. It treats super heroes movies like comic books with motion. That's it.The action is good - (again 3D damages some of it) - The Lord of thunder is awesome the special effects plus the sound mix - makes it really entertaining. Kate Blanchet - how do they do it? If being a goddess of death is this hot...nice refreshing act from her... on less common note that the one she's known mostly for...A Hulk that have conversations? straight funny. Valkyrie, nicely played, Loki always entertaining and one Idris Elba that is simply convincing as the one that sees it all...Apart of the 3D, if one thing I would like more - Hulk and Thor fight.It feels this is not the last stance - so looking forward for the next one... if possible 3dless."

10 June 2021,mcbrion,8,19,3,"Puerile, but has its moments...","I immediately looked at all the worst reviews (the 1 and 2 ratings) and I couldn't disagree with anything they said. This is Thor as ""Frat Boy"" with poor jokes. He was considerably more ""Thor"" in the first movie, with the nobility that is part of Thor's character. I knew as soon as I heard Led Zepplin in the first 10 minutes when Thor is fighting Surtur that this was going to be one of Marvel's more juvenile movies. I was not disappointed in my observations.No point in mindlessly bashing it, but accurately describing it? That I can do.1) Hela is not Odin's daughter. 2) Nobody can actually destroy Mjolnir: this was done strictly for the 15-year olds, who like to see punches, big arena fight scenes and endless ray guns shooting everywhere, and, 3) this just isn't Ragnarok in any serious sense. So, this is a teen comedy!Which explains Skurge, the Executioner. In the movie, he behaves like a 14 year old, complete with toys, trying to impress the ""babes.""
Everyone talks like they're on 20th century Earth. Is this so the viewing audience doesn't have to think at all? I guess it is. It reminded me of one of the 'Charlies Angels' movies, only with guys.That said, no review that's not ""RAH RAH"" good will influence anyone who uses the word ""awesome"" at least 5 times a day. It IS entertainment, but entertainment that I can press ""pause,"" make a phone call or three, or do a 10 minute meditation, read the New York Times, come back to this, and hit ""play"" again without ever feeling like I lost anything. There's no tension (as was pointed out in the 1s and 2s reviews), no character development (there's that ""FratBoy Thor"" again), and Cate Blanchett, for the one and only time, was an extremely banal Hela, whose hairstyle must have been done by the late Vidal Sassoon (but then, you'd had to have actually read Thor comic books to care about that, ) and that's why the poor reviews are (justifiably) poor.As the late, great famous wit, Dorothy Parker once said of a play, ""It ran the entire gamut of emotions from A to B."" If you understand that, good. If you don't, then Thor is going to be okay for you, and there's nothing wrong with that! 87% of the audience on Rotten Tomatoes liked it.Me? I'll take The Black Panther movie over anything else Marvel has put out, although the FIRST Avengers movie was quite well done (and completely unlike this)."

5 November 2017,arungeorge13,3,7,7,Count on the MCU to keep its fans happy all year round! [+74%],"It's the third Marvel movie of the year 2017 and the third entry in the 'Thor' series. With New Zealand director Taika Waititi at the helm, we hoped to see a further lightening of tone as opposed to the first two installments as well as treading fresh ground in terms of narrative structure. Thankfully, Thor: Ragnarok delivers on both counts.The screenplay by Eric Pearson (who wrote for the Marvel 'One-shot' vignettes), Craig Kyle (the writer/co- producer for an array of animated Marvel DTV & television entries) and Christopher Yost is one of the smoothest to come out of the MCU - the segments are connected well, supplemented by an easy- to- comprehend central plot and packed with sufficient elan. Much of the dialogue seems to have to been improvised on set as the chemistry between the ensemble shows - a witty jab here, a neat pun there and a sweet slur too, somewhere in between. The cameos and Easter eggs in fact, warrant reviews of their own. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) shows up quite early on in a scene that ties his character in close proximity with the Avengers; The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is present in almost two-thirds of the flick and this time around, he speaks (not just when he's Bruce Banner, although the Banner bits are 'vintage-Ruffalo'). The 'Tony Stark' references ('Point Break' was hilarious!) are sprucely inculcated. Unseen MCU characters such as Ares, Man-Thing, and Beta- Ray are also nimbly referenced (in the form of stone-busts). If you've got a good eye (for Hollywood), you could observe Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth in minuscule roles as well (wink). Oh, and not to forget, Stan Lee's cameo as the 'barber'.The chief villain(ess) in the movie is Hela, the God of Death and Thor's sister, played by Cate Blanchett, who manages to 'steal the thunder' from both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) whenever she's on screen. While it is appreciable to see a female main-antagonist for the first time in the MCU, there is very little fleshing-out done for her character (which hopefully, will be rectified in later entries). What's great about 'Thor: Ragnarok' is how the film all of a sudden deviates from the core, about 30 minutes in, and yet manages to keep its viewers thoroughly entertained. Hiddleston and Hemsworth (with great comic timings themselves) are aided by Jeff Goldblum who plays a completely madcap Grandmaster and the host of the 'Contest of Champions', Tessa Thompson donning the role of a bad-ass 'Valkyrie' who relishes her alcohol intake (and comes across mildly as a Norse version of 'Sarah Connor') and a CGI-'Korg' (voiced by Waititi - he reserves some of the best lines in the movie for himself, and makes sly references to his earlier ventures). The set-pieces themselves are a treat for the eyes, hallmarked by Led Zeppellin's 'Immigrant Song' (the original version and not a cover) that has its roots firmly planted in Norse mythology. The absence of Jane Foster & Co. was hardly felt.Waititi's attempt falls more in line with James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films than the previous two 'Thor' entries. Even when comedic efforts fail to hit the intended mark on a couple of occasions, the film is clever enough to quickly hop on to the next running-gag. As with 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', every single character has a bit of eccentricity attached to them which they showcase in their own distinct ways. My pick among the set-pieces would certainly have to be the impressive 'Valkyrie flashback' which was shot using a technique known as 'Dynamic Light'. The climactic showdown is well-executed too: the apparent 'reincarnation' of Surtur being the cherry on top of the cake.The director has also ensured that franchise-regulars Odin (Anthony Hopkins in a cameo), Heimdall (Idris Alba) and Skurge (Karl Urban, excellent as always) made their presence felt. Loki is at his zany best all throughout and often towers over his brother, in terms of frivolity. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is by all means, exactly what the doctor prescribed in order to impart much-needed rejuvenation to the Thor franchise. Make sure you stay for the mid- credits (the post-credits really didn't add much) at least.Verdict: Seventeen films in, the MCU still has got what it takes to raise the excitement-levels of fans and casual viewers. 'Thor: Ragnarok' in particular, makes the titular character again feel integral to The Avengers, and teases 'Infinity War' in an amusing way."
22 January 2018,notom-23012,5,10,2,Comedic Action Film with ZERO Acting,"Stunned when I watched this sh*t.
1. Jeff Goldblum: 
Dear Jeff Goldblum - could you STOP. I've watched you acting (and really well) in 'Mister Frost' and (with jaws agape in) the Oscar-worthy but sadly neglected 'Adam Resurrected' - but since Adam Resurrected you haven't done a single original character movie. You are your own stereotype - unfortunately, it's the stereotypical Hollywood bullshit 'Well, I have my money, so I'll put in the least effort.' model. Kindly F*ck Off from our screens till ya can be bothered again. And Please don't get me started on your 'Jurassic Park' or 'Independence Day' - repeats of the your idea of a dithering 'genius'.
2. Direction:
Just who or more precisely, what was this Movie aimed at? Sociopaths?
Yes, We'd all show no emotion when our parents die, when friends we'd fought beside for thousands of years were wiped out. When our entire culture and civilisation were brought to ruin. Of course, this might reflect the entire 'stoic' repertoire of the actors... who knows - it's not like the writers gave them much manoeuvrability. (NOTE: Shoot Writers)
3. Timeline: 
You established that time within the 'Universes Dump' was far out of sync with the 'Normal' universe - a day in the 'dump' could mean hundreds of months or years in the 'Real' universe - so how come he arrives at Asgard just a couple of months into Hellas' reign? Lucky, I Guess.
4. Cheap Toilet Humour:
Well, ya missed a few shots here gents... ya didn't mention the word 'Cock' or 'Pussy' or 'Fart' - sure ya tried but couldn't quite fit them in - plus, ya missed references to the Anus... no, no I stand corrected - ya managed to get that particular US Fetish in.
5. I'm gonna end this review here... cos I just can't be bothered with the other sixteen points - like the Directors, Producers, Actor and, of course, the f*ckwits you call writers."

Don't pay movie prices to see it, instead, wait until it goes (quickly) to the $2 DVD section."
19 March 2018,mangakatanz,5,7,1,Generic MCU crap,"This movie is a perfect example of what the MCU has become.
This is just another superhero movie. Has no depth. If you just want a good laugh and some action sequences, go for it. But if you want a decent movie with emotion, character , and some depth, then this movie is a waste of time.
Thor Ragnarok represent what a generic MCU movie is like. I used to love the MCU movies but ever since they started making shit like this I'd not recommend anyone to watch such crap.
The movie pretty much follows the same formula:
Comedic Sequence
Action Sequence
Emotional sequence
repeat.
The fact that Odin dies and thor is just jumping around and laughing seems absurd. I'd say they did a poor job with the emotional spectrum and this is not what a superhero movie should be like."

Actors' accents made it even more absurd. The decorations and props were extremely poor even for a comedy movie. Monty Python and Army of Darkness had designing of much better quality, it's unbelievable. We are in a world of papier mache weapons, Styrofoam walls and plastic armor straight from the toy section of Walmarts. The Villain's outfit is basic af. Even this headpiece looks cheap... Darling, the Boulet Brothers serve more exciting outfits in they Friday night gigs. Such a talented cast, but the acting is next to non-existent. No chemistry between characters. Especially Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. You can see them thinking ""please make it stop, I need to go home"". And they even used a 16-bit music pack from the random video game. God, this movie is bad.I've never read the comic book, but I am shocked at the positive reception of this garbage."
28 September 2021,leqesai,11,24,9,What a fun ride,"I'll start by saying that I really didn't care for the first two Thor movies. Now that that's out of the way, I absolutely loved Thor: Ragnarok. From the visuals to the soundtrack to the plot and round to the characters this is a really fun movie. It starts on a high and crest-rides all the way to the end.We're introduced to interesting characters (some plot-integral and some side-dish) and a fantastic amount of colorful set pieces. Thor: Ragnarok is a significant improvement over the previous Thor movies and follows the Guardians of the Galaxy formula (make the movie fun and colorful, not drab and overly serious) to exceptional success.If you haven't seen Thor: Ragnarok because you were turned off by the first two movies you're missing out. This is the best of the three by a country mile."

                        ",Fine for what it is....,"Thor: Ragnarok (2017, Taika Waititi) In last years mega-hit film 'Captain America: Civil War' we saw pretty much all of the earthbound Marvel characters turn up except Thor and The Hulk/Bruce Banner. So now its time for us to see what they have been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a budget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters everywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks any emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that you might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many shortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor and Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more interesting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth' based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor a bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10"

The only problem I have is at some parts it seems very frustrating and out of place for Hulk to be in the movie. Overall, this is a great movie and it is worth a watch. Therefore, I would give it a 10/10 though some issues that get fixed with comedy."
20 October 2017,john310,65,200,1,Ragnawhok ??,"Starting from the basics.What does the title mean?From Wikipedia: In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. the fact that our film and characters are quite literally the same as those mentioned in the Norse mythology one would hope to see such cataclysmic disasters of monumental proportions on screen from ""The House of idea"" right? WRONG!! Well our characters have either gone fully insane or the performers were bound by contracts and buried under the pile of of cash that they didn't tried to borrow or adapt anything remotely from the source and that spelled Ragnarok (ironic in this case) for the film. The performances are trite and pathetic except for Hemsworth who showcases his natural talent of comic relief. He has proved time and again that he has the talent for what it takes to be a powerhouse and his boastful resume speaks of Rush,Thor, In the Heart of Sea, etc. But sadly the ""GOD of Thunder"" has been reduced to a self aware parody that only leads to ennui for the audience.This feels more like what the ""GOD of blunder"" would do.Mind you, this film is mostly targeted for children and teenage audience so humor, colorful C.G.I scenery which are glaringly obvious and plainly distracting in some cases in the film and retro infused soundtracks are enough on the platter to cater to them. Hulk's character is forced in the film as he doesn't feel natural midst all the chaos. Even his motion capture looks cheap as low budget corny effects.his struggling with his humanity and monstrosity sides has been sidelined and likely won't be addressed further as his presence in ANY film is just to have a bruiser to smash.Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie looks NOTHING like her comic counterpart since she should have been a tall musclebound warrior with sinewy physique not some glamour model walking the catwalk cos-playing her new Walmart sale. ODIN the all-father, one of the most powerful characters is conveniently sidestepped so as to circumvent his true potential like taking head on with Galactus the ""Devourer of Worlds"", taking a full on brunt from Silver surfer and Thanos and acting like nothing ever happened. But sadly Anthony Hopkins looks tired and bored to continue and even expressed disappointment regarding this very fact not once but twice!!Then why bother casting him in the first place??All in all a ""seen it all before"" repeating formulaic garbage from MCU. i don't understand how the director said in the first place this will be darker than all previous THOR movies. did i mention Karl urban was in it? Yes he was as forgettable as his character was that of a mindless grunt henchmen of Hela. No personality or development just boom boom pow."
20 February 2018,keithbet,3,5,6,Thor - still one of the least favourite heros,"Tried way to hard to be funny with a horrible music score, oversized props. A really disappointing mess!"
8 November 2017,Nielie10,11,21,10,Absolutely BrilliaNt,"Norse mythology is always a satisfaction to see portrayed on the big screen; but the name Ragnarök pounded fears in everyone's heart when it was just unveiled given that it means the death of the major Gods. This fright did not last because of the knowledge of Avengers: Infinity War that would feature our favourite hammer wielding, God of thunder Thor Odinson.Let's get to the movie.Following the announcement of Taika Waititi as director, I was both excited and wary but I've always put my trust in the MCU given their critically acclaim streak on the big screen (had to specify big screen). The movie was a fun, adventure, action-packed, endearing experience. It has only been out for a week in my country and I have already seen it three times (0.0004% of the box office total) - I have not suffered from diminishing returns but instead adding to my utility. I am elated that they ditch the gloomy tone and added this great humor to the franchise and it was largely due to the new characters. Elaborating on new characters: We've seen Thor and Loki four times in the MCU but they were new characters in this installment as we finally get to see Chris Hemsworth's true side (funny) and Loki was just as great. The antagonist Hela was also amazing, Hulk, Banner, Valkyrie, Grand Master etc. It was just a great spectacle.To conclude, I must give a special mention to Korg who I thought stole every scene he was in. The idea to use a soft voice for the ruffian looking rocked Alien (Krónan) was just astonishing; he was voiced by the director Taika too.Marvel Studios (MCU) - You've done it again."

The plot was really lame and it seemed to bounce all over the place. I honestly couldn't wait till it ended.

                        ",Underwhelming and Disappointing,"Director Taika Waititi takes the character in a drastically new direction, which wasn't exactly uncalled for. Like I said before, I find the Thor franchise to be the weakest MCU series, so reinventing the character is a smart idea. But the way that Waititi transforms him, and to what extent, really took me out of the movie. Thor is a bumbling moron in this film. He is not in the least bit competent. He's always cracking jokes, or tripping over something. It's slapstick comedy for a character who had previously been established as being a rather serious person with bits of comedy. But this was all comedy, to the point where it felt like an SNL parody sketch rather than a genuine movie. I did not believe for a second that Thor was capable of doing anything, because they made him out to be such an idiot. I appreciate them trying to adjust the character, but it felt more like an elseworld, Taika Waititi fan film than an actual Thor movie..."

In fact the whole movie floats only on the special effects (as a lot of Hollywood-movies do lately) and you must be childish to like this movie.

3 November 2019,tyreeseconroy,4,6,2,Thor Ragnasuck,Thor Ragnasuck is a huge step backwards from the first two Thor movies. This one is not serious and is in my opinion the stupidest film in the MCU (and THAT is saying a lot). The CGI is mediocre in this and the villain is shallow. Thor and Loki are stupid and there are some forced new additions in this movie. The action is taking a backs eat and I hated the final practical joke and the forced use of the Immigrant Song in the film. This was a very juvenile entry in the MCU kiddy series.2.9/10

In other words, something was telling me it was going to be a huge disappointment. That gut feeling was not wrong. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a poor attempt of superhero comedy, so poor infact that (like Spiderman: Homecoming) I couldn't bear to watch it all. I'm not sure why the writers decided to take it in the ""humorous"" (I use that term very loosely) direction that they did as all they achieved was to turn Thor into a parody of himself, totally ruining the character in the process. I just didn't get the need for all of the cheesy one-liners that peppered the film like cringe-worthy moments from a stand-up act gone wrong, it truly was unbearable after a while. As other people have said, the films events were supposed to have serious undercurrents but they were all delivered so carefree and joked about that there was very little for us as an audience to emotionally invest in, how can that be a good thing? I didn't care what happened to Thor, Asgard or anything, in fact I wanted everyone to die half hour into the film so I could do something more interesting like paint the fence. I have really been enjoying the MCU films for all these years up until the past two mentioned movies, they have just been plain awful and I really fear that Infinity War is going to go the same route. I hope to god it doesn't as, for me, it will just be a massive shame and a waste of such a good build up of 10 years' worth of excellent movies and story lines."
6 November 2017,WeeClaude,8,17,6,"Hela stupid! (Get it?) Thor 3 is good fun, but grossly overrated","I'll admit it: part of me loved Thor 3. I certainly got my $15 worth of action, spectacle and laughs from this movie. The trade-off was that I lost an equivalent 15 brain cells while watching this dumb schlock.My biggest problem with the movie? It's a comedy. Worse, a comedy based on the premise that characters such as Thor, the Hulk and Surtur are innately ridiculous and don't deserve to be taken seriously. The movie laughs at them, not with them.Why does this bother me? Because I've read and enjoyed the far more serious Thor comics written by Walt Simonson and J. Michael Straczynski. What Marvel has done here is take a bunch of those great comics, stitch them together into a clumsy Frankenstein's Monster of a plot, and add tons of corny punchlines. It's fun, yeah, but it sure ain't a 10/10 masterpiece.My ideal Thor movie would have a realistic, primitive, gritty feel - like Conan. And it would focus on the violent power politics of the Asgardian royal family - like Game of Thrones. Presumably, Alan Taylor was trying to do something like that with Thor 2, before Marvel re-edited that unfortunate film into one of their kid-friendly joke fests.The problem with the comedy approach is that nothing has dramatic weight. Several tragic things happen in Thor 3, but none of them carry any emotional impact. That's because, five seconds after every tragic event, someone cracks a joke. 5...4...3...2...1...joke! Whew, I was kinda sad about that major character's violent death for a moment there, but thankfully the emotion passed!Of course, there's nothing wrong with a film that's content to be light entertainment. Not everything needs to be violent or heavily emotional. But, I personally would've preferred a Thor sequel with more weight than this. Alas, Thor 3 takes the same campy approach as Batman & Robin - it merely has somewhat better jokes and special effects."

But, when this movie came out, I was thinking, ""Okay, here we go again."" Because I had gotten kind of bored with them. However, that boredom quickly turned into excitement and laughter. The balance was still there, but it had me laughing as hard as I did with Deadpool. Thor: Ragnarok was not what I expected from a Marvel movie. But oh my God. It was fantastic. I loved it."

29 October 2017,residentgrigo,8,24,5,2 hours of LSD colors and aggressively pointless nonsense,"Thor: Ragnarok is the 2nd worst MCU film after Iron-man 2. Taika Waititi sadly messed up real bad and 2017's other cape comedy Lego Batman -8,5/10- is objectively a more serious film! Which is fine but this self parody has exactly 1 good joke (Loki's reaction to Hulk), among about 300. The CG riven action scenes are utter crap and lack stakes. The licensed songs don't work, especially the twice used Zeppelin one. The drama is nonsensical and continuity with previous films is gleefully disregarded. And don't get me started on how much the film shows the comics the finger. Poor Hela, Skurge and planet Sakaar... The film is thus only held together by high production values and the A-list cast who all clearly had fun chewing the scenery. Long story short, watch it once and forget this 2 hour long music video within minutes.PS: Dear Disney, please reboot Thor next decade with the classic Walt Simonson run as the inspiration and keep the fantasy roots."
14 March 2021,grztxks,5,10,6,"Sorry, I've tried","Many people love this movie, they say it's the best Thor movie, for me it's the worse but also not a bad movie. Let's start with the positive sides, Hela is a great villain, who has great motives and is a real threat to Asgard. Also this movie looks so pretty with all it's colours. Thor and Loki, totally work again. But this movie has plot wholes and a to big character changing. Yes this movie is funny, but was Thor funny in his previous movies? I understand why many people like this but I think, for my taste it's just to big. The thing with Thor understanding his powers however was great."
19 November 2017,ivan_tobias,11,18,5,Not as good as advertised,"I went to see Thor Ragnarok with my wife yesterday which we then followed by Justice League and boy I am glad I stayed in the cinema for Justice League. Although I have never read a single comic I am a big fan of these kinds of movies as much as of any good sci-fi and this is what I think.Thor Ragnarok was over-hyped. It completely failed to bring any meaning or continuation of the story of Thor that was in line with all Avengers movies. It turned the once mighty god/alien being with snappy witty comments yet serious and important stance into a stupid moron with overly large ego who has no sense of danger or urgency. While Avengers combined the seriousness of the Winter Soldier and the wittiness of Iron Man, it did so based around the story with meaningful characters with real feelings and personal struggles and great team chemistry. This was even more apparent in the Guardians of the Galaxy that introduced an unlikely team of heroes with seemingly nothing in common that against all odds unites them and you feel for them. The comedy is then part of their quirks and personalities as well as situations but it is never overarching the threat of danger or urgency. Thor, on the other hand, was a collection of silly one-liners, a crap team without any chemistry and absolutely no sense of danger. Also, there was no feel for his world or people. At no point I cared about who his people are or why should they be saved or spared. They were just so disposable. Then there was the once menacing strong Hulk turned into a stroppy retarded babe, terrible Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum and the out-of-place appearance of Banner and Dr. Strange. Thor was sort of fun but disappointing, disposable and a forgettable movie that undermined the threat Avengers are going to face.Then we continued with Justice League which was a completely different story. I don't know whether it was the fact that it was made by Zach Snyder and director of the Avengers but this was in a different league. This was from the very first minute a grown-up movie. The story was great, the chemistry of the team was awesome. They felt like a new team, full of contrast and disagreements. The humour was spot on and mostly it was situational rather than forced. A lot of times thing were funny just through imagery rather than silly one-liners like in Thor, just as when Flash noticed that Superman can see him or the fact that Batman took ages to catch up with them because he has no superpowers. I loved the fact that they addressed the relationship with the mother or that Batman is getting old, or that Flash is inexperienced. I loved the fact that until the end I did not know whether Superman would actually step in and help them and showing the family in danger made me feel like the threat was actually real. Or about the fact that they addressed the elephant in the room that Wonder Woman is gorgeous and manipulated everyone with her charm (as it was the case with Cyborg). Overall, this was a better movie that perfectly fits in with the previous DC movies. Honestly, seeing the reviews before we saw the movies I felt like Thor would be better, that it would be like Avengers or the Winter Soldier combined with Guardians of the Galaxy, it failed to deliver. On the other hand, JL positively surprised and my wife who is not really into these kinds of movies said: ""Should we go and see it tomorrow again?"""
9 May 2018,yousif-727-364810,6,9,1,This movie is a joke; and the joke disappoints.,"The title pretty much sums it all up.According to the trivia, they improvised about 80% of the movie. Seriously? Doesn't that equate to not having a script at all? What's more, is that about just as much were the jokes! Yes, seriously. Of all the other MCU movies, they chose Thor, Hulk, and everyone else in the movie to make jokes, and ONLY jokes- even more so, way way more, than your friendly neighborhood Spider-man. The serious moments are rare, and the ones that are there, are weak.What about the jokes you ask? They were all bad, and cringy."

its so childish, no I take that back any kid can see through this like asking mommy or daddy why is she Drunk. she fell off the ramp.
you have none other than a drunk girl of all things being gloried to being funny. just like the one reviewer say.
you think all the people who lost a loved one to a drunk driver should think this is funny. I don't think so..
And please don't tell me its just a movie an we should lighten up yeah see if you can buy the heartache back from the loved one.
And she was driving or flying a space ship of some kind..oh yeah most definite that supposed to be funny.
one hour an about ten minutes trying very hard to be funny..Thor: Ragnarok"" is Not funny in-anyway-shape-or-form. bloody period.
even Mark Ruffalo"" said it. its not supposed to funny at all. you can have some humor but not over an hour of it. makes no sense. 
the only person that was good was Cate Blanchett (Hela) she excelled on every level. Chris Hemsworth looked like he was photo-shopped.
with all his muscles look very weird I tell yah. an the next one who was good is the Brick-layer guy (Korg) love his Tiny Voice.
director Taika Waititi"" though he was doing a remake of ""What We Do in the Shadows"" now that was funny from the opening scene. this is Not.
want to see a good movie see ""Coco"" or ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" 
you know I can't believe this wasn't flagged by the critics from its inception because THEY supposed to have the most brilliant minds. yeah okay.
well you get what you pay for I guess. This Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is a travesty of peoples delusion.."

28 February 2019,dp-17275,2,3,8,A great Thor film!,"'Thor Ragnarok' is the third Thor movie, and it's a great Thor film, arguable the best. The serious tone of the previous 2 films are disregarded in favor of a more comedic 'Guardians of the Galaxy' style. Thankfully this movie still feels like Thor and actually concludes the trilogy with Thor and Loki's relationship wrapping up in this one and giving a satisfying conclusion to the brothers arc. This movie gives a really good version of the Hulk who is very fun. This movie is overall just fun and that's all it really needed. The villain in this film is Hela who is a fun villain but like most of the Marvel villains, she is quite lackluster and dull. The scenes where Thor is on Sakaar are the best scenes in the movie, but the scenes on Asgard are quite dull and you don't want to stay there for long. The comedy is excellent and it's on of the funniest Marvel movies ever. It's villain is generic, it's plot is straightforward, the chemistry between actors is what helps this movie get off the ground, the fight scenes are brilliant. and the acting is spectacular. Highly recommend this one."
21 November 2018,jawneyfloros,3,7,10,Thor vs his sister,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that when the royals count just men and not women there is no guarantee what could happen. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
6 March 2021,Filmfanatic-261102,16,28,1,Thor is a complete Joke now...,"Joke after Joke after Joke. Remember when Thor was an almighty God who actually took things seriously? Yeah well forget that. It's like every second of the film every character is cracking up cringey jokes that aren't even funny. People are actually giving this film good reviews idk how but it doesn't surprise me with the amount of people who like Guardians of the galaxy which is equally just as cringe.This film and Endgame has completely ruined Thor for me, not at all looking forward to Love and Thunder as that looks like it's going to be a complete joke of a film as well. But it's Marvel and anything that the MCU produces marvel fans follow it like sheep ready to praise it, no matter how bad it is. This is coming from a person who actually likes most marvel films and the characters, but this was just a complete mess that ruined a great character, by making them into a joke."
24 March 2018,kosmasp,4,14,8,Third time's the charm,"Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven't seen ""What we do in the shadows"", I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it's more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it's always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it's Phase 3 already if I'm not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don't be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is"
22 September 2021,jeff-healey-fan,18,34,2,Well Disney was never known for quality,Just remaking and remaking Pinocchio and lion King and stuff for little kids. It just can't help itself. It bought marvel and now marvel is a joke aimed at kindergarten kids who compel mommy and daddy to buy Chinese made Disney toys.Thanks to Disney Thor is a stand up comic demigod!
24 April 2022,postofficecb,2,3,7,My favourite superhero film,"The reviews are all over the place with this film. People who adore serious yet poorly written Marvel movies (Avengers, etc.) tend to hate this. People with a great sense of humour love it. This review supports the latter and gives full credit to Taika Waititi, that special talent able to turn genres a bit on their side. Honourable mention goes to Thor, Jeff Goldblum's character, Korg, the insect guy, and Loki.That said, the movie could not escape the usual humdrum superhero banality of a storyline, and eventually left humour behind in Act 3 for a villain showdown with all the usual Marvel mayhem studio execs eat up. The only consolation is that Cate Blanchett still looks pretty good despite growing horns. At any rate, that's the trade off for good movie-making in the Marvel universe. That gives this a 7 instead of higher. Still, would watch again."
6 March 2021,neloangelo-66732,16,30,1,One dimensional movie,"It's just got no differentiating character thematics. Everyone's a comedian. They all have some sort of joke to tell in their dialogue. No one can be taken seriously. Every scene just has a comedic element to it. When you think you might be seeing a tradegy unfolding in a certain scene,or an emotional interaction now, or even a scene of suspense or out-of-nowhere moment, it is completely ruined by a comedic line or action. So you feel nothing for a character or a scene aside from laughter or annoyance. It really is just a one dimensional movie. A parody movie basically. Why did you take this direction with this movie? Cannot be enjoyed as a rollercoaster of a movie bit only a parody/comedy. Not good."
14 November 2019,BX80677G,6,9,4,I don't understand why this movie has such a high rating.,"This movie is really funny but overall nothing special, and also really forgettable after a few days.The only good thing i can say is that i really enjoyed to see Tessa Thompson, she really delivered."
18 February 2020,Offworld_Colony,2,4,10,"Thor Three is very much What We Do In The Shadows with capes. Wait, it did have capes in it. Well, you take my point.","Despite its adherence to the kooky, sometimes slapstick, sometimes realistic, always offbeat, kiwi humour, Ragnarok is also an out and out true fantasy; much more so than Guardians of the Galaxy with its space opera chops, Ragnarok delivers cloaked exiles trekking refugees across lush landscapes, fights inside trippy rainbow light bridges, posturing enthroned becrowned fire demons, the severed head of a gigantic guardian dragon, prog rock album art cover shots sprinkled liberally throughout and Mark Mothersbaugh's delicious score that flipflops between 80's nostalgia synth and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings. The lack of distinction between the magic and science mentioned in the first Thor movies finally lives up to the magic side of things; the opening and closing title logos almost as good as the film itself, not to mention the comic-con announcement/trailer typeface, all promising a coin-op arcade cabinet of a film that was eventually, actually, delivered.Thor: Ragnarok is a good example of liberal canon and yet also, about evolution of character; Thor, a waning, one-note, foppinsh, stiff do-gooder needing to find a new throughline above the macho sycophants and narcicists that rule the Avengers world. As such we're given an impressively short time on Earth and instead given a micro and macro level view of the workings of the planet Sakar, repurposed here from Planet Hulk to give us a greatest hits skim over deeper, more creative comic bokk source material. But the characters are allowed time to bond here; Thor's way of dealing with Banner and Hulk are hilarious and realistic, the idea that The Avengers just end up using each other is touched upon nicely here the film is allowed to explore the only superpowered Avenger who isn't pretending to be someone he's not. He's a hero and he bloody well knows it through and through, he doesn't have to put on a suit because his Dad didn't love him, he doesn't have to fight his darkside through Gamma exposure, he has to convince and rally those to the cause of good, only to discover (see Ragnarok) that it was good for him to do nothing. He can't fight nature, death and rebirth, because it is the universe. It's all these even if it is hidden, which makes a refreshing change.The film does have a problem with zipping all over the place like a saturday morning cartoon in its effort to (admirably) resolve a bunch of cameos and scenes from previous unrelated Marvel entries, but I suppose it's a refreshing twist to see the entire end credits sequence featuring Doctor Strange played out in full here, it almost feels like the most solid link between disparate films they've crafted yet.The film veers in to slaptick a little too often but when it is let off the leash to be full badass, my god does it go full badass: Thor actually using his lightning powers to decimate his foes; John Wicking his way through Draugrs and using his hammer to flee dirty great creatures and the clearly videogame-influenced ship battles involving characters jumping from ship to ship to disable them directly. A wholly appropriate smattering of Led Zeppelin got my fist and heart pumping and a smirk on my face that said: ""Well done Thor Ragnarok, well played.""But the fact that this film is having so much fun and invites you along to have it too, only makes the misfires all the more bitter: Take Tessa Thompson for example, there's no doubt she was having fun, but her acting style of looking smug and fighting with a truly distracting and hard to understand BRITTOSH(tm) accent, was only the icing on the cake for her character who had no proper catharsis and no moment of a real ending or closure to her story. The fact that she was hired in as the kick-ass female(tm) and not warranted properly and woven in properly cheapened her immensely.Also missed is all the weight and depth and aching, ponderous beauty from Hulk and co. from Planet Hulk - It wouldn't be hard to shoehorn it in to a later entry, but losing Meek and his history and personality from PH and the relationship between Korg and Hulk in PH were particularly standout in comics and were weak here. I suppose there was the faintest hint of the relationship between Valkyrie and Hulk/Banner but it misses some of the most beautiful and impactful nuances of the romantic relationship of PH.I also think more time and attention could have been spent on some of the CGI. Because Taika stages the extras and physicasl backgrounds so well, Asgard has never felt so real unlike most of the other Marvels that suffered from acute greenscreenitis. The CGI background work and sets are generally excellent which means sore thumb sequences such as CGI Hela fighting off the hoardes reminded my of Matrix Reloaded's plasticky blandness, and some of Hulk's moments were played far away with emphasis on acting and movement, leaving a lingering desire to want to see a few close ups of Hulk talking to build a stronger sense of connection and to tame my curiosity as to how they made this Hulk tick.One of the stronger aspects is the strong, almost resolution, to Loki's story. He is the brother in this film and the story deserves him, unlike The Dark World, and it deserves to explore brotherhood in it considering their connection to Hela. Hela is given enough to do, is charismatic enough and has motivation and backstory etc etc but she ends up being mixed bag. Due to the speed and globetrotting nature of the film, she feels like an immovable object, taking 90 minutes to make her way from the rainbow bridge to the warehouse of antique relics. Had she been employed as someone in the way of their journey and not just waiting for them to get back the way Guardians 2 managed to do, it might have not felt like a film of two halves.Anthony Hopkins is another symptom of the film playing catch up with the decisions of prior titles; he starts strong, but really, he's Loki at that point, and when he's himself he is detached and is glossed right over. The emotional side never plays out properly and the best parts of the film's themes are left unexplored. The colonial idea that Odin paid for the vast beauty of Asgard with his bootheels over the countless other worlds is a fascinating and a surprisingly obvious one. It came out of leftfield, but was not unwelcome and tied directly to the titular Ragnarok, smacking nicely of the Crusades. It was powerful and smart but it left Odin unaccountable as he turned in to gold dust and disappeared, there's not enough running time or clever scripting to have Thor or Loki deal with the fact that their empire and their father dealt in so much bloodshed. Maybe if his parting speech made more sense in retrospect instead of being wishywashy forgettable claptrap.However. When a film make a conversation about a vampire stake weapon so deftly that I can't breathe through the laughter, or when Thor waxes about how much he loved snakes and how Loki played a prank on him as children that's so funny I think I'm going to die. When cameos are so brazen and stupid they feel like they belong in Anchorman not Marvel's throwaway Avenger, then the film manages to fully and wholly redeem itself.The films goofy charm is awash with 80's music and glam rock villains and it's no small feat for it to be, for me, the film I wanted Guardians to be when I first watched it. It's the film I like as much as everyone else seemed to like Guardians. Ragnarok isn't as emotional, but I like it more. I liked the Hulk/banner transformation that stirred me, I like that its influences and taste are less crass and more kiwi, and it wasn't the plethora of slapstick humour that kept me laughing alone, it was the conversational, humanising dialogue amidst this alien, fantastical world. And the fantastic array of acting doing its best to make it the most unique entry in to Marvel's machine. And its Taika's little details, the use of Pure Imagination, the destruction of all the hero tropes in to childish, playing-action-man-with-your-mates moments, that prove that a strong director can push past the Marvel factory and yet still play ball enough not to get fired ceremoniously or unceremoniously.Thor: Ragnarok:It's fist pumping hero action. The third act is fun, doesn't feel out of place, comes at the right time and flows well. It's a blink and you miss it, eye popping, influences on its sleeve, side-splitting, niche humoured blockbuster and it's highest compliment is it embodies its themes; it is true franchise Ragnarok: destruction of the known and previously seen, to facilitate a rebirth, of relationships, of what a visionary can bring, of what a film should strive to be, a rebirth of good blockbuster cinema.A Saturday morning cartoon based off of a Final Fantasy game set in the world of Star Wars and soundtracked to Led Zeppelin. Depth, creativity, it's own comedic voice and exactly be best example of what these movies can be."

                        ",Asgard is the people..,"The best out of the 3 three thor movies. Full of laughter, light heartedness and one of the best MCU movies. A similar formula used in Guardian's of the Galaxy.Very good story that takes some minimum inspirations from World War Hulk a Marvel comic series. The writing and acting were great. The charcters are decent. We got Valkyrie, the last of the elite guards of the throne. Thor has developed greatly in the last 3 movies, wiser and much calmer. And a pretty good antagonist, Hela , Thor's sister. And with amazing CGI and likable music.An enjoyable film..Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe.."
14 March 2019,vjnambu,2,4,9,Entertaining and best Thor movie,"Though I liked Chris hemsworth as Thor, I was not any fan of Thor standalone movies. While Thor 1 was strictly okay, Thor 2 was one of the most weakest films of MCU. But in Thor ragnarok Thor franchise gets completely revamped.
Ragnarok format is same like iron man 3. Like in iron man 3 we saw what tony can do without his suit, in Thor ragnarok we can see what Thor can do without his hammer. Despite all the worst things happening to Thor in this one(loses his father, hammer,eye and Asgard kingdom) there is a lot of humor in this one.
When a serious character does humor, his fan following increases like never before. Same has happened with Chris hemsworth whose fan following as Thor has increased leaps and bounds with ragnarok. Though he deliberately does not be funny, situations make it so. With film by film our love towards Loki increases only. So has happened in ragnarok. The bromance between hemsworth and tom Hiddleston is the highlight. Cate blanchett gives a menacing performance which makes hela one of the best villains in MCU. Tessa Thompson was badass as Valkyrie. And last but not the least, I never liked hulk before but with ragnarok I finally started loving him. Seriously the film becomes most entertaining with the entry of hulk.
The music is foot tapping. Only drawback I felt was some portions are dull when Thor is trapped in sakaar. But with the entry of hulk this becomes a hilarious entertainer. Full credit goes to director taika watiti for ressurecting the thor franchise.
On the whole Thor ragnarok may not be the best MCU film but is definitely the most funniest MCU film ever made."
6 November 2017,thevipinsingh,7,17,10,The best Marvel movie till date,"Since its first trailer, I knew that this movie is going to be epic.

4 May 2019,tabuno,3,9,8,"A Fun, Light-Minded Superhero Summer Movie","Chris Hemsworth gets to play a rather nicely cynical superhero God that in some ways reflects the humanistic Gods of Greek and Roman literature. This mostly entertaining at and times funny action-adventure is roughly hewn in its screenplay's comedic and dramatic elements. A pleasant, if not truly substantive and deeply engrossing experience. But as a fun summer get away, Thor seems to fit the bill."

It wasn't a disappointment in the slightest. We get Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as well as Jeff Goldblum (in a better role than Independence Day: Resurgence) and lots of colorful sets and powerful effects. The director did a fine job with this film and it's good for a trilogy-closer. I wasn't bored in the slightest. To be honest, I liked this better than The Dark World (Thor's second outing). It's more memorable too."

                        ",Horrendous,"It takes an awful lot for me to not like a fantasy movie. Ragnarok succeeded, though. I'm convinced that this project was written and directed by toddlers. The cringe factor of the dialogue alone is off the charts. The action is good but the FX are decidedly not. It could have been SO good but it's a bad, bad movie. So glad I didn't shell out to see this in a theater."
6 June 2018,mike-97420,6,11,1,"Yuk,..really bad","Who writes this stuff. The stories are getting worse and I have no idea what is going on? I used to love superman moivies and Si Fi as you could follow the plots at least they made sense. This is all special affects and no story. I can't even get enthused about writing a creative review because these movies are terrible. 54 minutes in and I'm bored with 116 to go. Nope not going to happen. What is this supposed to be about? Woody Wood Pecker cartoons were better when I was a kid. Over paid actors, writers and directors make for a 180 million dollar mess of a movie."

The actors are amazing in this and the director (Taiki Waiti) has done an amazing job perfecting the comedy in this film. If you ever need a marvel film to cheer you up, this is for you because it is to funny."
11 November 2017,hiyangbo,5,9,5,nothing other than entertaining,"If you would like to spend 2.5 hours only for a few laughs, go for it. It's nothing other than entertaining. I really cannot understand why Watchmen have a IMDb score of 7.6 which is way deeper than this and way more worthy, while this one gets a higher score 8.2. The story itself is very dull."
1 November 2017,aryassen,10,24,5,Why the silly jokes? Why?,"So far, they have managed to make a good(ish) balance of light and sinister moments, but in this instalment, the scales tipped waaay too much into the silly jokes side. I'm not an expert on Ragnarok, but I remembered it to be the end of Asgard, it's gods, and most of the ""world"" as we know it. Death, destruction and sorrow, followed by a thin ray of new hope over the ruins. How did they think that they can turn this into a joke, and that it would work? Throughout the story,the embarrassing jokes just kept coming, to the extent that often I felt I'm actually watching a silly sitcom. Don't get me wrong: I expected some light-hearted fun and banter during the build-up to the final battle (what Ragnarok is supposed to be), but then I thought it would turn into a dark, epic, moving, bloody but heroic finaleinstead, we have some of that, but broken to pieces by cheap jokes. Honestly, I'm not sure even a 10 year old would enjoy this mixture. The missus really likes Thor (big surprise there, I know), and even she was looking at me in pain many times, rolling her eyes. I know some of the previous two episodes had some silly moments, but trust me, not like this: it is a whole new level.The critics seem to love it though, explaining things into it I don't see in there (I'm sure it is my fault). I liked the previous two Thor movies (with all their obvious flaws), but this, I'm not sure if I will even buy later (as I used to, to complete the set on the self). For me, this was really disappointingPS: I actually liked the ""80's science-fiction"" look & feel (sets, costumes, music) present in many of the scenes, though it seems to be disjointed (again...) with the previous movies. Wonder how the younger generations (without fond memories) feel about that."
8 November 2021,ryfin,6,14,7,"Great MCU Movie, Such an Improvement to Thor","After re-watching the original Thor, I was very surprised that I found the movie boring and his character somewhat bland. I remember nothing about the Dark World movie. I did not care much for Thor when this came out, but wow did this shock me. A ton of humor, which at some points is slightly much, but overall 90% of the jokes land very well. Hulk was also one of the MCU characters I cared least for, but this movie treats him surprisingly well. Hella has a great design, but could have a little more character since she poses more as just an obstacle for Thor rather than a true villain. In the end, this movie is just a great improvement for the Thor franchise and has really made me a fan of Taika Waititi. One of the best MCU movies!"
20 February 2018,damagecasek,6,10,3,What the hell is this?!,"That was my reaction after watching 10 minutes of this movie. Without getting much into spoilers and story... Ill just give you my take.This is probably the weakest Marvel movie. Thor's story, character etc has always been powerful and uplifting. This doesnt look like a Thor movie at all. Its comedy is awful and forced. The characters dont get any scope. The action, CGI and storyline is generic. It seems like Marvel Universe is now making filler movies in between to reach the Avengers finale.What did I find positive about this? Nothing. Its not deadpool. Its not Spiderman. Its probably got Guardians of the Galaxy vibe and looks odd. Dont watch it."
22 March 2018,roberttimbre,4,6,3,What a disappointment,"Having really enjoyed the Marvel Universe, I began to feel a little disappointed by Guardians 2, the third iteration of Thor has really dented the illusion. This time round the script is weak, with far too heavy an emphasis bent toward humour, but achingly lazy childish humour, that is repeated far too often. Hemsworth's physique too seems to fluctuate betweeen being heavily bulked up to being significantly not, (obviously not filmed in sequence) Equally there was no character development,with the few new characters having been poorly imagined to the extent that there was no story to carry them. It seems as though they have thinned the cream too much. No intrigue, no tension, no compelling narrative. Perhaps this is the being of the end, perhaps Hemsworth told them he wanted out and is contracted to this and Infinity War. So will we see the demise of Thor in Infinity War. As with all things everything runs it's course. Nolan knew this with the Dark Knight Triolgy leaving us wanting more."
4 November 2017,axnjxn1701,6,12,6,Unimpressed and goofy... Good attempt though.,"As a devout and I mean DEVOUT Marvel fan, I am so confused at why they went super 'goofy' on this movie? Surprisingly unimpressed... Didn't expect such a great storyline to be so boring. It was good entertainment, just seriously unimpressive and almost lost in value for being anything 'epic'. I think what happened, that was so surprising is the effort to copycat the humor from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' which was so successful in it's own light. Here, Marvel tries this with all the gods of power and it just seems aloof in sincere value. Loved the 'human' elements they put in here but this movie is confusingly uninspiring to say the least. Looking at the Marvel universe, there IS a need for this humor but the silly-stupid character from Jeff Goldblum - does not work as an example. There are numerous unanswered questions in this movie and I feel it'll be picked apart once the hype settles down a bit.Some really weird introductions, and odd separations from good storytelling make this movie very mixed on quality. I am trying really hard to enjoy this film over a day away from watching this; but sadly, I just don't think this is one that needs to be rushed out to go see..."
13 September 2018,southdavid,2,5,8,Molijnir to perfect.,"A second viewing of the film, following the home video release shows that though still highly enjoyable, the film was perhaps so memorable that the rewatch suffered in comparison. The demise of Odin releases the shackles that have held Hela, The Goddess of Death, (Cate Blanchett) imprisoned for centuries. A short battle on Earth sends Hela back to Asgard, whilst Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are cast out of the Bifrost to Sakaar, a planet run by ""The Grandmaster"" (Jeff Goldblum) who insists that Thor must defeat his champion in order to earn his freedom. I loved this film on my first viewing. Seeing the capacity that Chris Hemsworth has to be funny it was a masterstroke to take a cue from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and broaden Ragnorok into a genuine comedy. It's a fabulously written movie, the story gives everyone a chance to be comical, but in a way that make sense and allows for both Thor and Loki to finish their character arcs and accept who they are. It also introduces some new characters that will hopefully reoccur in future movies; Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie, a drunk former defender of Asgard and Director Taika Waititi motion captures Korg, a freedom fighter made of rocks. It's actually pretty amazing, in retrospect, how it manages to legitimately include so many characters without making any of it feel forced. The music is also fantastic, from both the 80's inspired Synth score and the use of licenced songs. It looks amazing too, one of the best looking films of the MCU. Sakaar and Asgard are very different Alien worlds but both look fantastic. The fight scenes are all terrific, logical and well shot. So why not a perfect score. Like most comedies, it's not as funny the second time around and much of Ragnorok is based around surprises and cameo's which obviously have less impact the second time. In light of Infinity War too, the film takes on a more bittersweet conclusion.Ragnorok is a brilliant addition to the MCU and really shows the potential that they have to fully exploring other film genres, whilst remaining a ""superhero"" film. (Add on another star if you haven't seen it)."

24 December 2018,undeaddt,2,4,7,"I cringed at first, but then I got on with it.","As the movie started and as I saw the first scene, I thought, this is so not Thor-like, I hate overreacted humour, this will make me cringe throughout the whole movie. BUT, it was not the case, yes, I did not like the humour moments, well most of them, but all in all, this is, if not, the best Thor movie out of the trio. Visually, it surpassed all expectations, it is astonishing, especially the last 30 minutes of the movie. Storywise, it is unic, different, modern and epic at the same time, Thor and Loki show how big of a chemistry they have between them and why we love Loki, even tho he is a bad guy overall."
26 December 2018,guidirtheatre,2,2,7,Poor execution of a great tale,"Shame...this movie had such potential to be a serous work of art...but no, these people meddling made it too much of a joke all the time. i like happiness and some laughs in a movie but this is more of a joke than anything else.Could be a serious tale like the lord of the rings with better casting and a more serious tone to it."

7 November 2017,lschouder-04582,13,27,7,One of Marvel's worst films,"What's wrong with this film is what was wrong with Batman Forever; no one involved with this movie is taking it seriously. It's all just a big joke which means the audience can't take the film seriously which means there are no stakes; nothing that happens matters or makes us feel anything. Thor doesn't act like Thor. He's absolutely unrecognizable from the other films. He acts like Star Lord instead and fails to be someone worth rooting for. Even Hela can't seem to muster any emotion. She was just freed after thousands of years of captivity and she's not even angry. She just smirks the whole movie. No one expresses an iota of feeling in this movie. It's like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. It's fun but there's no weight behind it. Humor is good in a movie but to make a good film you need to balance those elements. This film had humor and action and nothing else. It felt as empty as an 80's action film like Cobra or Red Heat. It wasn't even a Thor movie. It was really Guardians of the Galaxy with different characters, which is not what Thor IS."
22 January 2019,mardalsfossen01,2,4,9,Entertaining!,"With many negative reviews popping up on IMDb and after watching the first few sequences, I sensed this movie would turn out to be really bad.
But guess what, it was actually entertaining! There even are quite a lot of scenes I loved and will remember. Also it felt like it wasn't too draggingly narrated which often is a problem in movies.
The cast was great, I loved the known ones just as much as the new ones like Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi. Great new characters!
This one's definitely better than the two previous Thor movies and more entertaining than most other movies of the MCU until release of 'Thor: Ragnarok'."

12 March 2021,bpuccia87,7,14,6,Mediocre at best,"Honestly, I don't get the extremely positive reviews. This was probably MCU movie I least enjoyed. When you hear or read ""Thor: Ragnarok"", those who actually studied or read about what Ragnarok means, would imagine a dark and dramatic film, not an over-the-top forced comedy and especially not one showing Thor, the god of thunder, being punked by 75% of the cast in the film. The Hela and Odin parts were interesting and I kinda wished the film followed that direction, but instead, it spiraled into a superhero comedy."

                        ","""good""","In the seemingly never ending saga of superhero movie this one manage to stand out. They've finally figured out how to make one that's not so boring. Every scene is a setup for the next punchline it makes it bit more fun but it also makes it forgettable. I'm not really huge on the comedy, except for Taika's character, he's actually pretty funny and only funny because he's a kiwi and yes sometimes the jokes are overdone. Not much has changed story wise, it's still the same thing about family feud and revenge and other boring things. Not a fan and never a fan of the big CGI fight, they're dull and tedious. On the big picture though, this movie is a step in the right direction."

26 November 2019,davidmvining,2,5,7,Colors! Funnies! A decent antagonist! Just enough story to tie it all together!,"Well, that's certainly nice to have.What makes this movie work is its sense of outlandish fun which seeps into every part of the filmmaking process. From the script to performances and even set design and special effects, the movie prioritizes being fun over anything else. I think it muddles some of the basic storytelling elements, but not enough to actually drag the movie down that much.Thor is away from Asgard trying to prevent a recurring dream he's been having of Ragnarok taking place and wiping out his home world, so he has come to find Surtur, the demon who will perform that apocalypse and defeats him in battle. Upon returning to Asgard, he discovers that Odin is not Odin but Loki in disguise. Taking Loki with him, they find Odin and discover that their never mentioned (honestly, for good reasons within the narrative) older sister, Hela the goddess of Death, has been waiting for the power within Odin to dissipate with his death to return and lay claim to Asgard. Thor and Loki get cast out and land on a trash covered planet where Thor gets roped into gladiatorial games that have been using the Hulk for the past two years. Thor teams up with Hulk, Loki, and a long drunk Valkyrie to escape the planet, go to Asgard, and eventually give the planet up to Surtur in an effort to save the people of Asgard over the place itself.That second to last sentence above? That's about an hour of the film, and it was the core of my reticence of the film's efficacy as a story. There's a thick layer of humor and fun over that hour, but I didn't quite understand the purpose of it narratively. Perhaps too much time is dedicated to the Hulk, who carries much of the humor and subplot within that hour, but ultimately the hour does serve a narrative purpose. Thor begins the film trying to prevent Ragnarok as heir to the throne of Asgard, and he ends the film as king of Asgard while triggering Raganarok. That's quite a journey, and it felt like most of that came in the final act when he faces Hela and realizes the scope of the danger she represents. However, the full hour in the middle does show the other part of Thor's journey, that of him becoming king. It's done with brightly colored sets, costumes, and lots of humor, but it's still there. Thor starts with nothing and ends that hour with a following. He starts the process of learning how to apply the lessons Odin had taught him about being king and developing relationships with people to create loyalty in a populace. It's not the focus of that section, the humor definitely is, but it raises the humor from being merely fun into actually serving the story to some degree (I still think this could be stronger).But the movie is really only trying to be fun, right? Its only purpose is to make you smile for two hours, right? Well, it's still trying to tell a narrative story, and it's valid to judge the film's merits on that level. It would be find if the movie only wanted to make us laugh, then it could be a sketch show of two hours and it could work quite well at that, however the film does have characters, a plot, and a theme at its core. To ignore that all in favor of just the giggles is a disservice to the film as a whole.From Korg, the rock monster, to Thor's new flippant attitude, to Skurge's pride in his stuff (like ""Des"" and ""Troy""), the movie wishes primarily to provide light entertainment and it succeeds quite well at that. It also does that in a vividly visual design sensibility that uses color in set design unlike anything Marvel had done before. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies started the bright, cosmic, colorful trend in visual storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Thor: Ragnarok takes it in a direction with more straight lines and clear delineation between the colors. It creates a unique look both in and out of the MCU. The use of music is also similar to that in Guardians, but the influences are of a different era and style (a good helping of Led Zeppelin, for instance) that gives Ragnarok an entirely different energy.The acting is quite entertaining throughout, with no one quite taking their roles too seriously. Chris Hemsworth is having a blast as Thor, Tessa Thompson is happily drunk as Valkyrie, Mark Ruffalo is appropriately befuddled as Banner, and Cate Blanchett is sexy and appropriately hammy as Hela. Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable, but there was definite room for tightening the narrative a bit."
2 November 2017,Quinoa1984,4,16,8,"a director totally in sync with his cast - one of the funniest movies of the YEAR, nevermind MCU","In brief: this was a damn space craft full of fun. Thor Ragnarok is Douglas Adams by way of Jack ""King"" Kirby, both from his Thor run and other (MANY) space fantasy comics in look and brawny, iconic feel (and this time, maybe the first time, Larry Lieber gets a screen credit!) Waititi is stupendous with his actors and they give back in kind.If only the action wasn't so been-there-done-that (or maybe it's the CGI being so overwhelming that it consumed the actors in some shots). That said, this continues the goofy-but-serious space-operatic look from the Guardians movies, and it ups the stakes from the previous Thor movies - it's *easily* the superior of the three, the most human and with a more interesting villain(ess), though I wish Blanchett were in it a wee bit more, not to mention Waititi himself playing a rock monster with a droll sensibility - so it stands out from the pack very easily. Even Thor gets an arc this time, which was fairly typical if there at all, and I don't even know if there was one in The Dark World (that movie was so forgettable I didn't recall what happened to Odin at the end of that story.Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner gets fun stuff to do throughout (he gets to talk, a lot, this Hulk, so take that what you will), and everyone gets a moment to shine, from Tessa Thompson to Karl Urban (mostly his arc is serious, but he starts off the movie with a terrific jokey scene), to even the whoever-she-is that has to work as the Grandmaster's secretary. It's not as emotionally full of depth as the Guardians series, but I did also appreciate where the movie ends up as far as the fate of Asgard; even if it's a small way, it felt like Marvel taking a real chance - the first time they did something like that since Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin, and like that it works - and while, again I must stress, much of the action doesn't carry much consequence, as a comedy with that spirit of Adams (from Hitchhiker's Guide AND Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, I almost forgot till a friend reminded me Odin and Thor and Loki were in that), it's firing on as many cylinders as the other MCU movies this year. It's a breezy, wild space adventure. It knows its audience, and it gives winks and nods to how silly it all may be, but when it needs to be serious it can do that too (or at the least, Cate Blanchett gets to chew on some scenery, but not all of it, if you catch my drift - she knows what she's in and is having the time of her life in a way I haven't seen since Crystal Skull)."

And then there was the comedy factor, some people might not like it, but I'm a big fan of that. It's what makes Thor: Ragnarok better than the rest.

Having said that i think the Loki personage was perfectly nailed by the actor from the start of the MCUs' movies, I would not want another actor playing the Loki role, and IMO this actor deserves an Oscar to play so well as Loki.Thor is played at its best as well as Hulk and the Valkyrie.
In this movie we might have the top 10 of the best main actors in the Marvell universe.

And why is the Hulk even in this film The best moments in the film are when Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett are on the screen.The script is pathetic and all over the place. Is this about Asguard's peril of being ruled by an evil and sadistic queen, or is it some 80's buddy comedy with high school humor that is much like that of Beavis and Butthead. An I believe that's why it appealed to a lot of the guys, who often sound just like Beavis and Butthead.While the first two Thor films had their issues, at least they tried to remain true to the character. This one uses the name ""Thor"" but that's all.

However after I spent the hours of watching, I would like to say that it was an okay movie but not really something really memorable.Aside of the stunning CGI, the humor are pretty much not as hilarious as usual. They still are funny, but some came to be failed though.The plot were pretty predictable, and it was lack of depth. I would not put things in detail since it will be a spoiler but overall, it did not impress as much as other Marvel's project this year. The villain was cool, but the battle and how they get the victory was pretty, how would I say it, not as thrilling as I expected.As the sum up, this movie was more to 'classic super hero plot where the hero get some problem then gain incredible improvement in his power then win the battle' thing than something with surprise and lack of depth or plot development aspect. But it will still be a good movie for you to watch at home on your laptop while needing something entertaining as a companion."
6 January 2018,s-00292,7,10,1,Expensive parody of itself,"If you're an adult and like Deadpool ""humor"" this might be for you. If you're a kid, you probably like pretty colors, lots of characters, and wackiness.As a movie though, it's like this one has too many ingredients and no time to make sure everything fits together and has cooked properly. Exactly like kids making their dinner on their own, and then end up with a mess everywhere and giggle about it.Maybe it's because the writers were given an impossible task, like telling a chef to use everything inside a mall for one dish. ""You can't put cat litter in food"" -sure you can, it fits in the pot and we've already paid for it.The result is busy introducing new characters, fierce characters doing stupid stuff, all the while trying to keep the story intact and then giving up, which is the actual ending of the movie.There were many things along the way that showed like they struggled with the mess and took easy solutions with their hands up. Dialogs shot with experienced actors, which gave serious Owe Boll vibes and should have been rewritten, reshot, or left on the cutting room floor. And how do we solve the problem of getting the God of Thunder captured? With a bug zapper. Next problem."

We've been following Hulk and Thor for ages, why do we still need to hear the same lame puns, see the same overused visual ""gags""? It's not even slapstick comedy, it's stupid. The movie's not unwatchable, but why would you ruin everything you were trying to build with those -not so good- characters to begin with? Please leave this to Deadpool, even the stupid GoG2 proved you have to draw the line somewhere. Why is Loki such an inconsistent idiot? Why are we spoonfed everything? It even manages to assume the audience are a bunch of dumdums for example by using the same ""i forgot what my powers are, oh a convenient vision"" twice, ruining the twist (or whatever it was supposed to be). Bonus points: if you've seen the trailers, don't bother watching the movie, you've already seen everything. For the post credit scene, it's on youtube."

What made this work was it didn't take itself too seriously, and neither did the audience. Lots of good special with an above average script with decent acting all around. Blanchett just blew me away as the big sister who really could rule Asgard, but only to the detriment of everyone who does not accept her rule. After this, you really have to believe that she really could play anything. Worth catching."

This film didn't ring with me as it seemed to do with, well, everyone else. There is no denying the humour and action are well played but I'm struggling to care now. It's comic movie fatigue.The main aspect that kept my attention was Loki, who as ever stole the show although Cate Blanchett as the lead villain was also exceptional but was given little depth. The rest didn't work. Jeff Goldblum played a camp villain straight out of the Fifth Element, and it failed badly. Lots of other characters were simply not engaging, and the cross over cameos has become a cliché and annoyance. They should have spent more time on Cate Blanchett's character.The humour could be good as it is self deprecating, but can fall too often into back slapping. Enough to keep you entertained though.For the more avid Marvel comic book geek this is a great film, but for all else it will leave you a little ambivalent."

The cast is perfect, Hemsworth gorgeous and ironic, Blanchet deliciously over the top, Goldblum a gem... and the rest of the cast too.
Great and courageous choice for Marvel to allow an unconventional kiwi director to take the franchise in an unexpected direction, exposing (and playing and having fun) the ludicrous nature of the whole concept of the Big Man with the Big Hammer.
Absolutely delicious.
My vote is 8 1/2"
27 November 2018,jtindahouse,2,6,8,Waititi's style works perfectly to fix the usually bland marvel universe,"I'm certainly not big into marvel movies, but this one I had to see considering it was directed by New Zealander Taika Waititi. I'm a big fan of Waititi (as a film director at least, he could use a little work as a human being on occasion). I like the style he brings to his films. He combines heart and warm-feeling with hilarious comedy in a seamless manner. I think it was a brilliant decision to bring him into the marvel universe because if there's one thing these films have all been to date it's dry and uninteresting. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is anything but.The film moves at a break-neck pace. The action begins immediately and it never lets up. At times it feels more like a comedy film than any other genre. Every character (barring perhaps Cate Blanchett's) provides endless humour that is all perfectly written and delivered. The funniest character of all 'Korg' was actually played by Waititi himself.Even though I understood almost none of the storyline references (I still couldn't actually tell you what Ragnarok was by the end of the film I'm embarrassed to say) I still managed to have a great time and enjoyed this film even more than I expected to. If Waititi directs any more marvel films I'll be there on opening night happily."

26 July 2018,lambgary444,3,6,1,Bad casting welcome back cheesy movies,This is like the old Batman movies with Jim Carrey absolutely terrible and cheesy I guess that is what they were going for. They have a woman who is 5 foot 4 playing a Valkyrie and now anybody can beat up Loki with ease. The writing stupid a 7th grader would not have made the mistakes they did. Thor is basically a wimp thru the movie he can't beat the tiny Valkyrie or the hulk and there are two villains and one of them is Jeff Goldblum really !? The writing was all over the place along with the bad casting they turned this into and old 1970 or 1980 cheesy movie they had Thor begging and whinnying it was the worse super hero movie of the 21st century. I would have given this zero stars but the lowest it will let me go is 1. Hey on the bright side if you are between the ages of 5 and 10 you might like this can't be sure because they have gotten used to good movies I hope if they make another the do not hire the same director the same producer the same casting agent or the writers... Did the writers even see the other movie's ? They embarrassed the franchise and the critics want to pick on Ben Affleck when they had enough garbage here to last them a life time if you have not seen this don't it will make you hate the franchise and trust me you have not missed anything.
6 November 2017,joelwaalkens,11,21,2,Cute comedy,"As a comedy in the stripe of Adam Sandler or Will Farrel, the movie was a success. Unfortunately I went to see a super hero action film. As an action film it was very poor. I wanted so much to love this, the previews made this a must see movie. Maybe if I hadn't gone in expecting a 10, I would have more generously given this movie a 3 or 4 but it is the avengers series, with so many great movies in the lineup I just didn't expect this one to stink so bad. The action, where it was present, was good. The story, when they weren't poking each other in the eyes or hitting each other with pies in the face, was good. It was just so rare that they bothered with telling a story instead of doing slapstick comedy. I love comedy, I truly do, I loved Deadpool, because it was so fitting for the character, but Thor yukking it up with one liners with Hulk? No, no thank you."

5. Easily the weakest of the Thor movies, but really only suitable for any 12-15 boys in your household"
21 January 2019,Mike_Devine,2,5,7,"A fun, entertaining rebirth of the 'Thor' saga","Ever since Disney acquired the rights to the Marvel franchise, there have been signs of change in the films that have released compared to earlier efforts. 'Thor: Ragnarok' stands out as an example of a film that feels very different from its two predecessors, as it's closer to a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' vibe than a 'Captain America' one. This is true despite the fact that it revolves around Thor's quest to thwart the destruction of his homeland of Asgard at the hands of the evil war goddess Hela (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett).'Ragnarok' is fun, yet dark. Campy, yet mature. A lot of this is likely influenced by its director, Taika Waititi, who is able to bring out more character in each actor. While Blanchett is easily the best part of 'Ragnarok,' Chris Hemsworth once again picks up his hammer and delivers a performance that is anything but wooden. Other standouts include Tessa Thompson, whose Valkyrie is the perfect sidekick for Thor, while Tom Hiddleston is his usual mischievous self as Loki. And then there's Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is quite possibly the oddest individual ever conceived for this series. 'Ragnarok' also does a good job of continuing to weave together others from the Marvel universe, from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to the boring as watching paint dry Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).It's clear there are almost too many people to keep track of in 'Ragnarok,' although it doesn't feel as overwhelming as an 'Avengers' film. Perhaps one aspect that helps in this regard is that the main settings of Asgard and Sakaar are interesting. It's nice to see the majority of a Marvel film take place somewhere other than earth, which seems to be a new trend for Marvel. And then there's the soundtrack - a mix of 80s-infused electronica - which doesn't really fit the story, but still sounds pretty cool. Perhaps its weakest element is in the dialogue - too many cheesy jokes thrown in to the point where it almost sounds like a running gag reel.It wouldn't be fair to say 'Thor: Ragnarok' is one of the best Marvel films, but what it lacks in sophistication is made up in the entertainment department."

Thor turned out to be funnier than I was expecting, had enough action to keep me entertained. I am too lazy to rank all the marvel movies out there but this one is nearer the top of the list for me.

22 November 2017,razvan-66077,4,7,2,It's not like in the trailer...,"I really think that this was one of the worst years for Marvel. First Guardians of the Galaxy 2, then Spider Man Homecoming and now Thor:Ragnarok. The movie is enjoyable and has some good laughs. And I think that it's somehow better that the other two movies. However, the trailer looked like this movie will be epic. It was far from that. The plot was underdeveloped and it just doesn't justify the need for this movie, at least for me. It's like they run out of ideas, the story is just so weak...there's really nothing special to it. And you just can't take it seriously because there are too many jokes.Some of them are funny, but some aren't at all or are out of context. For example, at one point, there's this rock golem creature, that it's not from earth,that makes a joke for rock, paper, scissors. How the hell would he know that? You never fear that something bad might happen to a main character, you know for sure that it will end well for them. Also, Loki was a real threat in the previous movies. Now, it just seemed too friendly with everyone. It's like he was a totally different person. And that brings me to one of the worst aspects of this movie...Hera. It is another Marvel villain that could have been incredible. Instead, it has so much power but for nothing...She is just boring because you sense no threat coming from her. So yes, the trailer was way too good for this movie. I had high expectations but I was so disappointed. I think that this movie doesn't bring something new to the Marvel universe, and without it there wouldn't be much difference."

5 November 2017,lasttimeisaw,2,7,7,"THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters","Entrusted in the hands of Kiwi wiz Taika Waititi, the third installment of Marvel's Norse god substantially alters its predecessors' Shakespearean solemnity while rings small changes in the cookie-cutter plot. Right out of the box, Thor (Hemsworth) appears to be modulated in an unusually verbose mood when confronting the fire demon Surur, a scourge of Asgard, who threats to bring Ragnarok (a prophesy of doom of most Norse heroes) to the empyrean planet, only becomes a mere bagatelle under Thor's mighty, that is the tonal-setting prologue, levity and spectacle are the two sides of a helluva galactic ride. The real danger is within the family, an exiled and soon-to-perish Odin (Hopkins) apprises his two sons that his first-born, the ambitious Hela (Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who has been sealed in the prison by him, will be back to reclaim her birthright and play havoc with whoever stands in her way (including the loyal Warriors Three, all dispatched offhandedly en passant). Defeated by Hela, Thor and Loki (Hiddleston) are stranded in the planet Sakaar, literally a huge garbage dumping ground (a smart sideswipe of earth's unsustainable consumerism, mark my words, this is something humans definitely will do when galactic travel will become handy), and its potentate, Grandmaster (a gleefully snide Goldblum) has an archaic hobbyhorse, gladiator fighting, which sets Thor against his ""friend from work"" the Hulk/Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), also explains their conspicuous absence in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016). Soon the trio escapes with a bibulous huntress Valkyrie (Thompson), together they must defend the unvanquished Hela and her resurrected army, so if Ragnarok is preordained, might as well leaving Hela with the calamity, as long as they can take a throng of token survivors and play up the humanistic stopgap, however feeble is might look because you just cannot equate an entire planet with (at most) several hundreds lives. The final victory is hardly a mood-booster, that is why this fiber of discrepancy (playfulness and grave loss) takes its toll in the end. A trendy haircut does do justice to Hemsworth's buff appeal and apparently his comedy timing (apart from showing off his immaculate bod) and it looks like that Loki and Heimdall (Elba) are next in line for a coiffure upgrade; we cannot get enough of Cate Blanchett snarling and blustering in a sleek suit with lissome martial arts postures, her Hela is unapologetic-ally lethal, but some subtlety would have been nice considering her immense craft. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie is the latest addition of Marvel's (not too prescient) recruitment of female superheroes and she is ass-kicking and can equally stand her ground and hold her liquor. Waititi's revamp is a welcome step-up for the ever-expanding comic cinematic universe in toto, its varicolored brio, astute sonic placement, astonishing visual swagger and bristling action verve are exactly what gratify and appeal to its core audience, there is something idiosyncratic lurking beneath a mainstream blockbuster, a baby-step maybe, at least THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters, isn't it?"
23 November 2017,smithcaleb-90386,7,12,2,Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Hemsworth as Star Lord,"It's an enjoyable movie if you look at it as another interpretation of Guardians. I don't understand Marvel. Not every movie has to be funny and not every movie needs to use the same humor. The original Thor had hilarious moments because of his social awkwardness. This is not a Thor movie. None of the characters play as themselves. Bruce Banner is unrecognizable and Loki seems to be more of Rocket than he is Loki. Marvel needs to get it together. I'm sick of seeing the same movie every time I see that red logo pop up. I went to see a THOR movie, not another GOTG film. A more comedic Thor film could have been done. This is proof of the laziness of Marvel now. Terrible Thor film and marginally okay Guardians film."
3 October 2019,cherold,3,13,8,best and funniest of the Thor movies,"With a breezy sense of humor and some great action scenes, Ragnarok is easily the best of the Thor movies, closer in its silly spirit to Guardians of the Galaxy than to the underwhelming first entry.The new characters introduced are excellent, especially Jeff Goldblum as a sleazy, genial dictator and Tessa Tompson as a hard-drinking bounty hunter who deserves her own movie. And the film's director is hilarious as a motion-captured boulder-man.The story is engaging and the director keeps things moving at a brisk pace. The Thor subfranchise has definitely upped its game."
12 November 2017,subxerogravity,3,12,9,RagnaROKS!,"Ragnarok is a fun movie with a lot of cool stylized actions scenes. It's never boring, but it is very different in tone than the two previous films, thanks mostly to director Taika Waititi. I recognize his style of humor in movies like Boy and What we Do in Shadows, which he also directed. It's really enjoyable, and the light tone helps for it to be entertaining. Although if you are following the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially if you have seen the other two Thor movies, The whole purpose of Ragnarok is for Thor to stop his sister, the God of Death (played by Cate Blachett) form ending Asgard, and there are a lot of parts of the movie that I did feel should have been more serious but were disregarded for the lighter tone, but I must admit this is a minor flaw in a movie that was just so amazing. It's like when film critics say, it's a thrill ride, they are totally talking about blockbusters like Thor: Ragnarok. It's a big adventure with a lot of things going on, done in this 80s Sci-fi and Fantasy style. Chris Hemsworth was everything as Thor: an action hero, charming, dramatic, just perfect star power, and Tom Hiddleson once again kills it as his brother Loki, who takes more of a heroes journey having to help his brother save all the Realms form their newly discovered older sister Hella, the goddess of Death, played by Blachett, who does not normally do movies like this and after seeing her play a great marvel villain here, I hope she'll decide to do more. The cinematic Universe's first female villain (or rather lead antagonist), Blachett does beautiful and deadly all at the same time. She looked sooooo good in that costume, and she brought the right type of evil. It's a shame she did not get more screen time (Feel like it had something to do with the fact that she was a woman), but Blachett's time as a villain had to be shared with the other antagonist in the film, The Grnadmaster, played by the great Jeff Goldblum who also gave a stellar performance as a cosmic being who runs the contest of champions Thor ends up being force to participate in where he meets his old Avengers buddy, the Hulk (Making up for the fact that he was not in Captain America: Civil War). The movie also features Tessa Thompson who plays Valkyrie, and gave some pretty cool fight scenes. Ragnarok is a huge story almost like a Star Wars film, it's got everything, and does everything and the humorous undertone does make it work better (Though I think I still prefer Empire Strikes back over return of the Jedi) Ragnarok: rocks!http://cinemagardens.com"

20 March 2019,williampsamuel,2,5,9,Ragnarok is Ludicrously Awesome Entertainment,"With a title like Ragnarok you have certain expectations. You expect apocalyptic combat against hordes of demons and undead, a giant wolf, a colossal serpent, and the end of the world. You don't expect a light hearted, tongue in cheek comedy. You certainly don't expect Willy Wonka references. Saying Marvel has taken an unconventional approach with this story would be putting it lightly, but the results are pure awesomeness.For a movie about the goddess of death and the destruction of Asgard, Ragnarok spends a lot of time off planet. Hela's depredations in Asgard are relegated to the background for most of the middle act after Thor and Loki are accidentally teleported to an alien world. Not that that's a problem in the least. Lots of awesome things go down on the Sakaar, including a reunion with a certain green skinned Avenger. After various misadventures the heroes do eventually get back to Asgard, where the real battle begins.And oh, are the battles grand. The Thor-Hulk fight is every bit as awesome as it looks in the trailers. There's also an excellent dogfight in the skies of Sakaar. But the final climactic battle against Hela and her minions beats everything else, hands down. It sprawling, chaotic, and ultimately apocalyptic in its intensity. This is one place where they might have made the tone just a bit grimmer and more desperate. But there's no denying the awesomeness when Thor really brings the thunder. And the death scene (I won't reveal whose) is the very definition of badass.What really sets Ragnarok apart though is its sense of humor. It may not be side splitting in the way that Guardians was, but in every situation the movie finds humor in the awkwardness, improbability, or sheer absurdity of the moment. There's good slapstick, puns and innuendos, subtle and not so subtle references, and some excellent fish out of water bits with Hulk's alter ego Banner.. Even the fight scenes are played for laughs. But none of it would work without the actors and the wonderful characters they play.Tom Hiddleston continues to shine as Loki. Not exactly a villain anymore, but far from heroic, he's still scheming, manipulative, vain, a bit cowardly, and oh so quick to betray his brother or anyone else if there's something to be gained from it. He also takes it surprisingly well when his plans are foiled over, and over, and over again. And of course he ultimately helps save the day, in his own arrogant and shameless way. It's kind of weird seeing one of Marvel's most powerful villains become a comedic foil and sidekick, but darned if it doesn't work.Jeff Goldblum is absolutely priceless as the megalomaniacal Grandmaster. In the comics, the Grandmaster of the Universe is near omnipotent and old as the universe itself, with motives and designs that humans can barely begin to comprehend. But here Goldblum plays him as the ultimate hedonist and egomaniac. Like a toned down, laid back Emperor Nero he presides over endless parties and gladiatorial games, disposes of those who get in his way, and even fronts his own synth pop band. Yet he's just so mild-mannered, outwardly friendly and slightly befuddled that it's impossible to hate him. Only Goldblum could make this work, and does he ever.Kate Blanchet also makes a very strong impression as Hela, exuding a sense of menace and lethal power in every scene. But perhaps the most interesting new character is the Valkyrie. Once a proud Asgardian warrior, she's now an alcoholic mercenary and slaver, working for the highest bidder and willing to sell out her own king. She's fierce, sassy, hot tempered, and absolutely deadly. Definitely not the type you bring home to mom. Even when she allies with Thor she loses none of the attitude. I really hope we see more of her in the coming films.All in all, Thor: Ragnarok is another resounding success for Marvel. It's action packed, well-acted, hilarious, and even has some surprising twists. It isn't what you'd expect from the title, but it's so much better."
4 November 2017,bkrauser-81-311064,1,2,8,Very Much On Point!,"At the risk of sounding repetitive, the newest installation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Ragnarok is just as solid as the rest. Solid to the point where I actually feel a little uncomfortable cheerleading for what is, at its heart by now, a cash cow for Disney, Executive Producer Kevin Feige and whatever dark syndicate pulling the strings of Marvel's media empire (my money's on Bohemian Grove). Fact remains, the mouse-eared imagineers of the MCU know how to give their audience what they want and unlike their competitors, they keep most of the focus on story ensuring we keep coming back for more.Thor: Ragnarok begins with our hero Thor (Hemsworth) on the cusp of discovering the portents of a potentially world-ending prophecy. The film then shuttles us off to Thor's home of Asgard, then Earth, before the arrival of our all-powerful villain Hela (Blanchett) forces Thor into exile on the planet of Sakaar. Thor is then taken prisoner and forced to fight as a gladiator for the peculiar Grandmaster (Goldblum) whose coliseum ensures his rule over the fledgling, polluted planet.From there, Thor: Ragarok descends into an eccentric, playful version of Mad Max: Thunderdome (1985) mixed with Flash Gordon (1980), with only a tinge of the original sword-and-sorcery pomposity that made Dark World (2013) nearly unbearable. The stakes are just as grave this time around – fate of the world, galaxy, what have you, still rests on the shoulders of the brash Thor and to a lesser extent, Loki (Hiddleston), Hulk (Ruffalo) and series newcomer Scrapper 142 (Thompson). But here the Thor series is given an adrenaline boost and a funny bone which, while that doesn't silence the criticism of undue bathos, does feed well into director Taika Waititi's unique sensibilities.For what it's worth, Ragnarok, in addition to being a perfect example of franchise maintenance done right, comes equipped with a fun-loving, self-effacing Waititi spin; which yes, does include a minor but meaty role for Maori character actress Rachel House. The New Zealand director has been one of my contemporary favorites ever since coming across What We Do in the Shadows (2014) by sheer accident. It is said that to get the job, Waititi developed a sizzle reel to define the film's tone complete with reoccurring gags and clips of, of all things Big Trouble in Little China (1986). That reel also included Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" which fits Thor about as well as Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" fits you know who. Now if only we can get a King Crimson song associated with Doctor Strange instead of that obnoxious sitar lick, then we'd really be cooking.The film wisely answers criticisms that the events of the MCU ultimately mean little, by giving the audience glimpses of the overall franchise's larger machinations. This proves a double-edged sword. Being given small pieces of the franchise's endgame does work to keep the audience invested. But those living under a rock for the last decade will probably only get the ""gist"" of the plot and be confused through most of it. Prior knowledge is pretty much necessary at this point.Is that really a negative? Of course not; if you're coming into Ragnarok with a clean slate and walking out before the credits end than at this point it's your own damn fault. What is a negative is just how unwieldy this entire exercise in extended universe building has all become. To get to the second act, the film rushes through an Asgardian lifetime of familial resentments and prophecy kicked off and juxtaposed by comparatively pallid moments for Odin (Hopkins), Heimdall (Elba) and the Warriors Three (Asano, Stevenson & Levi). Natalie Portman is also absent from this film, which wouldn't have really mattered if the film didn't feel the need to explain it with a quick patch-job. By the time we get to the second act, none of the stakes have sunk in yet and the only strong impression you get is that of Cate Blanchett vamping about in a black leather leotard. That and the, by now, tired back and forth between Thor and Loki.Thankfully that second and third act hits the nail on the head thanks to the aforementioned Blanchett and especially Goldblum who seems to be having all sorts of fun as a composite of Ming the Merciless and a second-tier lounge hall comedian. Mark Ruffalo is also given a chance to actually act the part of Hulk which I must once again say I'm still no onboard with Ruffalo's nebbish portrayal, but whatever. The surprise here is Tessa Thompson who puts a spirited and spiteful spin on the fallen antihero in need of redemption trope. One can't help but think that if she was given just a tad more to do, she'd be able to plug the hole of every critic complaining about the lack of feminine representation in Marvel films.All in all, Ragnarok is a real treat of a movie. It tells a busy, unwieldy story with humor and insight all while hinting at bigger and badder things to come. The acting, directing, production design and special-effects are, as always, superb and the script does a tremendous job holding the larger universe from scattering into a million pieces like a spent Mjolnir. The Gods (and/or The Grove) have shown favor to this latest installment of the MCU. Here's to hoping for more installments just like it in quality."
8 November 2017,happychrisy101,12,23,10,Thor: Ragnorok - the freshest and the best-est,"Easily the best MCU film to date. Taika Waititi has worked his magic once again and managed to make something that is entirely fresher, funner, and fantastic-er. The characters are rounded and seem so much more real than in previous MCU films where they can all seem a bit stiff. Every character is a stand out and the story is engaging without being too complex. An absolute CORKER of a film!"
18 March 2018,stuartmenziesfarrant-159-538079,5,7,1,"Nope...Wasted opportunity, wasted budget.","Yet another movie franchise dummed down to its bare non-essentials. Go see it if you are a teenager and unaware of the Marvel Comics universe. Sophomoric, banal and ridiculuously stapled to the whole fakery of political correctness and social engineering madness.Too much comedy crammed in ( I guess its the Disney effect ) which lessens the Characters and story.
Take away the Hulk v Thor fight and there's not much left.
Honestly only one fight in the gladiator arena is not enough.AWFUL!! cheesy, dumb, and desperately trying to get in on the success of guardians of the galaxy. This doesn't feel like any of the previous Avenger related films, and what they did to Hulk is shameful. One of the worst films i have ever watched. That being said, if you like GotG, and GotG2 then you'll probably appreciate the humor in this more than i did.What the hell happened? It's like Thor meets Monty Python on one of their off days. Risible humour. Loki has definitely put on weight. Odin in a care home. I will be turning this off any time soon. Hopefully Cate Blanchett will infect some life into this mess of a movie. Oops Cate is as camp as Christmas like a taller version of Wednesday Adams. Marvel is dead in the water. Where is the off switch?"
27 October 2017,Nixon_Carmichael,7,23,6,"Sure. I guess it's fine. It's not high art, but it's a funny brainless comedy.","Yes, Thor Ragnorak is a comedy first and action movie second. It's weird because it's a movie about of an end of a world, and Marvel turns it into a cartoon. Perhaps that's not a bad thing, but it's not my cup of tea personally, typically. Thor Ragnorak works in the sense that everyone does a pretty good job in the acting department, we've got Cate Blanchett for Christ's sake. If I have a problem with this movie, it's that like most Marvel proper movies before it, it's a cartoon. This is a movie for 14 year old kids, and that's OK, but it's not a thinking man's movie.The other problem is that suddenly cgi Hulk can carry on with coherent conversations, with no real explanation. I guess this where we are at this point."
15 June 2018,jamesrupert2014,2,7,8,Tongue-in-cheek Ragnoruckus,"Taking a page from the popular ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is played strictly for laughs. I initially disliked the constant stream of wisecracks and sight-gags, but after a while got into the spirt of the film and for the most part enjoyed it. Once again, the hero has to deal with a malevolent God (in this case, Thor's sister Hela), which after a few diversions to pick up the supporting cast, leads to a climatic CGI-spectacular showdown. Chris Hemsworth seems to have fun playing the flippant (and sometime petulant) God of Thunder, as does Cate Blanchett, who plays his wicked sister, the be-antlered Goddess of Death Hela, and Tom Hiddleston, back for the fourth round as duplicitous brother Loki. The special effects, if not particularly novel or imaginative, are excellently rendered and the supporting cast (humans and otherwise) entertaining. The score includes Led Zeppelin's iconic ""Immigrant Song"", which adds a real kick to the battles. The 'plot' is some vague revision of the ""Ragnarok"" legend (in which Asgard is overcome and the Gods (including Thor) destroyed), and a few players from that story make appearances (e.g. The Fenris Wolf, The Midgard Serpent, Surtr), but it's all just an excuse for a massive, but largely bloodless, battle between Thor and his motley crew of supporters and his sister's army of demonic cannon-fodder. In keeping with modern sensibilities, the Asgardians are a somewhat more diverse looking group than one might expect in the home of Norse Gods and Tessa Thompson makes (IMO) an unlikely Valkyrie. Silly but fun."

Taika Waititi is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today and it is great to see a major studio allow such a unique voice to make the exact film that they wanted to without sacrificing their creativity. This is not only one of the best Marvel films but one of the best straight comedies of the decade. I cannot wait to see what Waititi has in store in the future.
4 May 2019,MikeVagan,3,7,8,Thunder against dirt,"All known category of films marvel - THOR, this time did not disappoint with his story. However, the technical part of the film, for me personally, a little disappointed.The background, which clearly stood in the pavilions was a little unfinished. And it was evident early in the film- some fuzzy details. Again, as always, humor graced the film. Very interesting remarks.
With regards to scenes with character-warlock, incomplete effects pushed very hard on the eyes, because periodically the picture of the characters has shifted so that someone just out of frame.
All in the same the early the Director us gives to know about new characters and about their characteristics. Perhaps, this was suddenly. Brevity is the sister of talent.Sometimes, there were references to the following films. This is with regards to decorations. An interesting technique that asks a lot of questions...and one of them:
""Why was this done?""The technical side of film was disappointing and in the middle of the movie. Not very good computer effects in dark scenes, BUT that doesn't make the movie terrible or less interesting."

28 April 2019,jere_zabala,4,14,10,"Masterpiece, what the GODFATHER should have been but it never was.","A film that only smart people will get it, this film is one of the best films of Marvel, MILLIONS times better than THE WINTER SOLDIER, which I ranked it with a 1/10 in this site, cause it has hundreds of flaws without saying the plot has already been done thousands of times before and it's SO BORING, but coming back to THOR RAGNAROK, it has a perfect script, perfect humor, actually, it's the only marvel movie that has a natural humor, the other ones are too forced, but this one is perfection in all ways."
21 February 2018,Semisonic,2,5,7,"Absolutely ridiculous, yet the best possible outcome","I don't know whether the comic book Thor is or has ever been popular, but its movie adaptation never stood much chance. It's simply impossible to make good cinema - which implies evolution and improvement - when your main theme revolves around almighty and technically unkillable gods which seem to be perfect by design. The first movie had the bonus of setting's and characters' freshness, but the sequel was basically a mess simply because the franchise hit the ceiling and started to suffocate.What Ragnarok did to Thor is both a blasphemy and a revival. The almighty ones are still mighty enough for the show, but aren't quite omnipotent anymore. More to that, this movie has much less hero'ing and much, MUCH more goofiness. Director Taika Waititi basically splits it in two: the ""typical Thor"" stuff, with Asgardian theme, a serious villain and ""true"" confrontation, and the ""comic relief"" part which, from its neon disco start, was obvious to bear nothing but the ironic load - and that irony is exactly what makes Thor Ragnarok not merely watchable (which Dark World failed at) but even actually funny.The difference between funny and fun is so subtle that some don't see it at all - but there is one and it's important. By breaking the rules and turning a superhero film into a sequence of ""Thor and Loki walk into a bar""-like sketches, Ragnarok loses a clear point of view we could perceive it from. Should we still expect it to be coherent and consistent within its own rules? Or should we just let ourselves slide along the slapstick action because nothing is truly serious or important anymore? The film tries to cater to every side of this argument, but kinda ends sitting straight in between of two chairs, with no obvious failure but with a typical crack implying that its pants might've fallen a victim of the bold maneuver.Call me old-fashioned and rigid, but, despite all the funny quirks, this film feels more like a filler intro for the upcoming Infinity Wars epic where Thor will probably make sense again. If we accept such purpose as worthy though, Ragnarok isn't bad at all. Had it taken any other road, and we would've ended with another dark and tedious drag filled with mumbo jumbo and long fighting scenes with gloomy faces. Luckily for us, the faces here are far from that (maybe far enough to call them goldblum'y), so let's learn to enjoy the little things and have fun while they still serve it, shall we?"

So that, many good plots suffer of this bad habit. The reason is simple: no respect for the viewer, just profit. The solution is to divide the movie in episodes as the comics do. However hollywoodian CEOs are too dumb to understand this solution, in order to avoid to scam viewers with the misrepresentation of good plots reduced in a mediocrity way. The other solution is to make extended releases of the movies via blu-ray, and or an extended releases for the cinemas."

5 November 2017,deus35,10,19,10,"Thor, God of Thunder, receives thundering laughter's all the way through!","Being a long time marvel comic fan, I was a bit disappointed with Thor 1 and 2. Going to the movies, I had no high expectation, aside from seeing the high score on IMDb at that point, with 8.3 at 23k votes. I simply wanted to see the movie because I wanted to follow all the movies in preparation for the Infinity Wars.To start of, I would like to commend the writers on how they took so many story lines from the comic books and implemented them so well in small and modified parts into the movie. Lets be real, Planet Hulk, Ragnarok, Hela, and other story lines from the comics which I will not mention due to spoilers, could not be brought to full life even if the movie had spanned for 3 hours (note:movie played for 130 minutes).However they were intelligently crafted into the story line in small parts with a awesome dose of comedy that could even challenge Deadpool (whom for me is by far still the best Marvel movie with the best comedic parts, though Thor Ragnarok is a close contender).Then there is the mood and music set on the alien planet Thor and Hulk are on. The 80's synth music, the very light touch of Bladerunner (very light and is there in my opinion!), and the great banter between Hulk/Banner and Thor was simply amazing. That was writing and comedy at its best! The fight scenes were not disappointing either, a bit blurry at times, but all in all well done and a great display of higher level powers that match a bit more with the power levels set in Marvel comics, so that was awesome! All in all, you will not be disappointed! I personally thought Thor 1 and 2 were mediocre, however this one was truly done so right, I wish I could promote it more in anyway so more people would go and see it! Hope this helps you make the correct decision to take friends,family and kids and go see it in the cinemas! Enjoy!"
14 January 2019,IronManu77,3,7,10,Hollywood at its best...Thor Ragnarok is a masterpiece!,"New characters in Thor Ragnarok.....Surtur, Rockman, Mik, Hela, Grandmaster, Valkyrie, Skurge.....Personally, this movie has great rewatching value. It is not as serious as the first two Thor movies and so the change of tactics by adding humor is really well refined. We have plenty of blu rays to enjoy at home but this is our go to movie to feel good. My wife, son and myself particularly love all the characters and the story that unfolds in an entertaining manner. The women are very beautiful, especially Hela and Valkyrie. Hela's makeup changes time and again and that is the only drawback, but she makes up for the great character she plays as the Goddess of Death. Loki is at his usual mischievous self but it was good to see Thor and Loki get along and reunite in this third Thor installment. There are plenty of new characters introduced and the technology is amazing and futuristic. The ability to leap from one world to another is incredible and they do it with ease. I highly recommend getting the blu ray version....the sound and picture are fantastic as is the movie.In summary, the main reason why I like this movie is because it shows even the Gods have their share of problems such as jealousy and sibling rivalry. At the end of the day, despite all the fighting and betrayals, brothers will be brothers and must get along. This is a strong message to our mortal world to get along despite all wrong that happens around us. This is an amazing movie about being a hero and overcoming personal strife and helping people in need. That is what heroes do. :)To the actors, developers of the movie and all those who put their hard work into this masterpiece, my heartiest thanks as this is a treasure to keep and cherish forever."

And luckily, its the silliness is intentional.'Thor: Ragnarok' Synopsis: Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela and the impending Ragnarök.'Thor: Ragnarok' works till it lasts, but I have one question: Did the humor have to be on till the point of overkill? Sure, the jokes land well & even energy remains all through in the narrative, but after a point, I laughed only because I had too. Its fun to watch Thor aka The Hammer of God on a light note & being the bum of many a joke, as well as watching HULK being supremely angry, with Bruce Banner being the ever surprised in real-self. But only till a point.Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost's Screenplay goes all-out for the laughs & succeeds. But at the expense of a mediocre villain & a few lagging pieces. The Terrific Taika Waititi Directs this recent Superhero Blockbuster, with the perfect blend of madness & ambition. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume & Graphics, are outstanding.Of the cast, Chris Hemsworth shines as Thor, continuing to play the part with complete commitment. And he's so funny here! Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk, is very good. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, is okay. Cate Blanchett as Hela, is reduced into being a seductive, but one-note villain. And Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster, steals the show. On the whole, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a good time, but nothing more."

The opening sequence is hilarious and nothing is more perfect than badass Thor fighting to Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" to send the movie on it's way. We get a bit of background of Odin, the Valkyries, and Asgard along the way, but the movie's primary focus is preventing Ragnorok.As always, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are flawless in their roles. Cate Blanchett is perfection as the sociopathic Hela and Ruffalo is charming as the bipolar Hulk who really just wants to be loved. Who knew?But what we love most about this movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. Sure it has all the requisite elements of a great superhero movie, but it is funny... REALLY funny.

24 February 2018,perezdaprezident-42189,4,6,8,"If you have never seen a sitcom with a big budget,this is for you!!!","Marvel NAILED Civil War and Winter Soldier,NAILED The Avengers,Nailed Iron Man but at some point i got tired of the rest of the filler movies in between where not much seems to be happening except a villain of the week type antagonist and the hero who has to fight for his life,but it was acceptable.
Now Marvel (or rather Disney) has given up on ANY taught of suspense,gravitas,intensity or consequence in their movies,thus making them what WE,the actual Marvel comic book fans (or just movie fans) were scared it would happen,movies for selling toys and amusing toddlers."
30 July 2018,thomasjay-2201,1,2,8,A joy to watch,"A fantastic marvel film and standalone piece Ragnarok is a massive improvement upon the previous instalments in the 'Thor' universe and is an easy film to watch, light hearted, action packed and vibrant it feels alive and bustling. Granted there is a slight issue with parts which feel a bit of a drag in comparison and Jeff Goldblum's character who feels irrelevant but that aside is thoroughly entertaining"
4 May 2019,zeionara,3,8,7,Ghosts of the past,"Liked this less than it's older brother about dark world, because as for me in comparasion to the latter it is less dense with beautiful events and action overall - I would prefer if more time was dedicated to scenes in Asgard. But the strongest sides of picture are spectacular fighting scenes and set of unique turns of story, which were even more surprising than in previous movie. So, think it should be watched especially in case you don't want to lose an important logical node in Infinity Sage."
9 July 2021,shubhamkr-78657,9,16,10,Most amazing enjoyable and entertaining movie for me. Thanks for giving me such joy marvel.I really needed it,"I love watching marvel movie.Thor child of odin is super fantastic .Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence, giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality.I am also eager to know what will happen when they are going to find out there new home . Marvel Marvel Marvel."
15 November 2017,afsalthodupuzha,2,5,8,The Funniest Superhero Movie Till Date,"Kiwi director Taika Waititi is famed for his awe-inspiring comedy drama's like ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" and ""Boy"" and Marvel's decision to rope him in to direct a sequel to a rather struggling 'Thor' franchise by itself hinted some surprises in store as was concreted by a refreshing,bad-ass theaterical trailer.Breathing a bounty of fresh air into the sinking series,Waititi's hilarious re-invention of Thor is undoubtedly a bold attempt from Marvel who have succeeded in making a thoroughly enjoyable superhero comedy that never lets you down for a moment in its runtime of around 130 minutes.The storyline traverses through unpredictable paths that are outrageously wild and funny with quirky one-liners and dedicated performances from everyone in the cast.A terrific background score by Mark Mothersbaugh deserves a special mention for the imperative part that it has played in raising the adrenaline rush particularly during action sequences.Chris Hemsworth excelled with his incredible comic-timing and rendered his career- best performance.Mark Ruffle and Tom Hiddleston gave impressive acts as Hulk and Loki respectively.Another character that stole attention was taht of Korg,the instantly lovable rock monster made lively by the peculiar voice of Waititi himself.The mid and post credit scenes introduces us to upcoming MCU adventure ""Avengers: Infinity War"" that looks promising just the way Ragnarok is.Overall,with an impeccable sense of humor, exhilarating musical score,stunning action blocks and impressive lead performances this sequel to The Dark world can be counted among the best films ever from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.A must watch affair in all means!"
20 April 2019,Lost_In_Translation_,4,13,9,THEY MADE THOR GOOD!,"When the original Thor came out, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was at the start of the MCU and it was an entertaining watch.With the vast improvements in storytelling, action, and character development the MCU has seen, re-watching Thor 1 has been a bit of a tough one to go back to. It's still decent, but it's really brought down by the Earth side characters (Natalie Portman and the annoying intern), and some really lackluster action direction (fighting the destroyer at the end).When Thor 2 came out, I enjoyed it at first, but soon came to realize that it was not very good. It has moments, but it's villain was AWFUL, the side Earth characters were even more goddamn annoying, and the story was just so unmemorable that I can barely remember what it was about...So when Thor 3 rolled around, I was skeptical. Iron Man recovered after the awful 2, Captain America got progressively better each movie, and I crossed my fingers that Thor would do the same. And luckily for all MCU fans, it did!It was a fantastic idea for them to team up Thor and Hulk as we've seen now that Hulk in his own movie really doesn't work well. Some people are critical of the comedy they added, while there are moments where it is too much, it works pretty well for the most part.This is the exact boost that Thor needed. I'm sure if you asked ANY MCU fan before this movie if they liked Thor and most people would give you a ""MEH"" reaction. But ask them after this movie? I'm sure many would tell you that he's their new favorite.One of the aspects that really improves it was removing all of the Earth side characters from the first movies. Removing the forced love interest and the annoying intern were the best things to ever happen to Thor. It's something I was hoping for with the 2nd movie, but they really felt the need to add ""relatable"" characters and keep bringing Thor back to Earth. Earth is only seen for a moment in this one, but 98% of the movie is on alien planets. Something I think Marvel was weary on doing until Guardians of the Galaxy ended up being a smash hit.I'm so happy with how Ragnarok turned out. It's just so damn fun to watch. Some of the humor is a bit too much, but most of it works and really make Thor a much more fun character to watch. Thor might be the ONLY original Avenger to get a 4th solo movie, and with this rejuvenated style of Thor I'm actually excited to see more from it. Not knowing what the finale of Endgame will hold, it might be cool to have him team up with another hero for an adventure, or possibly the return of Sif?"
4 February 2021,bingemaster3000,7,16,10,The Strongest Avenger Movie,Seriously the best Avenger movie in the Marvel Universe. The writing was clever. The action was awesome. The characters were ingenious.

17 April 2019,zuzanahornakova07,9,16,2,Destroyed my HERO!,"I was super sad when I saw this film. They just forsed the humor and made a comedian out of a Asgardian God. 😩 Really disappointed, they have ruined my hero..."
3 November 2017,leegato,3,7,5,UPDATE: A Taika Waititi Film with Thor Characters Slapped On,"Thor: Ragnarok continues Thor's journey since he left in search of the Infinity Stones at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. When a new enemy arrives that threatens Asgard from Ragnarok, the foretold mythological end of everything, Thor must battle his way to save his home.Ultimately, Thor: Ragnarok is an entertaining rock concert of a film, adopting a Guardians of the Galaxy aesthetic, in terms of visuals and humor, but very much keeping it a part of the Thor franchise motif. Its use of an energetic soundtrack, humorous dialogue, and well-directed action sequences makes it an archetypal Marvel film.This movie is saturated with humor. Whether it's Marvel's funniest film is debatable, and whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. But the film banks on humor; there are laugh out loud moments almost every 20 minutes in the film. At times it manages to find its perfect pacing for particular scenes to characterize Thor and the supporting cast, but at other times the humor seems to play as a huge distractor to mask its otherwise basic plot.Don't get me wrong, the plot is fine. No spoilers; Feige was right to say that Ragnarok, indeed, sets up many story elements and important character developments for Infinity War, but it seems to only do the bare minimum with the plot. The key plot points in Ragnarok are presented with a more lighthearted pace, which seems to take away from their impact on the greater MCU. The story's enough to keep Thor's solo adventure going and set things up for the future, but the writing is so focused on creating humorous exchanges and buddy-cop character relationships that it falls short on actually characterizing the supporting characters and villains in a deep way and writing a more clever plot. The plot is just ""good enough.""Aesthetically, Thor: Ragnarok is the most visually stunning Thor film to date. Waititi took great care in crafting his shots and cinematography, which helped immerse his audience into the distinguishable worlds encountered in this film. Props also to the direction of the action sequences, which seemed to capture more of Thor's comic book style than his previous appearances have ever shown.With what she was given, Cate Blanchett does an excellent job as Hela and grounds the film with a formidable and intimidating villain. Tessa Thompson was great as Valkyrie and sets up the character for future films as a powerful Asgardian who arguably surpasses Thor. Jeff Goldblum also brought the Grandmaster's quirkiness and wit to life, playing it with the perfect blend of ""villainy"" and humor.Go see Thor: Ragnarok if you want to have a fun time in the theater filled with your favorite characters, laughs, and stunning visuals, but don't expect an intricate story presented to you in an intricate format; just expect a film that manages follow the Marvel formula with exactly the right amount of ingredients. Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is a movie that aims to be more funny than thoughtful, and falls short on what could have been a potentially better story as a result.UPDATE: I'm updating my review to account for how this film had way too much comedy in it. In retrospect, I felt the film played off way too many potentially serious and dramatic moments in the film that could have developed characters more into cheap laughs. It certainly creates the illusion that it's more entertaining because of the laughs it delivers, but it compromises its ability to be compelling and tell a decent story. The plot has several crucial moments that has grand repercussions not only for the world of Thor, but also for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. Thor: Ragnarok could have been really compelling, but Waititi decided to make a buddy-cop comedy film with minimal character development for its supporting cast, retracting the film from any emotion or heart in its crucial moments that can invest its audience in what should have been a thrilling story in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is tonally imbalanced to be funny all the way through, with no serious or dramatic moments to balance out the comedy; even the more serious moments have laughs in them! I'm now lowering my rating to a 5/10."
19 March 2018,zubairali-23064,5,9,2,This shouldn't be a comedy,"I was so disappointed watching this movie , I am a die hard marvel fan and this has to be one of the worst marvel movies I've seen, Thor dark world was serious and dark loved it, and the humour in this ruined it, will they have the same humour in infinite wars doubt it so why ruin this film so disappointed!"

1 June 2019,silvianosophia,11,21,2,Another kiddyfied Marvel slapstick sequel,"What is with the Hollywood/Disney lately? They take decent adult movies and make sequels for children. They ruined Star Wars, now they ruin Thor, etc.Unless you are a child, avoid the sequel and watch something good, you will enjoy that much more."
19 February 2019,censorme,2,3,8,Fun fun funny,Hemsworth delivers some great comedic timing with a great cast. I loved the Kiwi sounding character. He was hilarious!! A must watch
16 March 2018,ThyDavideth,1,2,6,Why Doth Chicken Crosseth Thy Roadeth?,"Thor is now a comedian. Hulk can carry a conversation which makes him look even more autistic. Plus we get that see his naked green @$$. Loki is a hero...... Well, it is sort of an improvement, I guess, considering Thor was always a retard with his Shakespearean dialogue and his dumb @$$ hammer. But unfortunately I have a disdain for anything that betrays the original source like what happened with Spider Man Homecoming so **** this $#!+ and its comedic tone is at times annoying. I did somewhat enjoy this movie for its action and, well, that's about it. Hope Marvel becomes a big time failure in future."
5 August 2018,km_staple,2,4,10,Loved it!,"I absolutely love the humor in the Avengers movies and this one didn't disappoint. Love the unnamed guest star playing Loki in the ""play"". If you enjoy the Marvel Avengers movies, you will love it."
7 November 2019,LoganWright1,2,3,8,Don't know what happened with this one,"Marvel films are known for sneaking humor in between action sequences, but I don't know what they did with this one. The choreography was lame and I don't understand why Thor felt like he was trying too hard to be funny."
5 June 2019,evanston_dad,2,11,7,At Least It's Funny,"I think I saw the first ""Thor"" movie. All of these superhero movies blend together in my mind. I know I missed some of them, because there was clearly plot exposition that probably would have made ""Thor: Ragnarok"" make more sense. Oh well, these movies don't make much sense even if you have seen them all. They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they're over and hope you'll be so dazzled that you'll forget any crappy parts. It's harder and harder for me to watch movies like this and get past the weapon fetishism they all wallow in -- there's such an emphasis on how cool you look wielding your big gun, the bigger the better. In the increasingly disturbing American gun culture, it's no longer possible (for me at least) to shrug stuff like this off as ""only a movie."" But whatever...I acknowledge that I probably shouldn't be watching movies like this in the first place if that's going to bother me.As for the rest? It's pretty funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's got Cate Blanchett looking sexy as hell in a dominatrix outfit (that is, until she puts on a ridiculous hat that makes her look like one of Satan's reindeer). I got tired of it, but as you might have gathered if you've stayed with this review, I'm probably not the target audience for it.Grade: B"
27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,1,3,6,"Thor: Ragnarok is the third entry in the God of Thunder's series, and is a fresh reinvention of the character.","Hollywood, listen to me. Give Taika Waititi massive budgets because it's clear he makes films fun. Marvel continues their trend of making light hearted comic book adaptations, but at a cost that too many people are overlooking. In this chapter, Thor returns to Asgard but the city is threatened by an old legendary villain: Hela, the Goddess of Death. Thrown out of the Bifrost, he must team up with old and new allies to prevent Ragnarok from occurring. It's another overstuffed chapter filled with Easter Eggs, returning characters and much promise for future entries (specifically Infinity War). The surprising alteration was Marvel's fresh reinvention of Thor and the remaining characters. The extremely witty and humorous script assists in bringing the characters to life, more so than before. The banter is hilarious, extremely energetic performances and far more self aware than any other MCU entry. Despite all of this, I feel it's far too late to reinvent these characters. Thor is suddenly a comedic genius and knows far too much about Earth (including it's colourful English language...). Heimdall doesn't feel like his past iteration at all. Completely different. Personally, I like consistency. In a bid to make a visual delight full of bright contrasting colours like Guardians of the Galaxy, it unfortunately feels like Marvel had abandoned the previous Thor films and the darker and richer style they had. We all know these blockbusters have good performances. The action set pieces are entertaining as always. Waititi's direction is a welcome addition. I just feel, dare I say, underwhelmed by superhero films these days. The human CGI was a let down, Hela was underdeveloped and it all wrapped up too quickly with no impact! It sounds like I'm being harsh for the sake of it, I'm not. I honestly enjoyed this and it felt like a comic book movie. I just find the drastic change in tone contradicts and negates previous chapters. Led Zeppelin though, no complaints there."
29 January 2018,izaaklodge,8,13,4,Bait and switch,"Sad how Portman was removed, just added to the cheap lets make one in Australia feel. The kiwi rock man was a plus. The Valkyrie was stupid with op powers and didnt fit. Kate, my god, could they have found a more boring vanilla private school teacher with all the curves of a 14 year old boy.

6 November 2019,shawnsmithfd,1,1,7,Oh well,Too bad. I loved the first two Thor movies and was expecting that the third one will hold up to the quality of the first two.

22 January 2018,wutang-30319,7,11,3,"Wow, just wow.","I don't know how people are giving this movie a 10/10, I really don't. I completely understand that art is subjective but this is sad. This movie is overflowing with jokes, normally in a comedy movie this would be normal, but this is a super hero film with dire consequences which seem to go ignored for most of the movie. The story was barely there to the point where even the characters didn't notice it. But don't worry jokes are always around the corner. Very important character dies, 30 seconds later... jokes. Losing a very important weapon, 30 seconds later.... jokes. Home is getting destroyed while the people get killed, 30 seconds later.... jokes. No event carries any weight, everything gets shrugged off with lame low hanging jokes. I don't mind comedy mixed in with super hero movies, I love Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man, but this was just bad. I seriously thought in the beginning that this was a Thor parody, because it plays like one. Bad jokes, breaking character for a laugh, odd cameos, and scenes that are on par with any low budget film. The acting suffered from this plot free for all frequently. No reason to try I guess, say the lines and go home. I really wonder who put less work in between the actors and the writers, any awards or praise should be given to the CGI team. They created a beautiful world and great effects, unfortunately that alone doesn't make a good movie. The villain of this movie offered no sanctuary from the mediocrity, she was a cookie cutter villain with a plan to destroy and rule and.... that's pretty much it. Nothing philosophical here, just plain old kill and rule everything, for what? Who knows. But don't worry because I know killing sounds serious, but luckily she will joke around the whole time. The lack of urgency and care about what is going on shows on the actor's faces but ultimately bores the audience, at least me and a very small minority it appears. Like I said in the beginning I can't understand for the life of me how anybody in their right mind could give this a 10 star rating. When I saw that, I was concerned that I was going insane. The deluge of jokes was cringe-worthy and detached any sense of weight the events of this movie had. I give this a 3, a very charitable 3. I pray for the souls that gave this movie a 10."
7 November 2019,JaneHall12,1,1,7,Yikes,"Thor's character is great with the other Avengers, but he just doesn't do that well as a stand-alone character with his own storyline. It's sad because he had so much potential too."

2 January 2019,JakeBrinkman,2,7,8,A great movie dulled by the titular character,"First off, this isn't a Thor movie. This is a Chris Hemsworth movie. The decision to allow him to improvise his lines is arguably the worst decision in the MCU to date. Hemsworth's Americanized swagger and humor completely clash against the character of Thor to the point where I could not see the character of Thor on screen, only Hemsworth.However, if they had scripted Hemsworth more strictly, this movie probably would have received a 9 or 10 from me. Several scenes are quite epic, funny (not including Hemsworth's jokes), and moving."

8 November 2017,goahzlem,12,22,10,Greato,"Movie generally felt different that previous 2 movies, it felt more like Guardians of the Galaxy with other Thor crews + guests. Great fun and would recommend to anyone who watched MCU movies cause if you have not watched like Avengers or other movie that is related to this movie previously, would not follow the story line that well."
8 June 2018,JeffOA,1,1,6,A mishmash of ideas,"Ragnarok while being a fun movie felt extremely dull regarding overall tone and execution. Two stories mashed into one movie.
It has fun moments like the arena planet scenes, but the Ragnarok part of the plot is rather tone deaf. Odin's 'scene' is rushed and void of emotional impact. Acting is weird at times, especially Loki's lines were delivered weirdly at a few places and the writing/humour falls flat often throughout.
Moreover the directing is rather mixed too, resulting in failed moments and causing some of the problems mentioned before. Because of this action scenes often shot in a way that eliminates tension and impact. The army massacre scene was particularly unbelievably weak. The CGI is rather inconsistent too. Some of the scenes were really unimpressive, felt half-complete while others looked cool.
I would also add that the visual and musical style also felt weird, the film having a kind of 80s vibe, with almost game-like sequences with pumping 'rock' music then of course the usual mythological-superhero crossover music came in at a few places. This further adds to the confusion whether this supposed to be an action oriented, fun movie or a more cataclysmic story of destruction and loss. In the end the dual story line might have been the biggest issue in the movie. These are two very different sides of the same universe and does not add up to a coherent experience.
My favourite scenes from the movie that I really liked are definitely from the arena. Though there are problems there aplenty too like Hulk being advertised as a killing machine then after the fight showing him as a sobered down version of himself joking around and being adorable. This is weird as hell. I would even call this lazy writing which is nothing new in this genre.
Another thing which is not really an issue for me but which can be a kind of lore-breaking decision is to cast a mixed race woman as a valkyrie. Though once again I am not sure how accurate this based on the comic books but mythologically it seems to be rather conflicting. Nevertheless it was not a huge thing overall, and on the other hand I am quite happy with Heimdall's portrayal to be honest.
Overall based on my first watch Ragnarok felt a rather rushed movie with mixed execution. The Thor series is the weakest of the standalone ones (on the level of the Hulk movies maybe), Ragnarok being the latest and possibly the best so far. I am sure that the character and related universe can be used to come up with a great story but so far the Thor franchise was let down by filmmakers. This film was a great chance to prove the worthiness and relevance of it but they wanted a little bit too much and tried too hard to be bigger and more filled than the previous resulting in a chaotic mess."
16 February 2018,Genti24,5,22,9,Best Thor ever,"This is the best Thor has ever been. For people complaining about Thor making jokes and what not, those same people complained when Thor: The Dark World came out and it was more serious. 
The action is great, the acting is on point and the visuals are a treat. I love the interactions between the characters and the presence of Hulk in the movie just made it all the more fun and better. It is indeed a very funny movie with high stakes and one of the best MCU films to date, though I still like Spider-Man: Homecoming a bit more."
5 September 2020,leecoles1977,12,25,1,I feel angry,"The first Thor introduced us to a respectful, classy and believable medieval kind of world. The film made you smile in places, but the good storyline was told with respect. Number had the same feel but more action. However, this film, if that's what you can call it, is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Completely makes a mockery of the 2 films before it, turned in to comedy only equaled to a rubbish tv program. The effects are plastic, textures badly rendered, movement not organic or even robotic, just, rubbish. Chris Hemsworth does his best to keep it going with sheer personality, but the acting is so badly delivered, pathetic attempts at belly laughs and the constant need for florence and bright lights... like watching a badly drawn cartoon. Worst film over ever seen, giving the dvd to a charity shop."
1 November 2017,patriciak-1,11,21,3,Just disappointing,"As a long-term fan of Thor/Avengers films, I expected the action drama with 3-dimentional characters and, obviously,I expected Ragrarok. What I've got - just a plain buddy-comedy, entertaining, but without any real depth in it. Great actors couldn't save the movie due to the stupid plot and bad directing. Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett and Anthony Hopkins - what a waste of your talants! Marvel, I understand your attempt to get more of the teenages' audience. But as the result you've just lost 1 adult fan. And I don't think I'm alone in my disappointment. I doubt I'll go to the Infinity War."

13 November 2017,prateekhemdev,3,6,6,Marvelous Disappointment,This is an attempt by Marvel to make an action movie funny but the attempt falls flat. Though Hemsworth and Blanchett seem to be having fun doing this but it does not come out naturally. The action scenes are a treat to watch with Ruffalo showcasing yet again a great performance as The Hulk. Overall the film suffers because of the director's style of portraying Thor not as a superhero but as an individual struggling being a prisoner at the other side of the universe.
29 April 2019,iguth,2,6,9,IM LAUGHING,"This movie doesn't feel like a Thor movie. When I think about Ragnarok, it feels to me more like an experience of a sort. The movie does what Iron Man 3 does for Tony but this time for Thor, that is he must learn to be an epic hero without relying on his weapon. It provides a nice explanation of Banners whereabouts while setting up Infinity War. I want to say more about the production of the movie but it really is just a standard Marvel film. The reason it is one of the better films is because it is SO FUNNY. This movie could easily be labeled as a comedy because it is filled to the brink with jokes. Usually this many jokes would make the audience cringe, here however thanks in part to the hilarious supporting cast, EVERY joke lands. Korg, Loki, Doctor Strange, and The Grandmaster all have time to flex their comedic muscles one last time."
10 September 2018,mobadizhere,2,5,10,The best in the Thor series!,"Thor Ragnarok is far better than Thor 1 and 2, because this film is not dull in the slightest, whereas Thor 1 and 2 we're extremely boring. Having the Hulk really made my decision to see it in theaters, but at the same time, Watiti's direction in Ragnarok makes it worth while! This film is hilarious and fun, and is one of Marvel's best films!"

                        ","A little too polished, but very entertaining and fun","This was the second Marvel film I watched this week (Homecoming being the other), and it reinforced what the franchise does well - which is to entertain. Not all the films achieve this, but Thor Ragnarok certainly does. It takes its lead very much from the stylish and retro fun of Guardians of the Galaxy, but it has an awkward humor that is very much its own. This is really its main selling point, as the film displays great comic timing throughout, with plenty of very good moments drawing good laughs and fun.At times the film feels a bit too engineered and designed. It is such a change from the previous Thor films (which didn't embrace this silliness quite as much) that it does stand out for its difference, but yet at the same time the accessible entertainment value makes it fit very well beside the more recent Marvel films, in particular the comedy tone of Guardians of the Galaxy. This carries it well, and it does own it surprisingly well; it helps that the cast all get it throughout, there is no feeling of everyone working in one direction while a different direction was trying to be found. The silly tone works, while not detracting from the general plot, which is a frame at best, but yet works.The times it tries to have weight don't really manage to stand up, but otherwise there is a lot to like in a film that is entertaining, slick, well timed, and with everyone aligned to what it is trying to do."
5 January 2019,skotadopsychos,6,11,5,"Too much humour, not so much importance",I don't get what people is excited about... Could have easily been more serious and meaningful.
1 March 2019,hatebreed-84135,2,3,8,Great,This film has great CGI and a funny cast. A job well done all around! And that soundtrack!!!
21 September 2018,kaceyd-86992,6,9,1,Overkill with the Comedy!!!,"Thor is such a great and epic hero. Why did they ruin such a great story by throwing in constant joke after joke after joke?! Some comedy is of course appreciated, but this was just making a fool out of every single character. It was impossible to feel any feelings towards them and connect to the story. I could not feel the tragedy and the triumph that this had the potential for. I am really hoping and wishing that another Thor movie comes out and returns to its original tone. This was just terrible..."
10 June 2021,tobywilkes,9,18,10,Unusual but a pleasant surprise,"Looking through the reviews, I noticed that most reviews were saying that it was a film for five-year-olds or ""pre-teens"". I disagree.In my personal opinion, I liked how it didn't take itself too seriously. Sometimes, films can seem to drag on because of it and you fall asleep before it kicks off. Ragnarok cleverly integrated jokes and homages throughout, resulting in a light hearted film that's easy to watch.I also love the bold colours and dress design. I think that, because the planet (Sakaar) had never been seen before in the MCU, it gave a blank canvas for the team to make something new.Maybe my admiration towards Taika Waititi (Director) sullied my review a little however I truly believe that you will enjoy this movie if I have persuaded you enough."
5 November 2017,Screen_Blitz,2,9,9,"Arguably the most daunting entry of the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok takes its titular hero to subversive heights, sending its trilogy to a stunning conclusion","Where were Thor and Hulk during the drama of 'Captain America: Civil War'? This question is answered in this third and final chapter of the Thor trilogy. Going out with a bang, Thor: Ragnorak shows director Taika Watiti, the man behind the fairly underseen 'Hunt for The Wilder People', embracing the glamorous spirit of the eponymous Marvel Comics hero and exercising it with flying colors, while constructing the veins to the events of the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. And for the tasty extra, Hulk is in on this one, making for yet another opportunity to take the Avengers and cross them over with their film's shared universe. Following its predecessor 'Dark World', this second sequel improves upon its predecessor in many ways while adding something fresh to build upon an exciting special-effects-heavy thrill ride without dedicating too much time on establishing connections with the MCU. The concluding result is a whiplash of a superhero spectacle that competes with both 'Logan' and last summer's 'Wonder Woman' for the crown of superhero film of the year. Chris Hemsworth strikes back in his role as Thor who, along with his mischievous brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), is warned by their father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) of the escape of their estranged older sister Hela (played by Cate Blanchett), the God of Death who is set to wreck havoc on the realm of Asgard. Crashing on a mysterious planet run by an eccentric grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum), they cross paths with Asgard warrior Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) and Thor's former ally Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) who is he forced to fight against in a gladiator battle. Together, they must build their alliance to make their way back to Asgard to bring down the evil Hela before it's too late. Explosively entertaining and compelling in its comic book roots, this third entry of Thor's stand-alone franchise boasts just about everything a cinematic rendition of the eponymous god of thunder should be. Visually arresting in its production design and action sequences is one of them but perhaps the least surprising considering the MCU's reputation on feasting the eyes of cutting special effects. It takes an uncompromising effort to build upon a franchise and make it fun as ever, let alone surpassing its predecessor's in the level of excitement. Ultimately, director Taika Watiti proves trustworthy. From the opening sequence of Thor battling against the fiery demon, to his arrival on the unknown planet, to the final battle against the villain Hela; audiences are strapped tightly for a wild ride. And this does not go without mentioning the cast taking the advantage of delivering laughs each time they get the chance. While the banter between Thor and Loki is as charming as ever, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk later comes into the picture to share an outrageous comedic chemistry with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson that allows viewers to relish in the laugh-out- loud nature of its heroes. There is even a laugh-worthy moment with Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who offers a nice unexpected cameo in an early scene. Jeff Goldblum has his funny gags here and there, but perhaps doesn't quite reach to the peak of the show stealer which belongs to Mark Ruffalo, especially as the story makes the clever decision of expanding upon his character arc which was neglected in previous incarnations. But what about Cate Blanchett? That's right. Stepping outside her usual good girl persona to portray the devious God of Death resembling more devilish-looking version of Maleficent, Blanchett shines the role with menacing intensity, a performance to audaciously defy against the her more human typecasting. Probably not a role who would expect to see Oscar nominated actress from 'Carol' in. Thor: Ragnarok weaves its franchise to a stunning conclusion while appropriately building a bridge to the upcoming Avengers sequel when all our heroes will be given their time to shine. This movie delivers one hell of a good time, securing its destiny to please fans and a small portion of non-fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, box office gold is waiting in its path."
3 November 2017,sheridan-turner,3,7,6,I waited all this time......for this?,"I watched Planet Hulk back in 2006. Loved it!!!I watched Avengers assemble and the Mighty Avengers animation. Loved it. I love the Thor and Hulk friendship and rivalry.So when they announced this movie and I saw the first trailer, I was convinced that lightning was finally going to strike home and that this movie would meet or beat all expectations. So I waited.....and waited. I saw more trailers and clips. I scoured You-Tube for more footage. I talked about this we friends. I was going crazy waiting for this to be released.Today...finally.....in Tokyo......I went to the premiere. Well.....sad to say it......but I was a little let down. First of all......it was way too many attempts at slapstick cheap humor. Even Thor was trying to be funny or cute. He never did that in the comics.Hulk was like a big goofy kid who could barely hold his own against Thor. I expected a lot more but OK......this was acceptable. After all, this is a Thor movie, not a Hulk movie.Also, would have been nice to capture more story while on Sakaar. Many things happened in the comic and animated movie. Including a love interest for Hulk. In this movie.....nothing, even though he had been there for quite a long while.Banners character was also a goofy whiny pouty teenage girl in the movie. I did not like that. It was not cute.I suspect that teenagers and children will love this movie. But I think adults will not appreciate it. For such a dark movie with dire conclusions, it is still too upbeat and happy, even at the ending.Hopefully, when this is released on Bluray, there will be directors cut, that might make it more serious. I have to admit though, I do like the direction that Hulk seems to be going/growing.Well.....I will still purchase the Bluray, just because I have too because of the Hulk. I just wish that Hulk Kicked ass more. There was no straight up Hulk Smashing! That's all I am saying. This is the first time that I have seen Thor so damn....Mighty.Good job Marvel! When I watched the Avengers.....and Banner transformed into the Hulk and started killing those giant flying aliens......I asked my wife to marry me...again. I was so damn happy and excited. She, however, was not amused by my proposal though. Anyway.....I did not feel that same excitement today....not even close. Dammit. There was no laughter or energy in the theater either. Maybe the language barrier while reading subtitles?"

30 June 2020,marin-77678,8,18,1,Mockery of a great character,I'll get to the point. Stick to the comics. The higher ups at Marvel have no idea how to handle a truly epic hero despite over 40 years of source material. Their answer? Let's make it funny! I've been reading Thor comics for 30 years. I absolutely hate the MCU Thor.
29 October 2017,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2,14,6,"While it is entertaining, this somewhat messy piece never creates a genuine emotional connection to any of its characters; still, it's the best of the three solo 'Thor' films.","To say 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' is best of the three solo 'Thor' films, which it almost certainly is despite its tonal differences, may be faint praise but it's praise nevertheless. This generally entertaining, if somewhat messy piece, gets better once its plot is properly underway, which sadly takes around half of its runtime. At this point, the new comedic approach meshes with the pseudo sci-fi aesthetics to create a truly distinct entry in the 'MCU'. Though this unique approach isn't entirely successfully and is occasionally feels a little at odds with the core characters, it ultimately makes the piece a lot more fun than it likely otherwise would have been. It doesn't quite manage to hit all of its emotional beats, but it does manage to keep you entertained (again, much more in its second half) and is actually a lot more plot-focused than you may expect. It typically does a good job with its characters, although the villainess is a little weak, and is often genuinely enjoyable. It's funny at times, too. The first half is a bit of a slog, though, and the end result isn't as compelling or affecting as you'd hope. Still, it will probably satisfy disillusioned Thor fans, so long as they don't mind changing his DNA a little; it's certainly better than either of his previous two outings. 6/10."
26 October 2017,goodtime-336-74081,6,23,5,Misses the mark,"Went to see Thor: Ragnarok with an open mind as I am a regular movie goer, at least once a week year in year out. Was not expecting anything beyond the usual Marvel output which is usually reasonably entertaining. Ragnarok, falls short in a number of ways not the least of which was the annoying attempts at humor. The humor was puerile and aimed more at the prepubescent rather than anyone with a developed sense of humor above the most rudimentary level, as evidenced by the fact that in a theater of some 400 mainly Millennials there was only one collective laugh and that was Thor and the bowling ball. Apart from that there only a couple of isolated titters. The movie on the whole appears to be aimed at a Grade School intellect, starting from the ridiculous lead in intro with Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi, and a movie fan prior to the movie commencing. The movie relied far too much on CGI which wasn't up to standard and over the top at times. Hemsworth's performance is generic and bland while Ruffalo puts in his usual average effort. Blanchett was the Star of the show while the rest of the cast were OK but don't blink or you will miss Idris Elba's performance. Looking at the 10/10s given on IMDb on opening day one can only assume they are from studio/corporate hacks to boost the ratings rather than from genuine IMDb contributors. Time for a change in the way reviews are published."
28 April 2020,shikhakumarisinha,4,7,8,good movie,I like the movie . Chris hemsworth as thor was really good . I like the hulk part too and the comedy scene between hulk and thor. We see the new thing about thor who appear as God of thunder.

23 January 2018,siderite,1,5,7,Better and worse than I expected,"The thing to remember when watching this movie is that it will never make any sense. Repeat it as a mantra until you believe it and you will enjoy it thoroughly. Half of it happens on a garbage planet that had no connection with the Marvel Universe, the second in the feudal surroundings of Asgaard, the crown of the known Universe. Wait, what? Hey, take me back to the garbage planet, man! So the story is not really relevant, I mean you know it from the trailer: bad Hela comes, bad Hela goes. I really hoped they would reach some sort of new dynamic of the brothers, now that they have a sister, but they go the standard direction of the psychotic overpowered and ultimately dumb villain. So what remains are the characters. And the thing is that the movie is entertaining. From the action scenes, the slapstick humor, the ridiculous cameos and the completely over the top... everything, the movie is fun. So fun, in fact, that it feels like a parody.What I think happened is that some execs wanted to turn Thor into a Guardians of the Galaxy kind of thing. It was funny, it was ridiculous, but people liked it. What they didn't understand is that there are a lot more movies that are both funny and ridiculous and no one gives them the time of day. So I was both entertained and completely disappointed in the movie. After all, it is a Thor movie, I shouldn't have had high expectations, and I always knew that the best scenes were in the trailer anyway, but when they take a whole legendary planet and portray it as one of those Stargate SG-1 places where everybody wears rags and lives in a single village, I can't help but cringe.Bottom line: Kids will probably love it. It's a good movie to watch drunk or high. Other than that, it's mediocre."

19 June 2018,beladornon2,4,12,10,Thor: Ragnarok - Review,"The reviews on here are split pretty evenly between haters and lovers. Who are the haters? They are the humorless, the self-important, and most of all- the desperate alpha-male wannabes. Who am I? I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!To start with, the cast is the best Thor so far, devoid of the annoying whining and bulimic neck-wasting of Portman and the tedium of the Warriors Three (Lady Sif is MIA, however...). Instead, we have the Valkyrie, who is a real and very interesting woman, plus the delightful Urban as Skurge, complete with failed-male accoutrement such as shake weights and AR-15s. And best of all, The most excellent Blanchett as Hela, a true show stopper. The denizens of Sekaar are also hugely fun, as is the extremely talented Ruffalo. The production is superb, with Sekaar ranking as one of the most original worlds created so far. DEVO's Mothersbaugh's music is perfect. Goldberg's performance becomes funnier and more menacing every time I watch it, while Hemsworth finally has a script where he can stretch his comic talent as well as his dramatic chops. And as Joss Whedon discovered, Chris will hit every comic moment out of the park, if you give him the chance. I can't even count the number of wonderful comic moments in this film, it's that golden. Much of the credit also belongs to Taika Waititi, the NZ wunderkind. His Korg is the perfect anti-dote to all the alpha-male testosterone that passes for film in the DC-verse (may it soon die forever). Here's a giant powerful creature with a mind, a snappy wit, and no desire to hog the glory. Take note, all you one-star haters! What said haters of this film want is another unwatchably tedious and monotonous MAN OF STEEL-style piece of garbage, utterly devoid of anything but grimacing, shouting, punching and brooding. Luckily, what we have in Ragnarok instead is wit, style, and excitement. Long Live THOR and MARVEL!!! Excelsior!"
23 May 2019,draganerion,3,7,4,Not Thor but half Thor half Avengers,"No original story, more like Thor in Night club who have flashbacks of who he was. 50% of movie has Thor original story and its fine and good, but other 50 % is Avangers promotion and it is not what Thor should be."
22 December 2019,davesawesomeinbox,2,5,9,Awesome,"Con 1:))) I will admit though that there is less of the mythology magical feel in this third installment than there was in Thor 1. So I came close to missing that feel of which I had adored in Thor 1. However I had no time to notice or feel negative about that because this Thor 3 kept me constantly captivated and entertained with an awesome feel of its own.Con 2:))) The other negative was a much bigger one for me. That being the lack of Natalie Portman's character. The romance in Thor 1 between Thor and her...was one of my favorite parts of that film. However I have heard it said that she might well show up in future MCU movies and (crossing my fingers) hopefully they will get to be in love again.Pro: Like ... nearly everything. Humor, lights, synth music, excitement, twists, on and on."
22 July 2018,ghostriderlxl,6,10,1,Slap stick crap,What happened to the action? It's like a carry on film. They have dumbed down the characters. I was so disappointed by this effort.

The 3rd part has turned out much better, of course considerably it was affected by Hulk's appearance. The main minus of the movie - the main antagonist. Hela the most faceless character, about her tell nothing at all and don't show her history. 30 seconds of timing aren't counted., It seems, on a trilogy plot all have told, all holes of the previous parts are closed. I think the 3rd part the best in the trilogy."
27 December 2017,cliftonofun,1,3,8,"Silly, ridiculous, and wildly fun.","Thor is always going to be silly, but this chapter wisely embraced the silliness. Plus, everyone from Hemsworth to Blanchett to Goldblum (and perhaps the best director cameo ever) just plain nailed their roles. Nobody will remember it as original storytelling, but nobody will walk away without being entertained either. From the slapstick to the battles, everything worked. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat."

21 May 2019,SugarandIce,2,5,9,Falling in love with Thor,"What the Russo brothers did for Captain America, Taika Watiti has done for Thor. In place of a Shakespearean hunk, we get a humorous, likable, and compelling hunk. I also love all this film did for Hulk and Loki in characterization. And I must mention its badass and stylish new villain Hela who is a favorite Marvel villain of mine. This film is not lacking in any one thing. In its comedy, it's by far the funniest Marvel film ever. So much is ad-libbed and all else reeks of Taika's genius. I should also mention Taika voices Korg who is the funniest character ever written in a Marvel film. As for the action, this movie shows Thor at his best, far more badass and powerful than he's been in his prior films where his feats were often lacking. The soundtrack is excellent, even without the adrenaline-inducing Immigration Song. The visuals are gorgeous. Even a trash planet is a visual feast to look upon due to the color palette and cinematography. The film's writing is also subtle, with themes of colonialism underlying its plot. And for all its comedy, this film has consequences, twists, and emotional moments. This film is utterly excellent and insanely rewatchable. And now I want to rewatch again right this minute. it's just that good."

9 February 2022,Thanos_Alfie,1,5,7,Funny and entertaining...,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch Thor being imprisoned on another planet but he has to return back to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of it.I enjoyed this movie very much because it contained plenty of interesting scenes but it succeeded even more on combining action with comedy. Something that elevated the movie and made the difference. The direction which was made by Taika Waititi was simply amazing and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters. The interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor was outstanding. Some other interpretations that needs to be mentioned were Cate Blanchett's who played as Hela, Mark Ruffalo's who played as Bruce Banner, Tom Hiddleston's who played as Loki, Tessa Thompson's who played as Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum's who played as Grandmaster. Lastly, I have to say that ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a nice, entertaining movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure it will make you laugh and you will have a great time."
3 November 2017,kjproulx,2,10,9,Marvel Studios Has Done It Again,"The Thor films haven't exactly been my favorite additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but they've still been fun escapes at the cinema upon each release. That being said, Thor: Ragnarok has definitely righted that ship in a new direction, being one of the most enjoyably entertaining films that Marvel Studios has produced since maybe even the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, that's saying a lot, but I haven't been this thoroughly entertained by this franchise in quite some time. Yes, there are far better films throughout this franchise, but this is a very welcome addition and definitely staples itself as the best of the three Thor films. Even if you aren't a fan of these movies, this film feels very different from the others, so if you can go into this movie with an open mind, then I honestly can't praise this movie enough. Here is why Thor: Ragnarok is such a fun experience at the movies.When it comes to the character of Thor (played impeccably well by Chris Hemsworth), he's probably been the least interesting character to be given a solo outing in my opinion, although still enjoyable. This film was able to change my mind on that, injecting eons of humor from start to finish and giving him a much bigger purpose after certain events go down throughout the first act. Chris Hemsworth's performance continues to improve throughout each film, becoming wittier and making you wish for more of him in the future.The plot of this film is as follows; Hela has invaded Asgard and wants to rule all nine realms, as well as everything in the cosmos that surround them. That's simple enough, but add in the fact that Thor and Loki are lost on an unknown planet and must deal with the fact that the Hulk is being used as a puppet in a wrestling arena, all while finding a way back to their homeworld in order to prevent devastation, and you've got one hell of a fun ride. This movie never lets up in terms of pacing, giving us new characters to either laugh with, mourn over, or be given a backstory to. The reason this movie works so well is easily due to the writing and direction by Taika Watiti.Watiti's vision is probably more present than any of the directors throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far. His wacky style and comedic tone makes you feel like you're watching a spoof of the Thor character, but in reality, it's just a fun spin, injecting new life into a portion of this Universe that has been slowly deteriorating. It's very gutsy to give nearly full control of your movie to a director when you have 16 other films to stay in line with and be slightly connected to, but it was definitely a risk worth taking. This is easily one of the funniest films throughout any of these movies, and that never seemed to be a negative throughout my experience. This movie is simply a blast to watch.In the end, although I won't find myself praising this movie for being as fantastic as a Captain America: Civil War, this is easily one of the best sequels that have come from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even though it's still connected and the formula of this series works like a television series that requires you to have seen the previous movies in order to fully understand every little detail, this movie still works on its own as an awesome action/comedy.Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Tessa Thompson, and Mark Ruffalo share some of the best chemistry I've seen all year and even though they're just having fun on set, sometimes that's all that matters when it comes to entertainment. There's just enough emotion to keep the movie going and giving the climax a purpose, and you really do care about who lives and who dies. The visual effects are beautiful to look at on the big screen and the action sequences are incredibly fun to behold. Yes, it follows the formula that most of the films in this franchise do, but it has a new spin that I just ate up. Aside from a few scenes that seem to drag or slow down, Thor Ragnarok really doesn't have a dull moment. This movie is a complete blast from start to finish."

                        ",Certainly not for everybody,"OK, I have to admit it but I just didn't get the humor and the best this movie did was to give me a fleeting smile every now and then. The whole movie simply is all form and little substance murdering its comic book background as well as its Norse mythology origin story. Thor now is completely written into a corner. He's a goof bumbling about in a movie written as a comic relief....but a comic relief from what exactly? Sure, the movie looks great but in an attempt to write the whole plot as lighthearted it just turns out emotionally shallow. There is just ONE scene (the elevator scene) during which we get to see two main characters as more than walking punchlines. All that leaves us with a slightly above average adventure story."
31 October 2018,redinnevada,2,5,10,Best delivery possible!,"All those trashing the show because it had darn near pretty flawless HUMOR in it are quite simply ridiculous. They SHOULD give up on movies/cinema/entertainment PERIOD because they have NO ability to enjoy it unless it fits in their box. Tight joyless boxes.Chris Hemsworth is a funny guy. Tom Hiddleston is a funny guy. Here they got to show it while also delivering a next-in-the-evolution of Asgard with Thor as their king storyline that draws you in and keeps you chuckling.I've watched it 3 times now and still rewind (yah, old-fashioned word) to watch a few of the funnier scenes.It's an enjoyable ride. I'll be watching it AGAIN just to go on it."
23 February 2018,justin-fencsak,1,4,8,This is marvel on LSD!!!,"When Thor first burst on the scene as a teaser at the end of Iron Man 2 with the sound of thunder and a hammer, no one would expect the character to be well loved among marvel hero fans. Chris Hemsworth, an unknown from Australia for American audiences, became the go to guy for big roles, and 2011's Thor, starring him as Thor and Natalie Portman as the earth girl that meets him, became a surprise hit at the summer box office. Thor would later come back in The Avengers a year later where he meets his nemesis, Loki, then returned for Thor The Dark World which outgrossed its predecessor and delved part of it into fantasy. After being MIA in Avengers Age of Ultron, he's back in Thor Ragnarok, a color pallete of a super hero movie which I'm 40 minutes in and enjoying it. It's worth buying online as there is plenty of thrills, laughs, and lots of action and a kick butt soundtrack!! I can't wait to see what Thor is up to when Infinity War comes out when Thor sees the Guardians for the first time...."

Is the world bereft of adults or are we just man-children to adore comic book movies this much? Please people, for the love of god, GROW UP ALREADY! This is for 11 year olds, a wet dream for teenagers at most! What's wrong with IMDB? Getting paid to over hype this trash??"
26 February 2018,michaelkeenan-74493,9,16,1,An embarrassment...,"First I have to say that I am a massive fan of the marvel movie franchise, as well as a massive fan of Thor comics all the way back to Journey into Mystery 83, and indeed the first two Thor movies... So what happened?
Of course superhero movies are stuff and nonsense, but it works because the director and cast take it seriously. The same is true for comedy. If jokes are telegraphed, they don't work... and here we had two hours of hamming it up and mugging for the camera. For British fans we seem to have Carry on up the Fjord, or for those in the U.S., Lewis and Martin are back! Characters who previously had gravitas or indeed a personality become ciphers at best. I can only guess that the cast signed up before reading the script. On the other hand Director Taika Waititi must be congratulated for persuading really very fine actors to give truly poor performances. I just don't have the words... an embarrassment!"
4 September 2018,Uriah43,1,7,6,Ample Amounts of Comedy and Action,"This movie begins with ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) having been captured by a giant demon named ""Surtur"" (a CGI with the voice of Clancy Brown) who intends to kill him very soon. But before doing this Surtur tells Thor that his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) has mysteriously abandoned Asgard which will now allow him to fulfill the prophecy known as Ragnorok and thereby entirely destroy that vaunted realm. Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter ""Hela"" (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie which contained ample amounts of action and comedy. Unfortunately, some of the comedy seemed a bit unnecessary and the numerous subplots sometimes made it difficult to follow as well. But all in all it was an entertaining film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

1 January 2018,Wuchakk,1,7,9,"""Asgard is not a place, it's a people""","RELEASED IN 2017 and directed by Taika Waititi, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" covers events in Asgard & surrounding realms when Thor's older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), takes over Asgard while the God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) is banished to a garbage planet run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Thor proceeds to put together a dubious team to (try to) take back his home world. Tom Hiddleston plays Loki, Mark Ruffalo Bruce Banner and Tessa Thompson Valkyrie. Anthony Hopkins and Benedict Cumberbatch are also on hand as Odin and Dr. Strange respectively. I'm a fan of the first two Thor flicks, but this one is the best. It has the most compelling plot, the most interesting guest stars, and adds a little more humor to the proceedings while keeping a nice balance between the amusing parts and the serious ones. Some parts are even moving, like The Executioner's story arc (Karl Urban), whilst some are profound (e.g. Odin's revelation about Asgard). Much of the humor is laugh-out-loud funny.Blanchett is utterly badaxx (even hot) as the villainess and, believe it or not, this is the best depiction of the Hulk yet on the screen. He has more dialogue here than in his four previous appearances on the big screen combined (i.e. ""Hulk,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""). In addition, the guest appearance by Dr. Strange is exceptional.Like ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), Marvel just knocked it out of the ballpark with this one. THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 10 minutes. WRITERS: Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost. GRADE: A"
2 January 2018,gavinp9,1,3,8,"Fun, fast and mostly light-hearted","'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best 'Thor' film so far, and one of Marvel's best overall - up there with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for laughter and excitement. Thor (Hemsworth) has full licence from director Waititi ('Boy', 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople') to unleash all his humour and charm, which starts very early on, but still allowing big action/battle scenes to unfurl. Loki (Hiddleston) & Odin (Hopkins) are back, but so is their sister, Hela (Blanchett), Goddess of Death, intent on unleashing ""Ragnarok"" on Asgard - the end of days.It's not all doom and gloom though, as Thor and Loki get trapped on a literal dump-planet, where we meet the Grandmaster (Goldblum) - basically an eccentric Roman emperor, who hosts Gladiator duels. Goldblum gets some great lines and steals almost every scene he's in. This is where Hulk (Ruffalo) comes in and is apparently where he's been since 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Some great moments shared between Hulk and Thor, as Thor is trying to escape so he can rescue the people of Asgard from Hela. He's helped by a fallen Valkyrie (Thompson), who eventually comes around.The score is great, and while 80s-synth-ish, is mostly understated. What does stand out is the colour and vibrancy of almost every set - plenty to catch the eye in every shot. But what sets this film apart is it's humour and pacing. Korg, a rock-monster (voiced by Waititi himself) has some great moments, especially since his Kiwi accent stands out so strongly against the rest of the cast. There's a strong Antipodean slant to proceedings, with Waititi, Hemsworth, Blanchett, Karl Urban, Rachel House and Sam Neill all having an impact. A great fight scene at the end, but still plenty of quips and slapstick thrown in. End credit scene sets up 'Avengers: Infinity War' nicely."
30 November 2019,Hitchcoc,2,26,8,I Thought It Was Pretty Good,"Having a son who really loves these comic book movies stretches my appreciation for such presentations. We did watch the first one together years ago and it was decent. Since I'm way past the time when I would have read a comic book featuring most of these characters, I treated it as a movie, only using what happened in the first one as a reference point. I have extensive knowledge of the classics and a long time interest in world mythology. You folks who are all bent out of shape that the mythology got screwed up in this movie need to realize that it is totally screwed up in the comic books. Except for excessive battle scenes which eventually seem to be the same old same old, I rather liked the humor and the plotting. I may even go and see the next one. I'm hoping I don't have to keep saying to my adult son, ""Now, who is that guy?"" Oh, I did like the guy made out of rocks."

15 September 2019,lukem-52760,2,15,8,A HILARIOUS FANTASY ADVENTURE MARVEL MASTERPIECE,"Thor:Ragnarok is an utterly hilarious fantasy adventure & the third part of the Thor Trilogy, Thor has become probably my favourite Avenger, i love Captain America & Hawkeye but Thor is just as great & is so much fun.The comedy here is perfect, perfect moment comic timing, the funny buddy chemistry between Thor & Hulk is so much fun & makes me want more adventures with these guys!!!Ragnarok is a massive budget, beautiful looking Marvel MASTERPIECE along with The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers Assemble,
Avengers:Age of Ultron, Avengers:infinity wars & Avengers:End Game, i believe these to be the best movies of the MCU & are the ""Marvel Masterpieces"" in my opinion.
This 3rd Thor adventure is full on action-packed fun & full of beautiful production design & amazing sets & stunning special fx, there's so many hilarious moments that is was a total joy sitting through this movie, Chris Hemsworth is a hilarious guy & here he gives it his all & gifts us with his greatest performance as Thor & he's absolutely amazing!!!
A great new hero & character comes in the form of hard drinking & tough as nails warrior ""Valkyrie"" who's played fantasticly by Tessa Thompson, she's Awesome & a great new friend & hero to help Thor.
The incredible ""Hulk"" is perfectly played once again by Mark Ruffalo, he's hilarious & does some amazing fight scenes & some funny as hell behaviour bits & great scenes.
Bad brother ""Loki"" is great in this movie, he's still slimey & sneaky but much more fun & silly & has some really funny bits throughout & shows he's still got a heart after all & does love his brother ""Thor"", a great performance by Tom Hiddleston.
Even veteran actor Jeff Goldblum is here as a hilarious games master called ""Grandmaster"" & he's great.
The always excellent but underrated Karl Urban has a good role as ""The Executioner"" a good guy who turns to the darkside for abit but not by choice & comes back fighting for Asgard, Urban is a great actor & starred in one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE & that's ""Dredd"" he was outstanding as Judge Dredd.Ragnarok has a huge cast of great actors & great characters, we also have Cate Blanchet as the evil villain of this movie ""Helena"" & there's Idris Elba who ruturns as ""Heimdall"" old friend of Thor, actor legend Anthony Hopkins returns in a small role as father ""Odin"" & a great new hilarious character joins the wacky cast ""Korg"" a soft speaking rock monster who becomes a friend of Thor's & he's hilariously voiced by the director of this film Taika Waititi, lots of fun & adventure spilling out of this film.The music is excellent & very retro 80s style, the movies cinematography is stunning with popping colourful imagery & beautiful detail, this is easily the best ""Thor"" movie & easily one of the greatest ""Marvel"" movies ever made & an instant CLASSIC comic book movie!!!
This sets the bar so high for comic book movies & fantasy adventure films, this has it all."

1 December 2017,CountJonnie,1,3,7,"Decent, but ""too much"", not unlike GotG2.","Cap. 1 and 2, Thor 1, GotG1 and Avengers 1 were refreshing. Just as the superhero market seemed repetitive, Marvel gave us a very refreshing Doc. Strange and Ant-Man. And now Thor 3, which is fun, but far from refreshing.Thor has a background rooted in mythology and themes such as responsibility and family. Something that shines in a well developed relation between Thor, his father Odin, and his half-brother Loki, aided by the simple and likable Hulk who was more of a character in this movie, and not just a fun gimmick.Also in Thor 3, the focus is on family again. This is well explained through the under-used Odin, and even in his few scenes, Anthony Hopkins steals the show. So does Tom Hiddleston who shows his internal struggle, but also provides a lighter note. It is Hela (Blanchett) however, who carries this movie on her back, through a menacing and convincing performance as a new villain and a page out of Thor's family history. Unfortunately Thor himself was not well developed. The writers had the chance to make him grow into a more mature and godlike person, with the changes he does make. But unfortunately that process gets buried under the countless jokes, one-liners, slapstick and buddy humour, added with countless pointless cameos and a Grandmaster who was more a comedian, than a menacing, mysterious entity.As perfect as some jokes are, as brilliant as the timing is, it is a pity that this downgrades a beautiful mythology into a (still likable but also) silly comedy, only to rise above that mediocrity every moment Hela and Odin appear on screen. Especially Hela who shines in dialogue and in action. I hope to see more of her in future installments."

I'm not a big fan of Thor but I have watched the first two Thor and other MCU movies. This is the worse one ever. I suppose Thor to be a serious hero but there are full of jokes and stand up comedy. It's not telling the story and not making the audience to focus. I was watching it at home and I felt I could walk around anytime. What a tragedy!

13 March 2022,rahul000994,1,3,10,"Thor: Ragnarok Is A Joyous Romp That Makes Thor, The Most Lovable Avenger !!!","From the very first look at Marvel's latest outing, it became apparent that there was something unique about 'Thor: Ragnarok'. More vibrant than its two prequels, and combined with a quirky sense of humour, it reunites us with two larger-than-life superheroes - Thor and the Hulk, both of whom we haven't seen since 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' in 2015. From the outset, it's evident how well these two play with, and against each other, continuing their love-hate bromance established in the first 'Avengers' film. Additionally, the film is infused with Taika Waititi's trademark style of oddball comedy and while he plays wonderfully within Marvel's sandbox, his imprint is evident in every frame and dialogue. Additionally, it translates very well on screen in all the performances from the ensemble cast.Stuffed between that is a two-hour 10-minute wild, colourful, and funny roller-coaster ride put together by Taika Waititi, it's the perfect kind of escapist entertainment, one which treats its narrative as a background element than the driving force, and Waititi - off a script penned by Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost, and Eric Pearson - knows exactly what (half) the Avengers need, having become a bit humdrum and repetitive in recent entries, such as 2015's Age of Ultron, and 2016's Captain America: Civil War. It takes the same exuberance that powered this year's Spider-Man: Homecoming, and applies it on a cosmic sale, with tons of magic and punches thrown in. Like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, only less forced.On a plot level, Ragnarok has connections to events from its 2013 predecessor Thor: The Dark World, and 2015's Age of Ultron, rather than last year's Civil War, since it takes place in parallel to the latter film. With those films now two and four years old, it can take time to register some things if you don't plan to refresh yourself before heading in. Here are the basics: Thor has been travelling the Nine Realms to forestall the vision he had in Age of Ultron, while Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is continuing to rule Asgard by impersonating their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), who's been exiled to Earth.It's there that Thor meets Tessa Thompson's fascinating new addition, billed simply as Valkyrie. The film never provides her a name, alternating between a code assigned to her on Sakaar, and Valkyrie being the name of the ancient Asgardian outfit she was part of, a past she's now hiding from, having failed at performing her duties. Written as a hard-drinking uncaring force of nature, she captures Thor and delivers him to the Grandmaster, for use in his gladiator-style games that are central to culture and life on Sakaar.Valkyrie's introduction is one of the standout moments of Ragnarok, as she arrives inebriated and unable to even walk properly, before blasting everyone away with her Pacific Rim-style fighter jet. The latter part is also a rare bit of innovation in the action set-piece department, which is otherwise the weakest point of Waititi's direction, likely stemming from his inexperience in that area. Most of the action sequences tend to involve a super-being ripping through hordes of soldiers while performing unrealistic acrobatic manoeuvres. Every time Ragnarok kick-starts a fight, you'll be left wishing it ended and got back to doing what it does best.On Ragnarok, Ruffalo's time in his performance capture suit is expanded beyond just destroying things with his presence, with the big green guy's personality developing to include a rudimentary style of speaking too. He's a massively dumbed down version of Banner, the man with seven Ph. Ds, and Hulk's interests do not extend beyond sleep, training and smashing things. That child-like quality further contributes to the film's comedic chops, with the Hulk dealing in straight-faced banter. Referring to himself as ""raging fire"" at one point, he dubs Thor a ""smouldering fire"".The punchlines and one-liners keep rolling off the assembly line across Ragnarok, and most of the humour feels natural, with only bits and parts coming across a bit forced in their attempt to liven up the proceedings. Waititi makes great use of Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange cameo too, relying on the actor's comedic timing, handling the character's other-worldly abilities in a delightful, cracking fashion, and contrasting it by showing how incomprehensible and jarring they would be for someone who's not used to them.By the end of the film, Thor understands his responsibilities and abilities much better than before, and he's left in a state that constantly reminds him about Odin. Unfortunately, not everyone gets the same long-arc treatment, with Blanchett, Ruffalo, and Idris Elba (who reprises his role as the Bifröst sentry Heimdall) feeling underserved, given the acting credentials they bring to the table. Expanding on that would have naturally resulted in a longer film, and one that wouldn't have the momentum Ragnarok has now.Thor: Ragnarok is a joyous continuation of that spirit, one that allows you to have fun while Thor's new squad cracks open alien heads and extended jokes. They've even got a silly name for themselves, just like the Avengers. We won't spoil that for you."
1 November 2017,charliep14,3,12,7,is it a comedy or a superhero movie?,"On the positive side, Thor Ragnarok looks fantastic. One also can't say it's a boring movie: lots of things happen, lots of jokes are cracked, lots of action scenes etc etc. Also, it's obvious the Director and the Team are having fun with it. So, yes, it's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imaginationBUT... I left feeling like the movie was treating Thor like the butt of a joke? The Director has so much fun with the material he forgot to take it seriously, and, by the same token to give it any kind of weight. Loki was a major threat in many Marvel movies and now is either a C Grade villain or B Grade sidekick; worlds explode and this basically only the source of a joke, etc. Nothing is taken seriously so it's almost too light. At best you feel like you're watching a children's movie, at worst you feel like you're watching a comedy that disguised itself as a superhero movie?"

                        ",this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch!,"The hype and reputation of this movie set expectations in a weird place. Critic reception is through the roof and some talk of it being a pure comedy tuned out to be grossly exaggerated. First and foremost the film has a proper amount of gravitas. It's not overtly ""jokey"" Scenes and actions have real weight. Thor and Loki both have great character arcs and both characters are fleshed out quite well. The very beginning did give me pause. I feared that the early tone and rather light handling of epic characters from the books would make me hate this film. How Surtur, Skurge, Volstagg and Fandril are handled in the first 15 minutes frankly ticked me off. Even Loki seemed off at first. Yet, as the film unfolded most everything fell in to place nicely and everything seemed to fit the movie perfectly.The action and the visuals are as amazing as advertised. Even Valkyrie worked as a character even though I was not sold on the casting choice. She could easily be any Valkyrie and not the specific one from the books. This third effort puts a wonderful bow on the trilogy with healthy nods to the previous two films. Yet, this certainly stands on its own and is very unique. Hela is a superb villain and this is the best Hemsworth has ever been. Allowed to settle after a stumbling start, this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch."
11 November 2017,generationofswine,1,6,7,An Honest Review,"OK, this isn't what the advertisements say, at least its not the best Marvel movie (I think that title stills goes to Winter Soldier). That being said, it IS the best Thor movie.It is certainly an escape from the normal Thor movies. It's an escape from the Asgardcentric feel of Dark World. And, well, the best parts of the first Thor were the parts when he was on Earth.Here we have more humor in the film, which isn't unique for Thor, but this one has more of an Antman feel, or at least it has the humor we saw in the Thor Spots around Civil War.It works, the humor plays very well and it's done, well, perfectly. Thor's humor is almost in the vein of a jovial meathead and a very likable one. Plus, Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing and sensibilities. He knows how to deliver a joke in a believable way without going over-the-top.It works.And, of course, Tom Hiddleston works exceptionally well with the lead.Mark Ruffalo has returned and he has been gone far too long. Far too long. And, really, Hulk is the best character to pit with Thor, both in his green form and as Banner.I'd go further, but that would lead into spoilers, but it was nice to see a spin on World War Hulk, and it did leave the door wide open for another Thor story...And if they do continue this saga, it would be wonderful to see it done in the same way.This was a great break from the previous Thor films, which, especially with Dark World, felt kind of like a chore."
20 March 2021,vybrans,6,12,9,Loved it.,"This was mad fun. I love everything about this movie. It did what it intended to do and I really, really enjoyed it."
17 March 2018,SeriousMayhem,1,2,7,The Thor Outtakes - a mixed bag.,"I wasn't overly impressed by the fact that Thor went the Deadpool/Guardians of the Galaxy route and I still can't say I like the decision, but overall it didn't turn out as bad as I had anticipated.Personally, I prefer the more serious, darker and grittier Thor movies. If I want comedy and action, I'd actually watch Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy. But lately there seems to be a trend with Marvel, that there needs to be humor, everywhere. To appeal to kids, I guess? So now I can watch Thor as well if I want comedy.. meh.The humor often is childish, slapstick even, I'm not a fan. It's not terrible across the board and sometimes it manages to actually be funny, there's just too much that doesn't stick.The premise of the movie, that ""everything must be destroyed"" ultimately just felt unneeded to me, probably because the motivation behind it isn't really developed at all. This in turn also didn't help me to appreciate the main villain, who has no motivation or development either. I'm not even going to touch Hulk/Banner, they've been turned into a goof.Luckily, there's also a rather decent movie buried beneath all that if you can manage to overlook the rest. Thor: Ragnarok doesn't seem to take itself too serious, and that works in it's favor, as much as I hate to admit it. The acting is mostly very good and the CGI is top notch. The movie has some interesting locations and settings and all in all it still felt like an adventure to me that I didn't totally regret seeing. Yet, I still feel a little sad inside.Watch at your own risk."

She is incredibly powerful and malevolent and claims the throne to Asgard, killing anyone who opposes her. Thor and Loki accidentally end up on Sakaar, a planet run by the The Grandmaster, part-tyrant, part-ringmaster. Thor is imprisoned on the planet and forced to fight to the death against The Grandmaster's champion...the Hulk.Entertaining, and better than the average comic book movie. The reason for the elevated status is the humour and lightness injected by New Zealand director Taika Waititi, the man who directed the superb What We Do In the Shadows, as well as Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Eagle vs Shark. Rather than the usual boring CGI, action and nothing else this movie is quite funny, with some great one-liners (though Waititi generally reserves the best ones for himself, as Korg).Unfortunately, there is still the obligatory dose of comic book action, so it isn't all good, but overall it is a reasonably entertaining experience."
8 February 2020,kjdewau,5,11,2,Disney Just Cannot Make One Decent Movie,"And thinks every film, every character and every story is Toy Story.Disney has more to do with pukey Wal-mart's Made in China corona plastic section than with film, cinema or legends. They take Thor the God of Norse Thunder and make him forget which god he is, tell jokes, deliver one-liners and all the people of Valhalla are fooled by an impostor (all of them!) and are sitting around watching community drama.And here is the kicker: Disney's audience loooooves it and gives it 10/10. No wonder Trump is the president."
29 April 2018,Glue2Screen,1,2,9,"Funny, action packed and good one-liners BUT has disappointments","First my annoyance, I did not like the fast death and short focus of the Three Warriors. These three got barely any screen time and played no part in the storyline. As well, no lady Sif! Schedule or no schedule conflict with Jaime Alexander, Sif is a major part of Thor comic books and that she didn't even make an appearance garners much disappointment!Now the good: despite the writing off of some major characters, Thor Ragnarok did win in terms of action, storyline, comedic elements and great banter between characters. The part that kept me glued to the screen was the humor and banter. The action and CG, are as usual pretty good but the driving force, in my opinion, is the humor."
28 November 2017,bowmanblue,1,8,9,There is no justice in the film industry,"As little as ten years ago, if you were to ask the average film-goer which film they would think would be better out of the third instalment of a lesser known Marvel comic book star, aka Thor, or the first outing for DC's 'Justice League' featuring some of the biggest comic book names in superheroes ever created, ala Batman and Superman. I'm guessing most wouldn't ever have heard of a Norse god when compared to Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent. However, in late 2017 'Thor (part 3): Ragnarok' was released a few weeks before 'Justice League' and completely sunk all hope for Batman and co at setting the Box Office alight in terms of superhero-related movies.I know there's quite a heated debate between the Marvel and DC community, but I like to think of myself as one of the 'neutrals.' Batman is probably my favourite superhero, so I was hoping beyond hope that Justice League would live up to its potential. I even saw it before Thor: Ragnarok and thought it was pretty good. However, when I then went and watched Thor, I kind of realised why Justice League was flagging.I can think of a handful of 'elite; sequels that surpass the original, but they're the minority (Aliens, T2, Empire Strikes Back and so on), but I can't quite recall any third instalments that blow both predecessors completely out of the water. In short Thor: Ragnarok is epic. It feels like it's been given a much bigger budget and the freedom to really have some fun with the characters. I think it's the general consensus that it's the 'funniest' of all the Marvel cinematic universe films to date. It never really takes itself too seriously and is all the better for it. You really get the feeling that the cast were generally having a laugh while they were doing this. All the old faces you'd expect from the previous Thor outings return, i.e. Anthony Hopkins, Thor's mates (all of which names escape me right now!) and, most importantly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. It's kind of a thing that Marvel doesn't really know how to do its villains too well and most people feel that Loki has been the one and only highlight of the enemies the Avengers have had to face. Therefore, Ragnarok plays on this perfectly and beefs up his screen time even more than ever. That's not to say that Cate Blanchett isn't good too as 'Hela.' In fact, she actually has some decent lines and we may be witnessing the film with both the best and second best villains in at the same time!However, no matter how good the supporting case is, the film is called 'Thor' after all and it wouldn't be anything without Chris Hemsworth's (disgustingly perfect) shoulders to rest on. He has really settled into the character and his interaction bounces off characters new and old alike. There's only a small amount of new faces added to the film, but they feel like they've been there all along. And, without getting back into the Thor versus Justice League debate again, the fact that these new characters seem so easy to relate to compared to JL's characters who feel like they've been crowbarred in just to add to the 'hero-weight' – just shows how well-written Thor is.As much as I wanted to enjoy Justice League more, I just couldn't. Thor was simply too much fun, much more action-packed, wonderfully light-hearted and literally a more colourful film to watch. If I had to pick a fault I'd say that the CGI still looked a little fake in all of the newly-built worlds, but the fun you can have with this mammoth of a popcorn movie more than made up for that.I'm not saying that I haven't enjoyed Marvel's previous output, but I really hope they make more like this. Oh, and did I mention the electro music is awesome as well?"
6 November 2017,puneetj-61988,6,15,9,Best Thor Movie,"This has to be the best Thor movie made so far, Chris Hemsworth(Thor) with his chiseled physique looks very much like a Norse God, and Cate Blanchett(Hella) does a fine role as the main negative lead. Mark Ruffalo(Hulk) and Tom Hiddlestone(Loki) put in very impressive performances too. But the best part of the movie was the timing of everything, be it the comic dialogues, the action sequences or the amazing background music. At times you are left amazed with the movie and the little kid inside of you leaps out for more. The only downside for me was the final action sequence which I think did not justify the movie. Not a movie to be missed."
11 December 2018,CubsandCulture,1,6,6,Entertaining but not really a Thor movie,"I rather enjoyed watching this film. The quips are funny; the action suspenseful and the world very colorful. The cast is having a lot of fun and I did too while watching the film. However, the more I thought about the film the more annoyed I got at it. In the end it feels much more like the Guardians of the Galaxy movie than a Thor one.The MCU is always going to have some weird tonal clashes given that their various heroes are different genres; Thor 1 & 2 were really in the high fantasy-royal drama setting and Thor 3 isn't. It mostly a sci-fantasy with a huge dose of comedy. It isn't just comic relief but much of the film is built around telling jokes. Worse, many of Thor's quips feel very Stark-isque and how Thor is written in Ragnarok feels off. Compounding this problem is the ending of the film is utterly at odds with what before in stakes and consequences. The ending is too dark.Thor has never been that close to the Norse myths in the comics or films but I still couldn't get over Hel(a) being Loki's sister (!) or Fenrir being present and not eating umm the sun. I found something very off putting about turning Ragnarok into a cosmic joke and plot device.This film was just too funny."
2 November 2017,SAMTHEBESTEST,1,7,7,"Visually Spectacular, Grippy so does Best Thor Film till date.","THOR RAGNAROK REVIEW :The one thing i always liked about Thor series is that they never gave a long run time film, they always believed in keeping it short and grippy. Thor Ragnarok wins half race here, rest half is won by Terrific Visuals, Massy Writing and throughout tight screenplay. Film has a quick beginning and may be that's the point where film keeps you hooked and it remains same till the End. Doctor Strange's Cameo is Pleasing. The villain Hela is powerful and her back story is well written. Thor's ""Revenger"" team is Great, you see some more addition in Marvel's superheroes list. That anticipation of Hulk's entry worths the wait as he arrives with the bang. Climax is well crafted, every thing is used perfectly by Director. Background music is decent. Cinematography is Excellent. Visual Effects are so good that i declare this one the as the most Visually spectacular film of Thor Series. Editing is Brilliant, no chance to point a finger. Direction is Very Good, could have been better but when everything looks good i don't think it's fair to talk on minor mistakes of director. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is a Perfect Money Making entertainer from Marvel. Marvel just can't disappoint with a good Superhero film. If you're a Fan of Marvel's superheroes films then Thor Ragnarok is a MUST SEE for you. Classes and masses both will love it, especially mass lovers. No doubts, Film will be a huge success at box, get ready for Highest Grossing Thor Film. Go for this one and have a BLAST, i guarantee you will not be disappointed. 7/10* by me, i would have loved to give 8/10 but i think a massy film does not deserve that rating even if it's too good."
16 November 2017,dfranzen70,1,6,8,Delightful Marvel romp!,"Ragnarok, according to Norse mythology, is the destruction of the world. Armageddon! Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! In this movie, it's kind of like that, only it might also be a beginning. So zen. Whatever it means, Thor's third thrilling ride is a blast, with familiar and new characters zooming into view just long enough for us to pay a tiny bit of heed and move on. It's fast, not thickly plotted, and most importantly a lot of fun. More fun than The Dark World.Part of the reason is that Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth) smiles almost continuously throughout the movie. In previous Marvel films, Thor's been kind of serious, a more grounded counterweight to Tony Stark but not as angry as The Hulk. Here, he's both smart and giddy. And he has every reason to be giddy, because this is a fun movie, as so many Marvel films are.Thor returns to Asgard with the horns of some demon who's kind of important to the story, but he discovers that Heimdel (Idris Elba) has been accused of treason and is in exile, that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is using his powers of trickery to run things (including staging plays telling his tales of bravery), and that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is actually on Midgard (aka Earth). Oh, and that Odin's actual eldest child, Hela (Cate Blanchett) has now escaped her own prison – where Odin placed her when she got particularly rambunctious – and wishes to initiate Ragnarok. Death to everyone! Thor's adventures in trying to save Asgard land him on a remote planet, though, imprisoned to fight as a gladiator at the pleasure of the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who's equal parts hilarious and brutal. And who's the grand champion in the arena? Why, none other than The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)! Can Thor escape the Grandmaster, get back to Asgard, stop Ragnarok, defeat his older sister, and then drink some mead? Some of those, anyway! So why does this Thor work so well? Because it's HILARIOUS. It's less comic-book movie and more comedy. There's a buttload of comedy, which is a lot no matter how big of a butt we're talking about. Everyone is aces. Even Stan Lee (yes, of course he has a cameo). Director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) essentially subverts the superhero film, taking on tropes, clichés, you name it. It's not that Thor acts like an anti-hero (like Iron Man), it's that he appears to have fun saving the universe. It's a nice switch. And Thor: Ragnarok gleefully (and gracefully) sets up the next movie(s) in the endless franchise, so it's a virtually seamless fit into the vaunted Marvel Universe."
15 January 2022,maria-69176,2,4,9,Really fun with a good plot,The movies has many comical moments that are really funny. This movie has more humoristic moments than an average Marvel movie. And even though it´s really fun movie it still has some serious moments and great fighting scenes. I recommend this movie to people aged 8 and older.
7 December 2018,soulexpress,2,8,2,Marvel's BATMAN & ROBIN (and not in a good way),"I like that the Marvel films have a sense of humor, but who thought it was a good idea to lower Thor to the level of BATMAN & ROBIN? If the jokes had at least been funny, I might have made it to the end; but the jokes aren't funny, they're just stupid. That's why I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes and switched over to ""Black Mirror."""
10 April 2020,muzical-96828,4,12,4,wasn't looking for a comedy,This movie just plain sucked. Hulk was reduced to a dumbass with a hangover. The 1 liners just keep coming in this movie. Problem is I wanted to see a good story. I actually liked the first 2 Thor movies. WTF happened?? Why are superheroes all comedians now?
13 November 2017,noahlenzi,3,7,5,Very Average,"The Thor movies have always been somewhat of a disappointment to a majority of the Marvel fans but the reviews are in for Ragnarok and they call it amazing. I went in hoping for an endearing adventure and was left with a film that was very cut and dry with a mixed tone. To put it shortly, Thor: Ragnarok is not good, not bad, just fine.It had some laughs here and there but every time I thought it was going somewhere interesting it quickly delved away from it, especially with its villain. Cate Blanchett does her best to finally give us another good Marvel villain but she isn't given enough, there's a lot of interesting layers to peel with her and Thor but they are quickly ignored. The story follows the same pattern as it's the same Marvel formula of good versus evil which is not a bad thing, per se, it just doesn't bring anything new to the table. There's a lot of moments where we could question things about our heroes and have some internal conflict but instead we get character breaking jokes. There are a few emotional moments in the film that ultimately fall flat either due to the lack of build-up or are downplayed by jokes. Some of the jokes feel all too familiar or forced and don't land. Of course there are some good ones but the film really needed to have some confidence and take itself more seriously. I didn't feel anything as I watched this film, I just felt moderately entertained.It's fun for the most part and is in no way bad, just another Marvel film. The best part of this movie was Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum and that was great. The parts with Goldblum and some of the banter between characters during earlier action scenes where all the humor the film needed. The tone is off but the action is still strong so the best way I can put the film is that it's just a way to be entertained for two hours."
7 February 2018,Bored_Dragon,1,8,8,"""Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness, with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bulls-eyes.""","The most effective way to understand the difference between DC and Marvel movies is to look at Nolan's Batman and Thor: Ragnarok. From the beginning, Marvel spiced their superhero flicks with a touch of humor and light atmosphere, but here they have turned the game. So far it has been difficult to precisely determine the genre of Marvel's films, but this time there are no doubts. The new Thor is a comedy, action comedy, and one of the best Marvel films, side by side with Deadpool, Doctor Strange and Guardians, maybe even slightly better. Story itself breaks out of a superhero pattern, the characters are comical, and even those we've seen in the previous films got a relaxed and comical note, and the one-liners are hilarious. Comedy here is not just spice, like in the previous films, but from the beginning it strikes right into the head and does not stop to the end of the film, varying from light humor, through ""WTF?!"" and ""I can't believe what he just said/done,"" to the complete shame-transfer. When you discover that movie was directed by the creator of ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and that one of the main roles is played by Jeff Goldblum, everything becomes clear.8,5/10"
15 September 2019,nnddhhtt,4,9,6,I am not fan of Thor movies. This one is no exception.,"I don't know why the rating is high for this one. It is no better than the first two.
The storyline is nothing new but Thor's family fighting for throne. Writers tried the best to make you laugh with jokes. But most are stupid and not funny. Ant-Man and Venom are much more funny."
15 November 2017,tavm,1,12,8,Thor: Ragnarok was another awesome ride in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!,"All right, I've just seen Thor:Ragnarok with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it before and liked it and here's my verdict: It's awesome! I mean, the story of Thor and brother Loki and their just-revealed sister is aces plus the possibility of their losing their home planet of Asgard plus some other people and not to mention the return of a certain green-skinned creature...So that's a high recommendation of Thor: Ragnarok! Oh, and dig another cameo by a creator of these heroes..."
5 November 2017,Alexander_Blanchett,1,4,8,Like a comic strip,"This movie is a lot of fun and so far the best of the Thor franchise. When the first one felt like a knight's tale, the second one like a middle age epos the third one now is the pure SciFi version in the tradition of Guardians of the Galaxy. Chris Hemsworth used a lot of self irony for his portrayal even more so than in the past installments which was refreshing. Cate Blanchett was a solid villain and obviously loved playing that role. it was far from challenging as it was rather one dimensional (with an interesting back story tho) but she was fierce and loved it and that totally translated to the audience. Tom Hiddelston was good and sneaky as always. He really is the perfect choice for the role of Loki and once again proves that. Mark Ruffalo was solid enough with some new characteristics of his character. Same goes to Idris Elba who created his role as a runaway outcast. Karl Urban was fun but the greatest new addition is Jeff Goldblum. Just awesome. I really hope we will see some more of his character in future. Tessa Thompson was also great and truly ass kicking. Really liked her performance and character. Loved to see Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and it was a nice swan song for Anthony Hopkins. Taika Waiti was an inspired and probably brave choice for the director chair but it totally paid off. He created a wild, crazy and extremely colorful bag of fun that never loses its sense for self irony and is extremely playful with many superhero clichés. Great job. Great blockbuster. Great new entry for Marvel."
8 April 2018,patryxiahaggard-998-873727,3,4,3,Disappointing,"The jokes were terribly misplaced and it was a very sad attempt at comedy. I agree that Chris's ""comedic"" ability should be shown off but this wasn't the movie to for it. If it weren't for the fact that this was ""a key set-up to infinity wars"" I'd say it isn't even worth seeing which is upsetting because you've got a-list actors and actresses on this movie. I blame this all on bad directing, the story line is good, the actors are great, the set wasn't too bad... it's the sad attempt at being funny. If this movie doesn't kill the Thor series please change directors."

3 April 2018,gradyharp,1,11,5,'A creepy old man cut my hair off!',"Another THOR movie, this one written by a cadre of 6 and directed by Taika Waititi and a few added movie stars, this time some humor, and a lot of CGI and the taste is about the same.Story (what there is of it) - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), held captive on the planet Sakaar without his hammer, must win a gladiatorial duel against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and assemble a team (made up of Hulk (Ruffalo), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Thor (Hemsworth), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop the villainous Hela (Cate Blanchett) and the impending Ragnarök, the doom of the Asgardian civilization. New characters pop in and out - Skurge (Karl Urban), Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Surtur (Clancy Brown), and of course Heimdall (Idris Elba), and Odin (Anthony Hopkins). BTW, Ragnarök is not a character, just the doom of the Asgardian civilization - in case you're wondering.Does it make sense? Of course not, but then this is a comic book.... If THOR is your thing you'll have a grand time - if you can see through all the aether and other CGI clutter."

2 November 2017,rgkarim,1,6,8,God Of Thunderous Applause and Comedy,"He's big, he's flashy, and he has locks of hair and a body that slays many. Yes, he's Marvel's own Thor, and tonight is his third solo movie's release date. In hopes of smashing the box office, Disney has brought the God of Thunder back with a darker twist in hopes of reigniting the magic of Marvel. Welcome to Robbie K's movie reviews and tonight we analyze, observe, and share my opinions on yet another movie to hit the silver screen. Let's get started!LIKES:Special effects: Disney's team is the master of money, which entitles them to deliver a dazzling display of cinematography magic. Thor Ragnarok is another example of how the Marvel universe can be brought to life. Dazzling special effects fill the big screen in the form of nature's wrath, flying projectiles, and monsters of various designs. While certainly not the most realistic of the graphics, Disney's group crafted fluid animation, colorful spectacles, and of plenty of speaker blowing sound effects to go with it. If that's not enough of a selling point, then how about the special effects of Chris Hemsworth's body will be happy to please the eyes of many female fans, plenty of shots according to my friends tonight. Action: Remember the first Thor where there wasn't much battling, but more babysitting? Yeah, well the Thor group managed to take the action of the avengers, and kind of cram it into this movie. Ragnarok, spares no time diving into the action, and keeps it spread throughout the entire 130-minute run time. The darker themes of the story certainly allowed this, and thank goodness, the directors took hold of the opportunity. While Thor certainly gets more of the seat gripping battle scenes, this movie provides the other cast some rather impressive scenes. And finally, Marvel has broken the cycle of lame villains, giving Hela (Cate Blanchett) some bite instead of just barking. With all these contenders and the edginess of the movie, you can rest assured that the dullness of Thor has been broken. Comedy: By far though, Thor Ragnarok's biggest selling point is comedy the series is so famous for. The third installment is perhaps the funniest of the bunch, trading whiny complaints of assistants and naked walks by old professors Instead, the writers decided to fill the movie with a lot of diverse comedic ploys to keep the chuckles coming. Slapstick humor, well-delivered one-liners, wacky catchphrases, sarcasm, and banter to no limits. Ragnarok has all this in fantastic amounts to keep the movie as fun and entertaining as possible. Even better, is how the comedy is also integrated into the action scenes, showing that the writers in Marvel haven't lost their talent after all. The music itself is also funny comedic relief, sounding like something out of an 80's video game, in all its dazzling, electric keyboard glory. DISLIKES:Missing Character Stories: Ragnarok has a lot of good with it, but one thing that was slightly annoying was how some of the characters lacked complete background information. Valkyrie in particular was a little rushed, leaving out some key things that could have made her an even deeper character. Even Hela herself has a rather shallow story, glazing over what could have been some cool sequences for some overdramatic banter about how hurt she was. Outside of Thor and Loki (who have had movies to weave their tale), the backup characters seemed slightly diluted in the grand scheme of the movie. Over-hyped Action: Don't get me wrong, Thor had plenty of excitement to amp up the pace and excitement of the movie. Unfortunately, the sequences are rather short-lived, or more comedic than actually exciting. With the bar set high for me, I was hoping that the scenes were going to be more intense, filled to the brim with fist punching, lightning throwing, and sword wielding incredibleness. And just as the momentum was building, they dropped it for more comedy and banter between Thor and some other character. This particular scenario was especially true for Hulk Vs. Thor, which while entertaining, was disappointing on the exciting action part. While the conclusion managed to build up my hope, it too didn't have quite the zing I had hoped. Despite all this though, I still enjoyed the action. The VERDICT:Truth is, Thor Ragnarok, while being dark, is one of the more entertaining films of the bunch on so many levels. It's got a fast pace to keep things going, action to liven up the scenes, a villain who doesn't entirely stink, and comedy to keep the dialogue fun as well. If you're like me you will be laughing almost the entire movie, but if you are ones preferring over the top slapstick and innuendos out the wazoo, then slow your roll for this movie. While I would have loved to see more character development (and use) of the secondary characters and a little more excitement in battles, truth is this is one of the better Marvel films in a while. And of course, with all the special effects, this reviewer can't help, but recommend you see this movie in theaters. Beware thoughthis movie is a little more inappropriate for younger audience members not only due to the more adult comedy, but also for the language used in this film. Exercise caution please when choosing this film, and plan a babysitter if you don't want little ears hearing course dialogue. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5"
4 June 2018,BiiivAL,20,153,8,«No Hammer. No Problem »,"Every year, with bated breath and absorbing one trailer after another, a huge audience of Marvel fans waiting for movies within their beloved universe. The cinematic world created by Marvel Studios will very soon celebrate its decade and for such a long time, directors from the camp of the ""reds"" managed to create a lot of bright, inspirational and truly steep bands about superheroes.While the competitors are trying to keep up with the MCU, the creators of the Marvel universe from the world of cinema - roared to its fullest. Space budgets that allow you to attract great actors and show incredible beauty special effects - the best motivation for the creator, allowing you to unfold ""in full"" from a professional point of view. Nothing distracts the directors of Marvel from the main thing, the work. They completely give themselves to their projects, from that and watch them a pleasure.""Thor: Ragnarok"" was no exception. Moreover, the third part about the adventures of God of Scandinavian mythology can rightly be called the most ingenious film MCU. Why? Let's try to understand with you, once again chanting the thankful tirade Marvel for a similar approach to filmmaking.The director of the third ""solo"" film about the Torah was the New Zealand comedy director, a man who was not deprived of a sense of humor, 42-year-old Taika Vaitichi (""Real Ghouls."") Tyka, of course, did not have experience in producing blockbusters and shot mostly low-budget comedy dramas. But, as we know, for the Marvel bosses, long ago, not an indicator of ""experience and payback."" For the ""Red Bosses"", as we saw in the example of Favreau and Gunn, the main thing is excitement and ""fire"" in the eyes of the creator. caught fire ""to put the film, then his own, giving himself up to work completely, then he is an ideal candidate for a director's chair.If you compare solo films about the Torah with solo ribbons about other heroes of Marvel, then Goldilocks clearly ""loses"" to colleagues on all fronts. Too serious were the films about the hero Chris Hemsworth, devoid of superhero gloss ... Like a dry breakfast from a company that you do not like - yes, at times tasty, but not at all. And the fault in this was both the studio and the directors, which this studio assigned. The first film about the Torah was staged by Cannes laureate, who was shooting dry dramas, and the second tape was filmed by a serial director who worked on classy multiseries (""Sopranos"", ""Rome""), but having no idea what and how works in a big movie From the appointment of Taiki to the post, from the very beginning it looked like a cry of the soul of the MCU bosses - if he does not cope, then no one will cope.First of all, the third film about the Torah completely changed its positioning. Down with the fresh supply of Scandinavian mythology to the comic! Now the ball is ruled by humor! And not just stupid jokes inappropriately, but ingenious, bursting typical Marvel banter patterns, riveting to the screen from the first minutes of viewing. Over the years, each of us has become accustomed to the typical construction of films of a superhero genre ... A skeleton over which history is built up. So Taika and his team, not giving a damn about the ""canons"" and ""covenants"", lit up to the full, deriding the scheme used by ""fellow workers"" from year to year.""Mjolnir"" The Torah can only hold a decent one, and it is forged from a dying star, which gives the hammer an incredible striking force? Turn it into dust for the first ten minutes of the timing! And there are many such moments in the film. To laugh will have to be loud and long, from scene to scene, from dialogue to dialogue.In addition to good humor, the film features wildly powerful female characters. No, not as sleek, like a Wonder Woman getting up to his full height of the trench, inspiring frightened to death of men ... And the real, live, as far as possible within the comics. For them, there is not enough pathetic-fresh nonsense that poured into the ears of the characters of the previous films. From now on they need motivation to risk their lives. Now they will not go into hell after the phrase ""We need to save Asgard!"", It's not enough for them. They need to be persuaded, to gain confidence with their leadership qualities and only then ask for help. And even after that, it's completely ""not a fact"" that they will agree.A separate line of praise for the third film about the Torah, I want to mention the inimitable Jeff Goldyublum in the image of Grandmaster. The character of Jeff, a dictator in miniature, running a planet-dump, where gladiatorial fights predominate. He disposes of lives like a ringing coin in his pocket, ""squandering"" her for his own pleasure. Emancipated, charismatic and incredibly attractive character. I sincerely hope that one day we will see this hero, performed by Jeff and the Collector from the ""Guardians"", performed by Benicio Del Toro. Why not? In comic books these two are best friends!The result. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a film that gives a vivid understanding of how much the ""standard"" molding schemes of the Marvel Studios are molded. Taika Vaitichi, through the prism of humor and ridicule, hints: ""It's time to change the positioning."" Hell, even if James Gunn acknowledged this by comparing the ""Torah"" with the ""magical cassette from the 80's"", what are the other MCU directors waiting for? The time of serious people is gone, Marvel.Continue in the same spirit, beat on all the strings at the same time!""Father, she destroyed the hammer ...""

It was really fun, yeah it actually was. The action sequences were totally epic. The length was pretty good, for such a movie. All of that made Thor: Ragnarok away to be a decent MCU movie!"
19 November 2017,dallmayrsadyba,5,8,1,I do not recommend,"Is this action movie or parody? Really bad, bad movie, too much of shallow humor. Even movies with Jim Carrey did not try to be so funny. But on the other hand what to expect from Disney? All their superhero movies are like this. After the jump on the bridge Bruce looked quite dead ...I do not recommend unless you like silly movies."
7 February 2018,Nathiri,3,7,8,A humourous armageddon.,"I consider a rating of 7 to be a good watchable movie, but it has some flaws. The big flaw is how humourous many of the scenes are. While this does make the movie quite enjoyable for the most part, it also, breaks immersion. I do like humour in almost all films to make it an enjoyable experience and to encourage re-watchabilty; but I dont like movies of this type to be overly satirical. The Avengers and Captain America have humour, but is still serious, and immersive. The scene at the very beginning is very over the top to express this type of comedic humour, and while it does provoke a few laughs, it is too silly to include in this type of film.Another annoyance is the occasional choice of music that breaks immersion too. The concluding battle includes this, and this only detracts from the film and its setting. This gives even more the feeling of comedy, which is not what these stories are usually about, and shouldnt be about.Is this movie enjoyable however? Very much so. While I did have issues with the above, many of the comedy scenes I did laugh at, and most I was okay with; just some were too over the top/silly, and detracted from the nature of the film; and so it would not be included on the very top of my Marvel movie list, as it misses the mark in a couple places for me. In the end, if you want an enjoyable and very funny movie with some violence, then this movie would be up your alley."
16 February 2018,ruhsa,7,26,9,Amazing Movie ( Thoroughly Enjoyable ),"This movie shows something I've never seen . It's amazing for its plot setting, pace, visual effect, music etc. Thor Ragnarok managed to bring the essence of Marvel after a few years. Film is very well written, has amazing graphics and impresses in the narrative. Hulk works great the hero is in your best shape and performance since the Avengers (2012), who had an excellent performance and left the film even more complete. Cate Blanchett (Hela) has an impeccable performance to me she was a great villain of the Marvel movies, your character really scary. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) still has a great chemistry on screen that has been creating over the time together really work well and makes the story even more fluid. Marvel hit movie and managed to overcome other great long as, Avengers (2012) and Civil War (2016).Most enjoyable movie for me.Thanks for giving me joy marvel.I really needed it . My rating is 9/10 ."

It is truly rare that the second or third movie outdoes the first one but this one really did. After the second Thor movie, I was concerned, but Thor Ragnarok definitely redeemed and saved the Thor franchise. I even liked this one more than the first one. It was great that they changed the vibe and tone of the Thor movies with this one because the cast like Chris H himself is very comedic and it's perfect for his character and the movie to be funny. Taika Waititi did amazing."

                        ",A lot of fun!,"I really had no high expectations for this. I had never seen the first two Thor films and, according to the general consensus, I had not actually missed much. What was great about this is that I absolutely did not have to watch the first two films to get where the characters were at. It almost seemed like the filmmaker wants to erase what had been in the past and start from scratch, and luckily they did a mighty fine job of it. This is funny and wickedly entertaining, and most importantly, Thor is a great character to watch. Chris Hemsworth infuses him with so much natural charisma that the entire thing works. He has always seemed like he would make a great character, and here he finally becomes one."
21 April 2018,MichaelMRamey,1,3,7,The Best Of The Three Thor Films,"It's not often that a sequel outshines the original, but Ragnorak is Thor's best leading film. It feel much more lively, fun and comic book-esq. familiar faces and stand out new characters work together to create this visually stunning and solid story film that leads into Infinity War. Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth surprisingly work well as an onscreen duo."
12 March 2019,molagbal-40466,4,8,10,Super awesome,This movie represented Thor's character the best. He was completely bland in the first two movies and Age of Ultron. The plot is also stronger than the first two movies
2 November 2017,tsroque,3,11,10,LOVED This Movie!,"This was a fun and exciting movie to watch. I was fearful that it would end up that the 3rd Iron Man movie, but everything about it was entertaining. The jokes were plenty and the director didn't drag them out beyond an awkward moment. Action scenes were very well planned and thought out as well. HIGHLY recommend this movie! Best Marvel movie I've seen! LADIES...you WILL enjoy this movie! ;)"
9 November 2017,tomgillespie2002,1,9,8,Thor's Winter Soldier,"One of the fairest criticisms aimed at Marvel's now 9 years in-the- making Cinematic Universe is that mastermind Kevin Fiege has worked out the perfect superhero blockbuster formula and has stuck with it. It's a cookie-cutter approach, so much so that entries like Iron Man, Ant- Man and Doctor Strange seem almost indistinguishable on paper. The MCU has now raked in over $13 billion at the box-office, so it's clearly doing something right. But recently, Marvel have deliberately selected directors capable of leaving their fingerprints, such as Ryan Coogler being handed the task of tackling the Africa-set Black Panther (due next year), and Kiwi filmmaker Taika Waititi - a choice met with both confusion and sheer excitement on its announcement - to handle the Norse apocalypse. Although I enjoyed 2011's Thor for all its Shakespearian campiness, 2013's sequel The Dark World was mediocre at best, and the God of Thunder was in major need of a kick up the arse.In fact, the sight of 'the strongest Avenger' receiving a boot up the backside wouldn't look out of place in Waititi's bright, 80's- inspired cosmic wet-dream. Marvel's have always peppered the heroics with humour and sight gags, but Thor: Ragnarok represents the first time they have opted for full-blown comedy with an occasional action scene in between. Waititi was clearly hired for this very reason, and anybody who fell in love with vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows and last year's surprisingly touching Hunt for the Wilderpeople will find plenty of laughs here. The director's goofy, playful sense of humour can be found all over Ragnarok, and anybody concerned that this will be to the detriment of taking the film's end-of-the-world premise seriously can be rest assured. Characters are offed or mutilated without pausing for breath, and the climax changes the universe of the MCU forever. The good guys also face their most formidable threat yet, the Goddess of Death herself, Hela (a striking Cate Blanchett).We first meet up with Chris Hemsworth's Thor as he lies chained-up and imprisoned by fire demon Surtur, after having spent the last two years travelling the cosmos searching for those pesky Infinity Stones. When he finally arrives home, he finds his mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) posing as their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), allowing Asgard's many enemies to gain more power as a result. They travel to Earth and, with the help of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), locate their father, who is apparently waiting to die in Norway. He warns his sons that Ragnarok is coming, as is their sister Hela. After a skirmish that sees the hammer Mjolnir destroyed, Thor is blown into space and lands of Sakaar, where most of the universe's garbage ends up. He is captured by scrapper Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is forced to become a gladiator for the amusement of the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Here he meets his old friend Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who has been in Hulk form for the past two years and clearly enjoying his life as a celebrity warrior.Waititi promised a buddy road-trip through the cosmos and that is exactly what we get. Hemsworth has always had a gift for comedy and he is given free reign here, with the bulk of the dialogue made up of improvisation. Ragnarok is truly daft and care-free, even finding the time to squeeze in jokes about masturbation and a wormhole called 'The Devil's Anus'. The director himself also shines on camera as well as behind it, lending his voice to the gently-spoken rock monster Korg, who steals every scene he is in. There are weaknesses: Not all the jokes land, and Blanchett's Hela comes across as a one-note distraction from the events on Sakaar, where Thor, Loki, Valkyrie, Banner and a Jeff Goldblum at his most Goldbumiest are having a much better time. But when Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song kicks in near the end, you'll be too busy punching the air to care about such flaws. Very much like how The Winter Soldier finally nailed Captain America after a stumbling start, Ragnarok elevates Thor from the runt of the litter to one of the leaders of the pack, reminding us just why he's called the God of Thunder."
24 July 2018,bryangary65,1,4,7,Thor is not ..Corr,"All pretty silly, and aimed at a teenage audience Acting is pretty poor from the star names as they ham their roles up. However thought Cate Blanchett as the baddie was convincing enough It's entertaining I suppose if you let your brain cells have a couple of hours off, though think the CGI looked liked it was CGI!"
9 March 2019,satriaridho,3,5,9,Fun and Cool,"Thor is very different here , the story and the character is almost perfect to me , and this is one of the best marvel movie in my opinion !"
3 November 2017,ThomasDrufke,1,12,9,The MCU is Back to Feeling Fresh,"I've defended the Thor franchise for being 2 of the more fun and innocent MCU films, and I mean innocent because nothing of major consequence really happens in either. Yes, Loki does take over Odin's seat in Thor: The Dark World, but other than that, they are relatively harmless and forgettable narratives. While Ragnarok doesn't shake up the MCU to the point that Captain America: Civil War did last year, it does however bring some of the funniest moments and greatest action to date.I'm glad that this isn't titled Thor 3: Ragnarok because it doesn't feel like a sequel to either Thor film at all. In fact, the only character(s) returning of any significance are Thor, Loki, Heimdall, and Odin. And you quickly realize that this film isn't trying to honor any story threads that happened in previous Thor outings. Luckily, Taika Waititi brings an entirely new direction to the fading MCU creativity. I don't wish to bring up the lack of originality in Spider-Man Homecoming, Guardians 2, or Doctor Strange, because they're essentially retreads of tired Marvel stories. But Ragnarok feels stylistically and thematically different from anything in the MCU to date. Of course, there are some frustrating aspects, but it's nothing that kills the movie for me.Continuing with the long list of great actors who don't really get a chance to shine as MCU villains, Cate Blanchett plays Hela, the goddess of death, who wants to bring the end of Asgard as we know it. Blanchett, much like Michael Keaton in this summer's Spider-Man, gives a serviceable performance and definitely feels distinct from previous villains, but ultimately is pushed to the side for developing the heroes more. It doesn't surprise me one bit, but I still can't help but feel a little let down we didn't get to see the 2 time Oscar winner shine a little more.The one thing I have been criticizing Marvel for the most of late is the humor. It's one thing when we get occasional quippy humor from Tony Stark or maybe some physical humor at the hands of Hulk & Loki, but the last few MCU films have just felt like punchline after punchline and I'm just getting tired of it. But for some reason, the humor works remarkably well with Ragnarok. It felt to me like Taika let us decide whether or not we should be laughing, whereas James Gunn and Guardians 2 basically shoved every joke down or throats several times over. I can't particularly put my finger on why Thor's humor worked so well, but it did, and it's gosh darn so flipping fun.The entire cast does a great job of presenting Taika's humor and direction to its fullest potential. Mark Ruffalo further proves why people want a Hulk standalone movie so bad, and is as good as he's ever been in Ragnarok. Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie, a vicious and snarky bada** who joins Thor on the epic adventure. Idris Elba, Anthony Hopkins, and Benedict Cumberbatch reprise their previous MCU roles and all enhance the scenes they are in. And of course, Tom Hiddleston as Loki is still just as frustratingly charming as he was 6 years ago when he first debuted.The action is breathtaking (including one of the best openings to an MCU), the humor is outrageously amusing, and Taika's direction is exactly the jolt of energy the universe needed. Thor Ragnarok puts the MCU back on track.9.0/10"

9 November 2017,ericstevenson,1,12,10,"My 1,000th review!","After years (or at least close to that time) of being on this website writing reviews, I am very happy to say that this is my one thousandth review! I knew I had to do something special for such a monumental occasion and I did so by reviewing the most critically acclaimed movie of the year! This is the best ""Thor"" movie and the most recent in one of the best years for superhero movies ever! We've been going through nothing but hits this year! Okay okay, back to the movie. This film features Thor and Loki going back to Asgard to fight Thor's evil sister, Hela. Honestly, that's mostly the whole plot.It doesn't mean we can't have a great time with this modern classic! Every other Marvel movie featured all the Avengers together or just one of them but this one actually has two of them, Thor and the Hulk! It's easily the best Hulk movie. The best part about the movie is how beautiful it looks. I mean, it seems like every image of this film shows off gorgeous colors and lush environments. We got tons of zany stuff happening and there's never a dull moment here. We get tons of great jokes in the process too.I laughed out loud when they mentioned Thor turning into a frog. Yes, that was an actual thing that happened in the comics. My only complaint is that they got rid of the Natalie Portman character and I really liked that couple! I admit that I'm kind of indifferent to Jeff Goldblum but he was wonderfully entertaining in this as was everyone else. I feel bad for not reading Thor comics because I don't recognize any of these new characters. I assume they're from the comics at least. It's this reason why I love film so much and why I've written a thousand reviews here! ****"
16 December 2018,vivianwu-32929,3,5,9,Must watch of the MCU!,"The Thor franchise has been largely forgettable, remembered mostly because of his upstaging brother Loki and his love interest, Dr. Jane Foster. Thor considers himself to be the ""strongest avenger."" Although given his image in Thor (2011), and Thor: the Dark World (2013), he should be the ""most boring avenger.""When Thor: Ragnarok hit the theaters, I had my doubts. Now they have disappeared. The third installment of the Thor series is absolutely fantastic.Director Taika Waititi reinvented this movie from the previous tediousness into a silly and joyous comedy. Despite the Asgard-ending catastrophic event that the title promised, it's filled with a cheerful atmosphere and packed with jokes.The story is set two years after the Battle of Sokovia (Avengers 2.) Thor finds himself imprisoned on the alien planet of Sakaar. In order to get back to Asgard to save it from Hela, his half-sister, and the impending Ragnarok, he finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against Hulk.Marvel has already announced that Thor: Ragnarok will be the last installment of the Thor franchise. To give this franchise the ending that it deserves, they added new characters. Like the Grandmaster, portrayed by Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett as Hela, the one that has shattered Thor's hammer, and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. Together, they made Thor: Ragnarok grand.However, Thor: Ragnorak does have its flaws. The transitions between the scenes of Asgard and Sakaar is too abrupt. Also, I would have liked it much more if the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki was explored deeper (It's been three films!). It was completely covered by humor.I strongly recommend you to go watch Thor: Ragnarok. It is an amazing movie that will make you laugh heartily."
29 July 2018,elizabeth-12994,1,2,9,Hilarious,"Yes, the storyline wasn't necessarily weak but not a typical marvel film as it was more of a movie just for a laugh! It was such a funny film where almost every single joke made me laugh. It was such a feel good movie and I loved it. It's definitely a great film if you are up for a laugh. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchet and Mark Ruffalo were brilliant in particular. Especially Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth.

They love it as a goofball comedy! I guess these people were looking for an Adam Sandler film (vomit). I am not sure why they started watching an action/super hero/mythology film!!There is good news for Thor though: if Marvel releasing 50 films a year ends up killing the whole cinema system and people wake up and dump these stupid serial films he can always become a stand-up comedian."
13 November 2017,Zingbot_9000,2,7,10,I really enjoyed this movie,"Personally, I felt the other Thor movies were too dark and too boring. I was somewhat hesitant to see this, but the commercials lured me in. This one reminded me more of the Guardians of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. It was funny and very colorful. Chris Hemsworth is a funny guy- he has shown this in other projects. Here they decided to make use of it while having lots of action. This movie was Avengers meets Guardians. There is a team of ""Avenger"" type characters here also. While viewing movie I found myself smiling throughout. Just a fun popcorn movie. If you like the other Avenger movies and don't need a straight from the comic lift definitely go see this and Enjoy."
7 March 2018,arqjobmendes,5,10,2,Thor-ture,"Jokes and jokes and more jokes. From the first to the last minute.
This movie is a comedy, a mix of Monty Python and Deadpool/Guardians of the Galaxy. And none of this matches Thor's universe (at least in the comic book universe).
I do not understand why so many people liked it so much. Surtur and Hella...they were ridiculed and demoralized, so the question is: why? All the characters looked like Tony Stark clones, in the matter of excessive and unnecessary humor.
A giant waste of time and oppotunities, indeed.
Note 2 was motivated only by the soundtrack (Led Zeppelin, of course). Otherwise I would score 1."
7 June 2018,sagrat,2,4,2,Ragnarock Flushes the Asgardian toilet!,"Wow! I love Thor ... have done so since I was a teenager. I appreciate humor : have been a huge fan of :""Faulty Towers"" , ""Mr Bean"", ""Cheers"" , ""Murphy Brown"" and others. 
This was, as so many others noted, Thor Meet Guardians of the Galaxy"".
The humor is not funny .... sure, some moments had me laugh, but most of the laughs were of the pitying kind...... just lame jabs and really cheesy one-liners that wouldn't have made it to the screen of ""Mork & Mindy"" or ""Family Ties"" or even ""Home Improvements"". It takes REAL skill and talent, like that of Johnny Carson, to make bad jokes work.
This film didn't.
Even the VERY cliched use of Cate Blanchett .... what a supreme waste of talent! .... she was nothing more than a Sauron-ized version of Galadriel in this.
Even the CGI ... so very cheezy! The worst was the iconized Odin and the even worse Gladiator sequence between Thor and The Hulk.
It seemed to me that this director - or was it someone else's fault?? - simply stole the best bit from numerous other superbly done classics and hashed them together in this hot mess.
Sorry, but A Major Disappointment ..... I will not longer continue with the Star Trek reboot, the latest Star Wars and now Thor. This is what you get from a generation which has no roots in the classics - American, English and World - and who can't even manage cursive writing because it ""is a waste of time""! 
This film, sadly is a waste of time.
The only bigger waste of time I can envision is sitting through the 'new' version of ""A Star is Born"" due out later this year. A Rhodes scholar and the most amazing vocal and creative talent of the 20th Century are cookie-cutted by an excruciatingly 2-D offering. Barbra Streisand had the chops to step into the shoes of Judy Garland and create an enervating NEW and fresh version of a Hollywood classic. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga only manage to pull off what was offered here in ""Thor: Ragarok"" .... a pale, insipid and very weak imitation of Hollywood ART - I am not even going to hope for sublime. Passable even. 
Mediocre would be a high bar ..... sorry folks. The actors are only able to do so much when the director is a tool.."

4 November 2017,rockman182,1,6,8,Thor: Ragnarok (2017),"Admittedly, I'm not really a fan of the Thor films. I like Chris Hemsworth as Thor and an Avenger, but the films never drew my interest. Trailers for this looked good as it seemed to be more concerned with an adventurous and humorous time. Which is why Taika Waititi coming on board was a good move. What We Do in the Shadows is absolutely hilarious, and him in the MCU could have provided fun for a franchise that didn't have much of it previously. All in all, I've got to say this film is such a good time.This film takes place after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron and around the same time as Captain America: Civil War. Asgard is under siege by a new threat, a menacing and powerful sibling of Thor named Hela. Along the way Thor is enslaved on a planet where gladiator type battles occur and he tries to get Hulk and a bounty hunter named Valkyrie to band with him to save Asgard. Oh yeah, and we've got more Thor and Loki goodness too.The film actually looks gorgeous in the theaters. The scenes with Asgard especially. The choreographed fights are all excellent. The soundtrack (with Led Zeppelin's thunderous Immigrant Song) make the action a sonic and visual feat. The film is so much fun. There are jokes everywhere, many at the expense of Thor himself. It all works though. These films are ridiculous, and we should be able to laugh at it more often. Its probably the most light hearted entry in the MCU yet. Its probably the most re-watchable entry in this Universe because of that.Character development is quite sufficient at all ends. Thor is hammerless without most of the film but taps the inspiration of Odin to enable his true godly power. Loki is still conniving and narcissistic but you can't help but love it. Hulk isn't one of my favorite Avengers but even he is a welcome part of all the screen time he gets. Cate Blanchett is obviously a phenomenal actress but I was quite curious to see her in a superhero film. She's absolutely great. One of the most memorable villains in the MCU.Let's also not forget Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster. The film fires at all fronts. It's miles and away the best Thor film made, and gives Captain America: Civil War a real run for its money. Ragnarok has vastly now improved the Thor films which is what I was hoping for. Phase 3 is in full swing going into Infinity War. There are so many elements and heroes in this Marvel Universe but I'm excited to see what can be don with it all.8.5/10"

The second one was ok, but a step backwards, and to be honest I can barely remember it. This was a huge step up from part 2, and a lot of fun to boot, setting up the continued Avengers as well. Yes, it was partly a Planet Hulk movie, and I loved that part of it, yet having read that awesome comic, I would have liked a lot more of that.

Right from the start, you chuckle with all the gags and it's clear that the movie is playing itself for laughs for the most part. But, and this is the key factor in the movie, when things are serious, the movie is completely serious and poignant. This creates a consistent and really marvelous cinematic experience, and the best part, it's for all the family to see. As a really good superheroes movies really should be. Superheroes movies, at heart, are about fun, doing the right thing and having good times. The movie has been lauded by all the critics and spectators, and really deserves all the praise. A movie experience completely recommended. Perhaps the finest effort so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and gives hope to continue in this trend, and I hope all the other ""cinematic universes"" take this lesson at heart: it's not about the shared story, it's about the characters, the adventure and, specially, the fun.10/10, completely."
13 April 2019,samuelwha,4,11,10,So Funny!!!,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to say that this film an absolute snack! It is soooooo funny! I laughed so much, every joke is so good. I really liked how they did Thor in this movie! He was sooo funny! And no spoilers but there was a couple other characters (including a big green one wink wink) that were also really funny in all of their scenes! I wish every marvel movie was as good and funny as this one. It's a riot! See it ASAP!"

                        ","Asgard isn't a place, it is a people. Thor must save it against sister Hela.","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It is yet another action movie that gives the powered subwoofer a great workout.In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water.The IMDb summary does a good job so I won't repeat any of in in this short review. What I like most about this movie is the entertainment value. As viewers we know this is all fantasy, a movie like this should not take itself too seriously. This one is funny and absurd at times within its fictional universe. Even Stan Lee, with his usual 'cameo', actually plays a character that gives Thor an unwanted haircut. There is even an uncredited 'cameo' by Matt Damon, playing the part of Loki in a stage play being presented to Odin.A movie like this must use lots of CG and most of it looks really good. Good, entertaining movie. But who is Taylor Hemsworth who has a very short appearance as the Earth girl who wants to take a selfie with Thor?"
9 December 2019,NicholasLopez1,3,7,5,Just a bad movie,"The two earlier Thor films had a more ""godlike"" tone to them. Why not keep that and use it with the third one? This is a huge downgrade for Thor."
24 January 2018,loopinthoughts,2,4,6,"Just what you'd exist from the trailer, No more, No less!","It was a quality marvel movie with all its comedic elements in place. I felt the story lacked substance. Fell flat on its belly couple of times which i can't help but notice. The monster designs, fighting style, world design, actor performances were all good. But i personally craved and wished they went a bit deep into the storyline. Maybe i didn't wanted every marvel movie transform into a sequel for guardians of the galaxy. I enjoyed the humor, but i needed to learn more about their history. Well it's possible marvel prepped it all for the next thor movie in line, so we gonna have to wait i guess. Thus my 6/10 rating that connotes the movie was indeed a good watch but not perfect in some aspect."
23 January 2022,tloader-1,2,8,9,A nice change from the superhero norm,"Surprised at so many negative reviews here, this is easily the best of the Thor movies so far! The stale Thor storylines needed something new and exciting and this movie delivered.While still interweaving a story that fit into the universe as a whole and the Asgard mythology, they injected comedy and more focussed action, and the movie is much better because of it.I can understand why people would not be a fan of something new for a character they've loved for a long time, but this film shows why Marvel is still releasing successful and entertaining movies that are grounded with good stories."
19 March 2021,Kdosda_Hegen,1,11,5,This film isn't too bad.,"In fact, it's somewhat decent. CGI action isn't impactful at all and the humor is dreadful, but the storyline is pretty great and music was well fit in. One of the better MCU movies."
23 October 2018,ihor-62742,4,12,5,Sucks,Very happy end of the world. It is more C category trash than marvel movie
30 October 2017,joaomcg,6,17,6,Above average action flick for children,"Good action flick with mediocre script. All characters behave like 8 year old's (especially the Tessa character, she's so god damn annoying). Other than the script written for 10 year old's, the battles are indeed epic. But the script is average/bad at times, so this is not at all the same level as Logan or Guardians of the Galaxy."
22 March 2019,nirome,2,6,9,MCU wild ride,"Not only is this probably one the best MCU entries to date, but it's a wacky and colorful spectacle, the likes of which, we haven't seen since the days of Flash Gordon. It doesn't reach the levels of campyness that Flash Gordon achieved, but it sure retains its wackiness and eye-candy elements. Production and costume design on this one are the main focus and a casting array that seem to be having the time of their lives (Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett seem to be having a blast). Many hard-core fans may be upset by the many twist and turns that the movie takes and the humorous take on many of the elements and characters of the movie (Chris Hemsworth's capacity for making fun of himself is something that's been a constant of late in almost all of his movies and a very well received one), but it's something this movie excels on and what makes it, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy entries, one of the best exponents of the Marvel Cosmic Universe, which is slightly different to the Marvel Cinematographic Universe. Go watch it with no preconceived ideas of what a Superhero movie should look like and you'll thoroughly enjoy it. Great fun."
20 March 2018,Mr-Fusion,0,5,6,Well-intentioned,"I've never considered myself much of a Led Zeppelin fan, but the combination of ""Immigrant Song"" and the sight of Thor doing battle with a fire demon is shockingly entertaining. It's the reason why I was hooked by the film's opening. But it didn't take long for ""Ragnarok"" to settle into your standard Marvel sitcom, and that was hugely disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of fun moving pieces to this movie:  - Cate Blanchett vamping up the villainy
 - Goldblum playing the hell out of Goldblum
 - The funny rock guy
 - All of the Viking and heavy metal aesthetics
 - The '80s synth scoreBut with all effort to jazz up the most boring Avenger, brevity may have been the movie's greatest asset. 6/10"
10 February 2020,cdennis39,3,8,2,Flimsy Thin barely holding on.,"In the beginning you can see the thin tape holding on Anthony Hopkins goatee especially on his upper lip. Look closely. Tou can see it. Barely holding it there Flimsy, thin barely keeping it k his face. The rest of the film is just lile that. Thin plot. Takes advantage of the trust people had in a once quality product that Disney is in the process of destroying."
13 June 2022,theInfamousPeppapy,1,2,6,Nothing that wrong that good comedy can't fix,"Tessa Thompson is there, to kick men double and triple her size because of diversity and feminism.Loki and Chris Hemsworth are the best part of the movie, the second best is ""i support the current thing"" Mark Ruffalo, if you don't take it as a comedy you are not going to enjoy the movieLoki was the essence of the MCU without him i lost every interest in those movies."
7 April 2018,shadowfax73,1,3,10,Perfect Marvel movie,"Growing up I was a DC kid - Superman, Batman, The Flash, Superboy etc. etc. Since The Marvel Universe and the DC Universe have been releasing movies I have been far more impressed with the Marvel movies than the DC ones. I really like Batman vs Superman, I liked Batman Begins a lot but couldn't see why The Dark Night was rated so highly. Man Of Steel was OK and I enjoyed Justice League but none of those movies compare to Marvel's output. I love (what seems to be) the approach in marvel movies where humor always has a place, there mostly seems a good balance between drama, action and humor and the Thor movies and Iron Man movies typify that best of all due to Robert Downey Jnr. and Chris Hemsworth. The two actors bring personalities to the table that I have never seen in a DC movie. Thor Ragnarok has a higher degree of humor than average and it really adds another layer when watching this movie. Tom Hiddleston also helps make this movie with his understated yet really enjoyable performance - you never know if he loves his brother or is simply setting him up but his character is always charming and you can't help pulling for him a bit. This movie does go some way in clarifying their relationship. Karl Urban as Skurge, Idris Elba as Heimdall and Cate Blanchett as Hela all support the main characters wonderfully well. The movie is a total joy from start to finish but there's one thing I haven't yet mentioned: The director, Taika Waititi, says that about 65% of the movie was improvised. What an excellent approach. If you have the actors capable of carrying that off then you have something special and the actors in Thor Ragnarok all step right up and make the movie one of the best superhero movies I've seen."
3 November 2017,gokulchandanirinkesh,2,5,7,Definitely Worth a Watch!,"Saw this movie first day first show being a Marvel fan and I have to say that waking up early for the movie was worth it.I never imagined that Thor can be this much funny.I always thought of him as a serious character who always follows rules and principles but nah,He changed my perspective about him.It is one of the funniest marvel movies I have ever seen.I am gonna miss the old Thor hairstyle though the new one is also good.The fights displayed on-screen are really good.Finally,we get to know the true power of Thor.It has a very good story and get ready for some heartbreaks too.This movie is a all in one package consisting of action,comedy,good story-line,emotions,etc.Definitely a movie to watch."
23 November 2017,bensonmum2,0,6,7,"""I am Hela, Odin's firstborn, commander of the legions of Asgard, the rightful heir to the throne and the Goddess of Death.""","Thor must do battle with Hela, a sister he never knew he had, if he is to save Asgard. But first, he'll have to escape a gladiatorial planet where he's pitted against an old Friend, Hulk.Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is a very entertaining super-hero, popcorn flick. It really delivers as far as eye-candy goes. Wild fight scenes, amazing spacecraft duels, and crazy special effects at every turn. At times, this thing can be a sensory overload. There's so much going on. Example - the coliseum fight between Thor and Hulk. I would have loved to see that scene slow down just a bit to fully take in the arena and all the crazy looking spectators. I also enjoyed the introduction of Valkyrie. Marvel newcomer Tessa Thompson is a standout in this film. And Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song might have been used for a cheap audience bump, but it worked on me all the same.Despite being wildly entertaining, Thor: Ragnarok is far from perfect. My two lesser complaints include the character Hela (underdeveloped) and some of the cheap looking CGI. My biggest complaint, though, is with the amount of comedy included in the film. I expect a movie like Antman or Spiderman to include a fair amount of comedy - but not a Thor/Hulk film. The way they throw one-liners at each other gets to be downright silly. They were serious characters in the comics I grew up watching - not candidates for open-mike night at the local improv club. It's all wrong.Still, there's too much here to enjoy to call this a bad film. I'm giving it a 7/10."

11 November 2018,rosemariehja,2,4,10,"Taika Waititi Showed Up, Shook Up and Showed Out","Refreshingly hilariously action-packed fun.This film shook up the whole superhero multiverse into something quirky, smart, subtle, riotous, bright with color and camp, and it felt like a cult classic even as I watched it for the first time.As it neared the end I was already planning watching it for a second time.If that ninja cat on a unicorn with a rainbow in the back we're a film, it would be Thor Ragnarok."
26 March 2018,emmalaurabarr,2,3,4,Was not a THOR movie,To much like Guardians of the Galaxy with the colours etc. I hate the fact I have to buy this to go with the collection and also that Chris Hemsworth was made to act in it. Lets hope they do a better job of Infinity War!!
28 March 2020,vishasv,5,9,8,Comedy......Disappointment,"After the likes of winter soldier and civil war, Marvel had a chance of making a dark movie. But they still are sticking to the same formula of comedy+cgi+action. This movie is also driven by the same formula. They ruined the character arc of thor and made him a comedian. But his new look is cool and the only performance that saved this movie was of Hiddleston's and Jeff Goldblum's."
14 February 2018,alihandemiral,4,19,10,Just when I thought Marvel was slowly burning out! SMASH!,"Since the first Avengers, I felt like MCU was slowly burning out, Two ""okay"" ""Captain America"" films there, a ""meh"" Avengers sequel there... Captain America's Civil War and Guardians of the Galaxy - which i didn't actually care for much - gave me hope for a better Cinematic Universe, but next to the third installment of Thor, they were nothing! Funny, action packed and with an altogether stellar cast (including the two famous cameos in the ""play scene"" who will not be named!) ; Thor: Ragnorok easily takes its place as the best MCU film right next to the first Avengers. The regular cast is on fire as always, and Cate Blanchett, Karl Urban and Jeff Goldblum add a great flavour to the film. Personally, I cannot think of any other actors for the roles of these three stars. And finally, looking to see more of my man Korg in the future!!!"
3 January 2018,lesleyharris30,0,6,9,"Ridiculous Fun, Not what I Expected,","Thor: Ragnarok is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast that shine in both dramatic and comedic moments. It far from what the first two Thor movies were, it is a completely different kettle of fish. While being uplifting and containing powerful character arcs that we do care about, it never takes itself too seriously. Thor is more akin to Star Lord than Superman, he is quick witted, sarcastic and a little stupid at times, director Taika Waititi totally changed the tone of the series and took a risk that I am sure he was nervous about, but it all worked out for the better. I did find that they spent a little too much time on Sakaar. Though the characters introduced here were great, it was a pretty boring planet, and I was finding myself thriving for them to return to Asgard, where they should have been brought back sooner. As well as that, Cate Blanchett is put to waste here. Though she is terrific as Hela, she was never given enough screen time, her character's motivations and objectives were never made extremely clear, it was generally a poorly written role. The cast is terrific, despite being his fifth time portraying the character, Chris Hemsworth still steals the show as Thor, we see him having more fun than ever this time around, which is fun for us as an audience. Also joining him is the always brilliant Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffallo, who brings something new as the Hulk this time around, Anthony Hopkins, who is always a pleasure to watch, and Waititi also gives himself a terrific role. Edge of your seat suspense and hilarity. Marvel continue to surprise me, Thor: Ragorak is a blast from start to finish, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action, adventure or comedy. 
Thor must fight to return home to Asgard after his long lost sister takes the throne. 
Best Performance: Chris Hemsworth"
29 January 2018,851222,0,7,9,Fun comedy,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) was much more fun then i thought it will be. First and the last thing best said about this movie is that its basically a comedy - and that what i loved about it. It always was a comedies (these movie i mean) which took them self way to seriously. This one on the other said was pure fun from start till finish.Overall, i highly disliked previous part of this movie. This one i loved it. All Marvel movies should be made like this - stupid but fun comedies."
4 November 2017,hjalsayegh,1,4,7,Fun but weak tea,"The interaction between the characters carries this movie. Chris Hemsworth (as Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (as Loki) carry this movie with the light hearted brother's act. Jeff Goldblum as the grandmaster was just the right amount of ham sandwich. every second he had on screen he owned.The movie was fun and bright with Hel being the big bad that must be defeated this time. The movie got a few chuckles out of me and kept me entertained. However plot wise it was really weak. Hela is doing her thing in Asgard, Thor and Loki is in god knows where doing there thing and met this random person that turns out to be also from Asgard and another avenger to boot... to many coincidences don't make for a strong plot. Then there was the rock guy. He seriously weighed the movie down and no that wasn't an intended pun! Personally I got a strong guardians of the galaxy clone off this movie which is a shame. I would have been happy just watching the actors work of each other. There is also some lack of creativity in the movie as it re-uses previous jokes -the iconic puny god moment, the funny ""he's adopted"" line. all re-used- It was like Loki's fan-fiction come to the big screen.In the end this is a fun popcorn movie, sadly compared to others marvel had put out it's near the bottom."

After finding his father, Odin tells Thor and Loki that a danger is approaching in the form of Hella.This movie is nothing short of fun. The comedic is amazing although out the film and gives the movie something that the other Thor movies didn't have.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, Tom Hiddleston is great a Loki, everyone in this film did a great job. Valkyrie the new character played by Tessa Thompson is sweet. Her character really cool and Tessa does a great Job.Hella played by Cate Blanchett is a good villain but she gets overshadowed a lot by what Thor is doing in the film. The majority of the film takes place on planet Sakaar where Thor and Hulk are pinned in a gladiator style fight. Although very entertaining takes away some of the importance of what is happening on Asgard.Jeff Goldbloom is amazing as the grandmaster. His character is this comedic dictator and Jeff is great in this role.The Comedy throughout is really great but didn't needed to be used in certain places. There are times where a comedic moment happens where there should have been a dramatic moment and it takes away from the importance.All in all this movie is awesome with great comedic moments, likeable characters and a fun story Thor Ragnarok is a highly entertaining film.9/10."

The cinematography and special effects were good though, but those two things do not a movie make...unless it's Star Wars.3 out of 5 stars."

So, why do people like it? Paid contractors? Losers? Haters of Thor? Fans of Loki?This piece of unfunny comedy is typical Disney. Aiming films at a preteen audience that is not serious, does not understand origin of character and does not care about original mythology. Instead unleash a gag a minute and make the seven-year-olds (or people with seven-year-old brains) laugh. yet, even the jokes are not funny.Amazingly, this Thor did not even which god he is and like every other Marvel film has a voice remind him.Pathetic."

In the process Thor is captured by an intergalactic slave trader (Tessa Thompson) and sold to the ruler (Jeff Goldblum) of a battle planet for gladiatorial games.Powerless without his hammer, the god of thunder must learn to rely on others, including Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), if he hopes to save Asgard.Better than both of its predecessors by leaps and bounds, especially in terms of action, acting and humour, director Taika Waititi manages to bring levity to what is essentially Thor's darkest saga yet.

5 November 2017,diac228,1,7,9,A Jarring Shift in Formula Gives us the Best Thor Movie Yet,"I always sound like a broken record, but once again what Disney/Marvel continues to do in the film industry is unprecedented. To be able to pull off a dozen-plus movies and interweave them in the same exact universe (and then toss in television shows that link up) is unfathomably impressive to a point that we take it for granted. When Marvel was bought by Disney, it was a complete mess with their best IPs roaming all over the place and usually in the hands of Disney's very own competitors. What they were left with were properties that were well-known but were not the moneymakers of a Spider-Man or an X-Men. And Disney turned dirt into solid gold. And yes, I am certain I have written the likes of this before.Thor is one of the best examples of a comic being a good supporter in the Marvel universe, but not popular enough to successfully lead an entire trilogy, let alone his own movie. Yet here we are, third film in, and by far the best of three cinematic trips to Asgard. After seeing the success and acceptance of the insanity surrounding the Guardians of the Galaxy, the madmen of Marvel decided to throw out the book of the previous Thor movies and delivered a chaotic experience that meshes mythological themes with Star Wars scope, material of previously made comic books (Planet Hulk has a strong influence here) and then showering it with the 80s Marvel flair that made Guardians so enjoyable in the first place.This movie is action-packed, full of surprises, and has about as much humor as the best of comedies this decade. The storyline nonetheless is a lot more serious than the resulting tone and pace, as we see Thor stuck on a violent distant planet trying to escape and return to his homeland of Asgard and take on the Goddess of Death and prevent the end of his planet. And yes, the Goddess of Death is quite angry for many reasons. Unlike previous Thor flicks though, we have plenty of Marvel characters to see, including Hulk, Doctor Strange, Loki (I point this out because there wasn't enough Loki in The Dark World), and even some memorable new ones like Valkyrie and Korg.Ragnarok fixes all the issues of previous Thor movies and improves upon the elements that worked. For starters, Natalie Portman is gone. Let's toss this out of the way, that woman is a fine actress but was so disinterested in Marvel it shows in her performances. We have a deeper roster of characters, and see more time given to some of the better supporting characters (Once again, Loki). Chris Hemsworth is given more room to be humorous, and this pays off significantly as we are treated with a hilarious performance that is also full of heart and sheer confidence. The casting is excellent, with Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum also providing excellent performances of MCU villains that are actually decent.The biggest and most obvious difference between the MCU and the always-inconsistent DCEU is the cinematic package of each installment. Disney and Marvel have gone to great lengths to make sure none of their blockbuster films ever gets too dreary, too predictable, or too dark. Notice they usually change up directors whenever they feel that the particular series needs a shakeup, resulting in a quirky director from New Zealand providing his talents for Ragnarok. The MCU always tries to blend comic book glee with comedy, some drama and sentimental value, and of course an arsenal of likable characters to always root for. Up until Wonder Woman, DCEU kept the tone somber, kept the tone gloomy, and just piles on the depression while failing to deliver decent characters or a wholesome experience that gives you a variety of emotions.Batman AND Superman lack the heroic flavor of previous generations and this is why Wonder Woman (who has the best actress/writing/directing combo) became the new face of DC---whether they like it or not. You will never see a DC movie get drizzled with 80s flair to lessen the tension and allow you to just enjoy the ride. And it's that 80s flair I keep praising, the zany humor, and the fast-paced directing gives Thor: Ragnarok a feeling of freshness you usually wouldn't expect from third installments of any trilogy. The creative freedom obviously given to the staff (even the musical score ditches the epic sound for a more synth-friendly barrage of tunes) allows for them to make wild series-changing decisions. The final act especially goes off the rails and opens up new doors for new story lines in the near future.Disney and Marvel's big advantage over all the ""universes"" is its ability to link up all the films tightly and be willing to fearlessly expand their horizons for the future. Ragnarok's horizons and overall scope was bursting through the screen, which allowed to see many fun action pieces, delightful cinematography, multiple foes and obstacles, and just relentless top-notch entertainment. The MCU may have had its slight difficulties in the beginning but have quickly emerged into achieving Pixarish levels of expected quality. In a blockbuster film environment that has been sputtering lately, Marvel and Disney continues to shine above the gunk.Link: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"

                        ","Better than the first two installments, but still garbage","The Thor franchise should be the worst in Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first two installments are complete garbage. This third episode is improved, but in a very limited way. More concretely, the screenplay is added with more adventure and humor, but the plot as a whole is too scattered and unfocused. Particularly, the gladiator part is unnecessarily too long. The talent of Cate Blanchett is largely wasted in such a movie. I hope that she could play some more challenging roles."
5 April 2019,pcyrene,5,11,2,Highly Disappointed,Had I seen this movie prior to buying the DVD I would have never bought the DVD. I ended up and turned the dvd off about a half hour into it. It was all joke joke joke n not very funny at all. I was expecting the usual action with good story plot to it as the other Thor movies and Marvel series. Very disgusted.
10 July 2022,Floated2,0,0,9,Thoroughly engaging and humorous,"Thor Ragnarok has been fittingly described by many as the best Thor film in the franchise and after watching, certainly see why. In comparison to the previous films, this feels a lot more energetic, more colourful, and far more humorous and family friendly. The appeal seemed to have worked as it grossed more than the previous two Thor films.The additions of new characters such as Valkyrie and Hela were great choices as they fit the criteria and bring a certain energetic tone. Also the addition of the Hulk was great as the chemistry between him and Thor were possibly the highlights.The action here is better, the music soundtrack during the finale fight scene on the bridge fits greatly and overall this film doesn't feel like it dragged on (it is the longest run time of the series yet is able to get the best out of everything). With new direction, the cast seemed to be having the most fun out of the film, notably Chris Hemsworth. Further providing anticipation for Thor: Love and Thunder."
10 November 2017,barbagvido,1,4,7,Way too funny for it's own good,"Thor:Ragnarok is already the 17th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the third Thor movie. It's directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) and stars Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston. In this one Thor faces Hela who wants to take over Asgard, she casts him out and this time he's thrown on a completely different planet where he reunites with Hulk and tries to build a team to stop Hela.This movie is very funny (even though there are a few forced jokes) and light-hearted. But is that necessarily a good thing? I'm not saying this movie should be humorless. But they really went over the top with this one. I'm used to Marvel joking around, but they usually know when to get emotional. Not here. I mean it's freaking Ragnarok, that's supposed to be really, really epic! And at least serious at the end. The movie is really anything but epic. Just when things starts to get serious it seems the writers chicken out and guess what, here's another joke for you! Would you look at that? Isn't that hilarious? Ha, ha, ha! Don't get me wrong, I laughed at quite a lot of them, but sometimes it really seems like they were trying way too hard. Characters are very goofy. A bit too much. To everyone thinking they got everyone right here, remember this. Thor is a god of thunder. A freaking god, not some random funny dude! I'm not saying he should be serious, Thir never was like that, but this is way too much. There are maybe two or three actually kinda serious scenes in the entire movie that are pretty good, but then it all turns to silliness again and those scenes feel like they belong to a different movie they continued making a spoof of. I know that all this might sound like I hated the movie, but it's far from that, I'll get to the pros now. This is probably the most stylish MCU ever got. Regardless of the silliness it's probably the most creative direction we got from Marvel yet. Even though it could have been more, but that's on the writers. We get this colorful fantasy world with a lot of synth-wave music popping up in the background. And two amazing uses of ""Immigtant Song"" by Led Zeppelin. The acting is pretty good and you can see the actors enjoying themselves in the roles. Also, the ending was pretty surprising, but just as many parts of this movie, was ruined with constant jokes. There were a lot of surprising and entertaining cameos, I loved those as they added fuel to the fun that this movie was.All in all, while it's good, I thought it was a huge disappointment since in my opinion this story should have been handled a bit more seriously. I did get tons fun and laughs, but it's not what I wanted from this movie. This was supposed to be epic. I expected one of the best MCU movies, but honestly I thought it was closer to the weaker ones. But it's the best one of the Thor movies. And it's still a lot of fun with a little deviation in style that felt necessary to freshen the franchise up a bit."

He must find a way to escape this nasty situation before his sister finishes her destructive plan.The third installment of the Thor series presents the god of lightning in desperate situation from which he must escape as soon as possible in order to save his people from annihilation. Along the way, he'll encounter an friend in an unpleasant situation of his own who will play an important role in the upcoming events. Contrary to my expectations, this movie takes a rather unique way of telling its story, by switching to the funny side way more often than the first movie, this way making the whole experience much more enjoyable. It's characters are good and quite well defined, the plot is OK while the finale is satisfying and unpredictable. The only thing that made me lower its rating was the superficiality with which a couple of important scenes from this movie were treated. Indeed, I have high expectations and I might have judged it a bit too harsh, but I was expecting a bit more in terms of plot complexity in those respective scenes, something that could have made it truly excellent. You might not even notice them and even if you do, you'll surely find a great movie in this one as I did.Overall, I was profoundly surprised by the way this movie managed to embrace comedy, despite its fantastical and supposedly serious setting, making you laugh at loud multiple times throughout its length. Together with a couple of good characters and plot, it ended up as a very good movie which was able to provide a bit over two hours of quality cinema time."
5 August 2018,mtrburrows,1,2,7,"Who cares if it's different, this is awesome!","The main aspect that makes this film so good is the tone - Marvel finally decided to make Thor fun to watch and the comedy, the music, the locations, and the characters are some of the best in the MCU. This is all apparent when the characters are on the vibrant and bursting with energy planet of Saccar. This is truly the highlight of the movie, and what saves it, with Jeff Goldblum giving just...just such a Goldblum performance I miss him every time he's not onscreen.Basically everything that doesn't take place on Saccar is what brings the movie down. The first 20 minutes or so feels disjointed and uninteresting, and anything with the bland and cliché villain on Asgard is so tiresome.As a result this is a very mid-tier Marvel movie, it has very high highs but still falls victim to the forgettability and boringness of the Thor franchise (although this is undoubtedly the best of the three). The comedy is very clearly improvised and 90% of the time it works, but some of it can feel awkward, especially between Hemsworth and Ruffalo (although the Thor/Hulk team up is one of the things that makes this movie.Great comedy, great atmosphere, but weak story. As said before, just a mid-tier marvel movie."
5 November 2017,CANpatbuck3664,1,9,9,Thor Ragnarok is Just What the Doctor Ordered For This Franchise,"A lot of people act like Thor is one of Marvel's lesser properties. I actually have a soft spot for the first Thor. It was surprisingly funny, it translated some pretty out there ideas into being plausible and Chris Hemsworth made for a charismatic hero. That being said, Thor: The Dark World was disappointing and before any promotional material was released, I don't think anyone was expecting much from Thor 3. I have to credit Waititi and his team for bringing a different kind of style to this movie. We've seen the neon colour palette in other comic book movies (Guardians Vol. 2, and Suicide Squad come to mind) but this addition is welcome here. It brings life into the movie, the action scenes are well shot and they use the CGI to create some cool looking characters. This could have been treated as a minor project that didn't garner much attention from the studio but they didn't sell out and they put the effort into this to create something memorable.The previous Thor movies have spent a large chunk of time on Earth, sometimes to the movies' detriment. They make a good decision to only spend a chunk on Midgard and take you to new places and introduce new characters. In fact, they dispatch of Thor's band of merry men so quickly I almost started laughing. Sakaar is so different and the hype around the gladiator games on it are a lot of fun. I also thought they created some interesting characters, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, Skurge and Korg all have their moments. There's a lot of funny dialogue and while the other entries in the Thor franchise dipped their toes in the comedic pool, Ragnarok dives in with mostly successful results. The friend I went to see this with said it was a little too goofy at times but I think they hit a nice balance.Chris Hemsworth has everything you need to be a leading man, he just has a hard time getting good projects (Rush was awesome, Ghostbusters..... not so much). He slips into Thor like a glove and he carries this movie with ease. Tessa Thompson was the ace up this movie's sleeve. She's funny in her own right and she handles her supporting part easily. I would love to see her in another Marvel movie. Loki is probably Marvel's best villain and Hiddleston is a star for a reason. He always steals scenes as Loki and this movie is no exception. Idris Elbas is decent, Anthony Hopkins doesn't have to do too much, Goldblum is having fun as the Grandmaster, Karl Urban is funny and I enjoyed Waititi's voice performance as Korg. Mark Ruffalo has always been good as Banner/Hulk and one of the best parts of the movie is his confrontation with Thor. I also want to credit Cate Blanchett, I don't Hela is among Marvel's best written villains but it's her performance that makes Hela formidable. I'm not going to mention any of the cameos but I thought the one from another major Marvel franchise was pretty pointless and underwhelming.I don't have many complaints about Ragnarok but there are a few. I thought the movie started pretty slowly, there are funny moments in Thor's early adventures but there is a ton of hype around this movie and I was questioning if this was going to meet those high expectations. The stuff surrounding Odin didn't pack the emotional punch I think they were going for. But I also think the movie picked up steam as it went along so that corrected the problem. Again, not all of the cameos are great, the movie is littered with Easter eggs so it was inevitable that some of them are hit or miss.I think this movie delivered what you would want going into it. There's lots of fun and creative action scenes, plenty of hilarious jokes and some good characters to latch onto. Thor: Ragnarok is every bit a worthy entry into Marvel's canon and I think it will wash some of the disappointment away from the Thor franchise. Among the 3 Marvel releases I saw this year, I'd put it ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 but behind Spiderman: Homecoming. If you're a dedicated Marvel fan this is an easy choice to see but I think the uninitiated will be charmed by this too."
29 October 2017,zakand,13,29,7,Good fun but lacks depth,"As a fan of Taika Waititi I was very excited to see him at the helm of an MCU movie, especially a Thor film the character I have always felt was the weakest Avenger and the one that nobody seemed to know which direction to take in. Waititi fixed this issue and all of a sudden made Thor a more likable and interesting character, Chris Hemsworth providing a hilarious and brilliant performance like the rest of the cast. The comedy created a jovial atmosphere that is not present in most marvel films and this alongside the vibrant use of colour in the film appears to mark a turning point in the MCU.However I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed by this film. Firstly Cate Blanchett was excellent as Hela, proving to be one of the best villain the MCU has to offer, however she was slightly underused. Also the film lacked depth, almost trying too hard to be humorous in certain places instead of focusing on backstories or character's emotions which may have been more effective. Whilst the upbeat, fun of the film was welcome it felt wrong during particular moments that involved the planet Hulk story line, a fantastic more serious story. It was a shame that such a rich story was merely brushed over. Furthermore, Taikia Waititi may need to work more on producing grand, large scale films because, even though the his personal touches were nice, for a film about Ragnarok (the end of everything) it felt very small and didn't occupy the grandeur it possibly deserved. Also maybe just because I love Taikai Watiti's style of comedy I went in expecting more humour similar to that of the character Korg (played by Waititi) however that is just personal preference.Overall this is a fun, enjoyable and visually epic (except on some of the occasions when green screen was used ) film, but for everything good about it there is an equal number of problems with it."
23 December 2017,Vartiainen,0,5,8,"Good solid adventure, with some tone problems","Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor, the crown prince and guardian of Asgard. The story picks up some time after the events of the last Thor film as well as those of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor is furiously searching through the realms, looking to prevent Ragnarok, the end of Realm Eternal, which he foresaw coming in Ultron. But then one of Asgard's oldest enemies, Hela, the goddess of death (Cate Blanchett), breaks loose from her prison.What this film has in abundance, apart from the usual Marvel goodies of great action, stunning visuals and all that good stuff, is style. It's a colourful, punk-futuristic blast of heavy metal, acid trips and far too much chrome. It's like watching one of those 70s acid music videos, except with great story, characters built upon by numerous previous films and a lore deep enough to encompass something even this weird and bizarre.We also get Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who's always a welcome addition. And, this time we actually get to spend time with the big green guy. Usually it's about Bruce Banner trying to live with this curse of his and the green guy only comes out when it's time to fight. But this time we get more of Hulk, not Banner, which is a nice change.And as stated, there are the usual Marvel upsides. The visuals are phenomenal, the action scenes are enjoyable and returning characters are a lot of fun - with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) once again stealing the show.All that being said, I do have problems with the film. For one, I didn't much care for Blanchett's character. She's a great actress, but Hela was written as a pretty bland villain. Things didn't go her way and now she wants revenge. There is some good stuff when she's talking about her past with Odin, but it doesn't amount to much in the end. Though it is nice to hear more about the history of Asgard.But the far bigger problem this film has is that of tone. Specifically knowing when to make a joke and when to allow the scene to play out without the crutch of humour. Doctor Strange had this same problem where almost every badass scene, every scene of drama, every scene of any potential weight or depth, was capped with a quick quip or a visual gag or a one liner. But here it's far worse. Whenever I was starting to get into the mood, whenever anyone did anything noteworthy or cool, someone made a pratfall, or went flying through a window, or got his looks mocked by a bystander, or a piano crashed on his head, or something. Okay, not that last one, but I wouldn't have been surprised if that did happen. Disappointed, yes, but not surprised.Then again, I've heard this film's humour praised to high heavens, so perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I do think it's a problem that Marvel seems to be losing the courage to let scenes carry themselves. It's their thing to keep these movies lighthearted and fun, but if that is taken too far, the films loose their substance, their weight. The problem with DC films is that they're way too grimdark. Unfortunately with this film Marvel seems to be heading towards the opposite end of the spectrum. Which is equally bad.But, it was still an enjoyable watch and a good film. It's probably the most problematic film I've seen in the MCU, but that still means that it's merely a good film instead of a great one."
1 October 2018,scb_coldsteel,1,5,8,Best Thor movie yet!,"Just got out of the new Thor. Easily the best in the series. Marvel has really figured out how to combine action, comedy, and fun stories into a movie. I absolutely love the character interaction and dialogue. Valkyrie was a great addition to the Marvel Universe. Not only was she a much-needed strong female character, but she delivered some great lines. This is also the best movie for Loki's character development. He steals the show during almost every scene he is in.Plus all the fight scenes were very well done. They somehow manage to combine non-stop action with humor. I really didn't think I would laugh this much in a Thor movie. The fight near the end of the movie is particularly well-choreographed. This was the first time you really felt Thor's power as a god during a fight scene.Animation was great and it had some very funny moments. I really enjoyed the interactions between Thor and Hulk. The villain was a bit weak, but the fun factor kept me entertained. A 8.5 out of 10."
20 April 2018,garthlotel,1,3,8,"Great, satisfying and funny","The combination of Taika's humour with the Marvel universe is brilliant. It must be difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this universe, and new ways for our heroes to entertain us, but this film delivers a fresh and exciting storyline and great new characters while lifting the wit to a new level. The action is top notch, of course. And our villainess - played by Cate Blanchett, who is clearly loving every minute of her deliciously dark role - is sublime.The ending is wonderful. The film is simply excellent. Can't wait for the next one."

                        ",a really good change of pace,"Some years have passed and Thor has become a lone wanderer seeking out answers regarding the fate of the universe, until the bloodthirsty Hela escapes captivity and declares full-fledged war on Asgard. Thor—imprisoned on the other side of the galaxy in a race against time—must outlast the Hulk in a contest of champions while the fate of Asgard hangs in the balance. Despite a familiar setup, this silly and bombastic sequel completely veers from the style and tone established by its predecessors and features some exciting action scenes, unique new characters, laugh-out loud humor, and enough references to remind audiences that despite the absurdly in-joke tone of the film that it still is—in fact—a part of the larger Marvel Universe. Hemsworth looks to be having more fun here than in any other of his previous outings as the hero, and both Blanchett and Goldblum have a whale of a time in their colorful supporting roles. Give credit to director Taika Waititi for taking an already established franchise and turning it in a completely different direction. ***"
26 January 2018,kbykuzey,7,13,1,Comedy movie,"They are not serious, I was expecting many sacrifices for asgard and not jokes. Of course people like comedy and imdb point good for now. I think you dont respect pagans. I know its not make sense but people believed that gods. We have to respect old gods and pagans. Shame on you."
25 April 2018,radosm-72496,2,3,6,Finally a decent Thor movie,"It took Marvel two standalone movies and two Avenger movies to finally get the right note for this character. How do you make a movie about a comic book character based on a god from Norwegian mythology played by an Australian surfer dude? As a full fledged comedy of course, and Taika was a perfect guy to do just that. 
While Hemsworth is struggling badly with serious roles, thankfully here he is a (sort of) parody of himself from a previous movies, and it works like a charm, because he is a very talented comedian. Also, his chemistry with Loki, played by Tom is perfect, they work excellent together without drama component from the first two movies.
I need to mention that Taika himself as a Korg is hilarious and Jeff Goldblum as an intergalactic despot is just pure gold.
The downside - Valkyrie actress Thessa Thompson."
9 March 2019,nikolaoskouloglou,3,5,7,Fun,"This was more entertaining than I expected, I usually don't like comedies, but I enjoyed this one. Thor was awesome and I enjoyed his character development. Valkyrie was also great even though I usually dislike this kind of character.The problem I see with the movie is that the main villain didn't have a lot of development. She was just...there. It's not the fault of the actress though, she did a good job. Loki also felt a bit awkward. In my opinion, they should have kept him a villain instead of going back and forth."
12 June 2018,shadow_blade-89459,1,3,8,Hilarious,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) is a comedic action adventure about a Thor, the God of Thunder, played by Chris Hemsworth, as he tries to return to his home planet after being imprisoned on planet Sakaar. He fights to stop Ragnarok from occurring and defeat the villainous Hela, played by Cate Blanchett. This film is not the best Marvel Universe film I have seen, but it is still great and tremendously hilarious. With exception to most of the action scenes, every corner has a touch of comedy riddled in the storyline. Most of the special effects in the film are spot on, but when they aren't, it is very noticeable. The main storyline is of this film is unmistakable, but the little snippets for the supporting cast help to build the overall back story. Director Taika Waititi did an amazing job fitting those sequences in the film and allowing the comedy to breath where ever possible.I thought the acting was outstanding. Nothing seemed forced by any of the characters except for the early scenes by Volstagg, played by Ray Stevenson. The scenes following his time as gate keeper felt smoother, like he had grown more into the role. As with many of the Marvel films, the landscapes looked very enticing with all the vibrant colors. Overall, this film is great, and I recommend at least one viewing to those who enjoy action with a serving of comedy."
23 April 2018,iamtheuf,1,2,7,"Best Thor Movie, Average Marvel Movie",The first Thor sucked. Second one is decent. This if the only good one. It's the best Thor movie but not among the best marvel movies. The addition of humor lands unevenly. Sometimes its a welcome addition. Sometimes it feels out of place and takes you away from the plot. Somethings are just cheesy and unnecessary (think naked Hulk and Hulk dick jokes).
16 May 2021,ashleighleeming,8,17,10,one of my favourite films ever made,"I absolutely love this film, i can watch it time and time again and never get bored. I love it with my whole being, just watch it and you'll get what i mean."
2 February 2018,XweAponX,0,9,10,Much better the second time.,"When I first watched this film I thought it was way over the top and I really didn't like it too much. Primarily because there are a lot of really bad things that happen. But as I go back and I view each section of this film, this is a film that had to happen.First off we saw at the end of ""The Dark World"" that Thor was speaking to Odin, and in the very final reveal it wasn't Odin at all, but Loki instead. Who apparently somehow faked his own death, and then took Odin's Place.So that little issue had to be dealt with. In a small side note, when Thor comes back home for a short time there is a play being held in honor of Loki, and the actor playing Odin is actually Sam Neill.Then, there was a question of what ever happened to Bruce Banner/The Hulk? And there is a surprising answer to this question, which Thor accidentally stumbles into.The part that really bothered me was suddenly, Thor has a sister named Hela who looks like a goth chick with a bad hair day, who happens to be more powerful than anybody that Thor has ever come up against. And this was Galadriel even (Cate Blanchette), Who I didn't even recognize at all until I saw the end credits. Like, WHAT?!? She's one of those actresses that apparently never ages. I don't know if she did any of her stunts in this, I don't think she did in the third hobbit film either, when she gets all dark world and stuff.A lot of time is spent on an apparent Trash-Planet, Saakar, run by Jeff Goldblum. And this is where he meets an unlikely ally, Tessa Thompson. The character actually doesn't really have a name, she is referred to as what she was: a Valkyrie. Possibly the very last one. And also a guy made out of rocks, ""Korg"" played by the films very director, Taika Waititi, who is surprisingly very good and funny. He also played the bounty/nurse-bot in the Mandalorian.The final part of this film brings us back to Asgard that is not really in very good shape due to the ministrations of Hela. And then Clancy Brown is a huge monster and guess what happens? That's right, the Hulk tries to kill it.What I liked about this film is that it shows how the Hulk would have been after two whole years of being the hulk. He even developed a rudimentary language of sorts.There are simply way more good things in this film than bad. And it's also a necessary film for the storyline occurring in The MCU.Finally I liked the fact that Loki and Thor actually start respecting each other as brothers, despite whatever Loki had done he was still family to Thor, and to Odin.I just went through this edit and I see NO reason for it to be declined. I wanted to leave my original review down there for comparison sake. Thank you.===== previous review=====>>>But the reason I'm giving this a 9/10 is because, the parts that are good are very good. Actually, to blazes with the FakeAccounts downvoting me, I'm changing it to 10/10.This new director, Taika Waititi (from Flight of the Concords) maybe should not have done such a huge property, but he did well in most spots. Especially during Dr Strange's ""cameo"".What I did not like was a lot of familiar things were taken away in this installment, including some accouterments beloved by Thor fans. And some people from the first two films.What starts out as a mysterious hunt for Odin turns rapidly into something else. Then, suddenly, the story is split. A Good story has a good Beginning, Middle and End. This film has a good beginning, but replace ""Muddle"" for middle here. Nevertheless, by the time the 3rd act rolls out, these distractions have been validated as necessary parts of the story.It is still entertaining and has a lot of imagery from the first Thor installment. Heimdall is back, and seeing everywhere, but for a while replaced by ""Skurge"" (A Bald and Tattooed Karl Urban, using his native New Zealander Accent). And we knew that Loki had been pretending to be Odin, from The Dark World. Enter ""Hela"", an unimaginable threat, played by an unrecognizable Cate Blanchette. And some new characters Played by Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson (who played across Anthony Hopkins in ""Westworld"").Scenes showing Bifrost are perfectly matched with the first film, everything looks like it should, so most of my points are given for continuity. Even the ""Asgard"" music from the first film is played. I was halfway expecting Guardians of the Galaxy to show up and save Thor, but alas, it wasn't them. And there was the usual amount of guest roles by other Marvel superheroes.Much better the second time"
4 April 2022,Stefffen,5,15,1,Its a parody,"This movie is not a movie about nordic king Thor, it's just a parody.... there is no rant or good writing in this movie, just unfunny sketches about Thor acting, cinematography, writing and storylines ARE HORRIBLE this movie should never be tied to Thor."
27 November 2017,drqshadow-reviews,0,6,9,"A Riotous Buddy Comedy in Space, Spiritual Sibling to Marvel's Guardians","I had concerns after Ragnarok's trailers. Not because they were weak, but more the opposite: I worried that the finished product couldn't live up to the steep expectations they'd set. That, and I had anxiety that the out-of-nowhere neon '80s theme would be a thin, superficial gimmick, slapped on to ride a trend and nothing more. In both respects, I couldn't have been more wrong. The trailer's just the tip of the iceberg for this epic, sprawling, colorful, unabashedly hilarious joyride of an adventure. It does the big blockbuster moments well, with power and meaning and a shiver-inducing use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" in two key spots. The dialog is right on-point for the duration, looser and more conversational than any of the previous Marvel films. Credit director Taika Waititi for that, allowing the cast to ad-lib freely in nearly every scene. Sakaar, a new planet that doubles as hub for all the universe's discarded crap, is a day-glow fantasy that would've been right at home in one of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. In that setting, the retro graphics and glitchy synth score (a wonderful contribution from Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh) feel natural, and we're able to enjoy a fresh perspective on the Avengers' resident lightning-slinger. It does attempt to do an awful lot - I haven't even mentioned Cate Blanchett's sinister turn as this week's dark flavor - and that gives the first hour a rather scattered, random personality. Everything comes together nicely in time for the grand climax, though, and I left the theater with a huge grin and a new favorite of the MCU. It's everything I wanted, and a few things I didn't know I needed."
3 November 2017,drawlife,1,4,8,"""Hela"" fun, despite some inconsistencies.","I always felt that Thor himself is a character who for the most part was handled decently, but his movies were a mess and not exactly the MCU's best outings. Branagh and Taylor brought their own spin on it, but out of them, I felt that Joss Whedon got him the best. He's not supposed to be taken too seriously as he is an Asgardian God of Thunder after all. I felt Whedon balanced that along with some gravitas more coherently. With being said Captain America and Iron Man have had their limelight, and Thor for the most part has not. His movies are mediocre compared to Cap's trilogy or the first Iron Man film. I think Kevin Feige and Taika Waititi were aware of this problem. What Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man did to those characters, Thor Ragnarok does the exact same to Thor. Feige, Waititi, and Hemsworth reinvents the character and it feels very refreshing. It is definitely the best entry to Thor's trilogy. As a movie going experience, it's entertaining as hell. It's fun, funny, and hip, but as a comic-book fan, the film does take liberties with source materials from great Marvel stories and crams it in all together. While I do think that any movie that is based off of source materials should take liberties in order to fit better for the big screen, I happened to not agree with some of the things they changed in the film. It wasn't exactly what wanted, but for the most part it's handled with care. The cast is great and they look like they're having a blast. Hemsworth and Hiddleston can play these roles in their sleep at this point. They both own the roles and embody them better than ever. The brotherly relationship is still effective. Thor even points out that Loki is still being himself, and will probably never change. Ruffalo also could play his role in his sleep. Hulk can talk now and he's developed his own personality. He has the vocabulary of a three year old and certainly acts like one. The Hulk vs Thor fight recaptured the novelty of when I first saw those two fight each other in the first Avengers film. It's definitely of one the highlight action set pieces of the movie. It's staged well in a gladiator like arena and this time they don't hold back. Their banter is also fun to watch. Jeff Goldblum is a delight as the Grandmaster. He's kinda acting like his real life self and hopefully we'll see him and his brother in a scene one day. The female characters were always lacking the Thor films aside from Lady Sif. Tessa Thompson is a welcome addition. What I also admired is that Waititi and his team, despite her being a badass, don't let her become some redundant romantic interest. They just have a mutual respect for each other. Some of the side characters are also fun, including Waititi himself who portrays Korg, a rock like being with very humorous quips. Speaking of female characters, Cate Blanchett commands the screen as Hela. She does make one heck of an entrance (even though it was shown in the trailers). She brings Asgard to it's demise and she puts up a really good fight against Thor. Unfortunately it still does not solve Marvel's villain problem. Her story seemed like it was at the end of the spectrum. Her role seemed a little lost compared to the other moving parts of the film. Piggy backing off that, while this movie is relentlessly entertaining, I felt that it was missing some weight. Even though the action is amplified and the stakes are there, I never felt a sense of danger or tension. Some of the comedy also was a bit of a miss, although Goldblum's Grandmaster and Waititi's Korg never missed the mark. It doesn't exactly go to the level of the annoying humor Guardians Vol. 2 had, but it was pretty close. Blanchett helped eased some of the jokiness but a little more weight would have been more engaging for me. Despite all that, third time really is the charm for Thor. Despite some changes I don't particularly like and the crammed in story lines from other amazing comics, it's still a fun ride. But what really got my jitters going was the mid credit scene. Avengers: Infinity War cannot get here sooner. It's going to be a long wait. 8/10"
3 November 2017,justinwfirestone,1,5,7,"Knowingly funny, tongues in cheeks for sure","Apparently ""Thor: Another Thor Movie"" had already been taken? Or possibly ""Thor: Thor More""? Perhaps best would have been ""Thor The Thord""?Regardless, and at this point, probably irregardless, even, there will be a point at which no more movies like Thor: Ragnarok will be made, goofy fun-fests with pointless plots and scenes that do little more than offer a transition opportunity and a setup for another joke. Thankfully there are no entangling love lines to get all caught up in along the way.In other words, perfectly fine films. Yes, you heard it here first. Thor: Ragnarok is a Perfectly Fine Film.It's funny. Taika Waititi knows it's funny. How else could you keep a straight face while pretending to be a superhero or supervillainess based on Norse mythology? We know it's funny because we get a handful of wonderful cameos and meta-comedy (meta-dramedy?), and plenty of inside jokes and Easter eggs to fill a whole 44-ounce popcorn cup. We also take part obliquely in a bonus morality lesson about only playing for or only rooting for the winning team. Is it ethical to choose evil paths if it keeps you alive? When is self-sacrifice going to achieve the most screen time?Jeff Goldblum can do more with a wink and a smile than Ben Affleck could ever do with his whole stupid face. Cate Blanchett has a lot of knives to throw and she seems really angry, so look out. Mark Ruffalo shows up. Thor gets a haircut and a few close shaves.Ahem, there's a really powerful Infinity Gem and something called the Eternal Flame just waiting to be touched and used, and they're, like, just downstairs and to the right, dude. Should we go down there and get them?Indeed, ""Thor: Perfectly Fine."""
16 November 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,0,2,7,7.5. The director tossed it.,"Thor 3I have mixed feelings about this film. To make a long story, the director turned a potentially epic grand freaking awesomely outstanding masterpiece into just a sort of fun film with good action. I MEAN SH!T! HELLA! Hella was so so sooooo good but the stupid hipster director wanted to hangout with Jeff Goldblum for over an hour so we got stuck with a okayish comedy over what could have been one of the best superhero films ever made. You get my point. Still, like I said before - the film is okay but the wasted potential just makes you want to throw sh$t at the screen. The actors and action choreographer saved the movie."
18 May 2022,Reviews_of_the_Dead,0,1,8,Another Fun Popcorn Movie that Ramps Us Up to Infinity War,"This is another movie that was a rewatch for me from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The last time I saw this was catching up in prep to see Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War. Jaime and I watched this together as we are gearing up to finally see both Infinity War and Endgame for the Internet Movie Database poster we are working through.What I will say is that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) was a character that I wasn't excited about but ends up having some of the more interesting and entertaining movies. I like taking this Norse god and putting it into space. It ends up making it more intriguing for me when they explore elements of the comics and beyond. Plus, I like Hemsworth.For this movie, we our main villain is Hela (Cate Blanchett). She is the sister of Thor and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). She is also the goddess of death. Having freed herself from the prison that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) put her in, she wants to take her rightful place on the throne and take over Asgard. This forces Thor and Loki to flee. The former tries to find the strength and help to defeat Hela. It leads him to a Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) as well as showing us what happened to Bruce Banner aka The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron.What I will say about all these movies from the MCU, they are CGI-fest. With the Disney money, it looks good. We get some great things to bring to life Asgard as well as other planets. I like that this universe incorporates elements from Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and using the credits scene from there. We get more characters; some epic battles scenes and it is just a fun movie. It runs long, but it doesn't feel like it. This one isn't doing too much story wise, but I credit Taika Waititi for adding some humor and making this a popcorn movie.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10."

18 November 2017,Kingslaay,0,6,8,Enjoyable and a treat to watch,Thor: Ragnarok was great fun to watch. I never felt at anytime that I had to think too hard but could sit back and enjoy the fun filled film. Marvel seems to produce high quality and enjoyable films with ease. The key is to make a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and have fun with it. The jokes were well placed and it had some great characters to enhance the story. Cate Blanchette makes an excellent villain as Thor's forgotten older sister and is transformed and unrecognisable. A great treat and good experience at the movies. 7.5/10
26 November 2017,harrylosborne,1,6,8,Give Taika Waititi all the Marvel films (and DC whilst you're at it),"As someone who watches Marvel films more to understand their universe better, rather than expecting a good film, Thor: Ragnarok was both a pleasant surprise and a great watch. Reviews of this genre tend to always be generous, but this film (led amazingly by Chris Hemsworth) was genuinely worth the watch for all the reasons superheroes should be.The action was the best for a Marvel film to date, with great fight scenes, intelligent choreography and legitimate balance between those involved. The set design and score lend a hand into the execution of this as well; flawless CGI and the best score to date (bar the GotG series) allowed for full immersion, only broken by the necessary dialogue used in the film.Comedically, I would have no doubt as putting this as the best Marvel film to date - Waititi does justice to a great script, with Hemsworth (who Waititi said had been underused as a comedic actor in the past), Blanchett and Hiddleston (plus an unlikely source in new character Korg) all being cast brilliantly, just to name a few. The casting was exceptional in allowing the funny side of this film through, with even the minor actors like Jeff Goldblum and a cameo-ed Matt Damon making scenes even more memorable. Taika brought all the necessary elements together seamlessly, making watching this film a spectacle in storytelling, rather than a predictable going-through- the-motions that is so common with movies of this ilk.Overall, whilst this film may not have had a major impact on the MCU as a whole, Thor: Ragnarok gave me hope for a genre been bled dry in its current state, and making me pray for a suitably brilliant ending for the Infinity Wars films to come. I urge the DC directors out there (if there are any others than Zack Snyder) to take a leaf from Taika Waititi's book, and see that the superhero genre has so much more to offer."
28 October 2017,bbosnic,19,47,5,Entertaining,"Not a bad way to spend 2h to get your mind off of everyday things. It's full of colors and beautiful CIGs. And that's about it. But it is entertaining. It is closer to a comedy infused movie like the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" than it is to the first Thor movie witch I really liked. And while the movie made me smile a few times, I can't help but thinking: is this what the viewers want these days? To see distant, magical worlds on the screen, and magical, eternal, godlike beings acting and making jokes like in some sitcom like ""Will & Grace"" and ""Friends""? If the answer is ""yes"" then you will enjoy this movie."
8 November 2017,jadepietro,0,5,7,"Have Hammer, Will Travel","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Another comic book hero is given a major reboot with an accent more on comedy than logic sense or real drama.SYNOPSIS: Thor battles his revengeful evil sister.JIM'S REVIEW: The Marvel comic book universe is bursting at its spandex seams with all of its superheroes, both major or minor. One of the oddest of the lot has always been Thor, a god steeped in Norse mythology who possesses a magical hammer as his weapon of mass destruction. Thor: Ragnarok is now the third in the series that celebrates this hunky he-man, if one excludes his previous supporting roles and cameos in other Marvel movies of course. (That inter-breeding exists in this installment as well, with other superheroes like Dr. Strange and The Hunk making their entrances with their usual flair. Aside from some funny moments in this outing, nothing is there.)The nonsensical plot involves Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his bad brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) fighting their even badder banished sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), for ownership of their kingdom, Asgard. The film's narrative sets up major changes in this jocular central character. It updates Thor with a modern leaner look as the filmmakers dispatch his mighty hammer and his shoulder-length tresses at the film's midway point. Many battles ensue and Thor is sent across the universe to meet other perils along his journey to self discovery. Director Taika Waititi (who also does voice-over duty for one of the movie's creatures) turns up the comedy with mixed results. The overall campy tone works sometimes, that is, whenever Ms. Blanchett takes the reins to reign over our hero and his crusading sidekicks. More often the humor falls flat, particularly whenever Jeff Goldblum minces his way through the role as Grandmaster. (The actor is clueless with his character who should be menacing and a larger threat than the narcissistic power-hungry moron he portrays. Really, can anyone with those traits run a planet? Never mind.) Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins fill out the rest of the cast with as little screen time or presence as needed.The screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher L. Yost wants to pound us over the head with the silly hi-jinks and doesn't build any tension in its story because of its comic intent. The comedy simply undercuts the semi-seriousness of its ludicrous plot. It just can't have it both ways. If the film doesn't take itself seriously, why should we? The characters continually leaps from planet to planet, with no apparent reason. So does the script, making numerous leaps of logic to advance its puny plot.Except for the aforementioned awful performance of Mr. Goldblum, the rest of the cast works overtime to charm its audience. Chris Hemsworth as our slightly dim hero is again well toned and well cast. Giving strong support are Tom Hiddleston as the cunning Loki and Mark Ruffalo as Mr. Bipolar himself, The Hulk, a.k.a. Bruce Banner. The three actors have a nice rapport on screen that really registers. As the conflicted Skurge, Karl Urban adds some nuance to his underwritten character and Tessa Thompson has some some nice moments of female empowerment as Valkyrie, Female Warrior (channeling enough Michelle Rodriguez estrogen and persona into her supporting turn.)Still with all its flaws, the movie consistently entertains. Its most effective sequence in the entire movie is the gladiator inspired arena war between Thor and his green adversary which the director stages quite well. This set piece mixes the drama and comedy elements to full advantage. But too often, the many battle scenes are blurred and photographed upfront and personally in-your-face technique that obstructs the action. The CGI is mostly above average, although the best visual effect by far is Mr. Hemsworth's muscular physique in his shirtless scene. Thor: Ragnarok will awe its target audience, but this reviewer needs at least a hint of intelligence in its storytelling. Just how often do we need to leave our brains at the door whenever we step into this genre."
13 November 2017,jellopuke,0,4,8,Lots of fun,"While I wish they'd dropped the villain of the week stuff and just made a movie about Thor and Hulk on weirdo planet overthrowing Jeff Goldblum, I realize that Marvel will never do that, so what we are left with is a movie that has some great comedy mixed in with the usual action fighting bits. The weirdness and goofiness was fun and I wish there was more of it and less of the Cate Blanchett stuff, but overall this was an enjoyable ride and worth seeing."

27 October 2019,postsenthil,1,5,7,SOLID BLOCKBUSTER FUN !,"Thor Ragnorak is a fun addition to the MCU.While I liked the dark and serious tone of Civil War, this flick with a healthy dose of humour is more in the mould of Guardians of the Galaxy.Both Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo sparkle, revelling and discovering the lighter side of the superheroes - Thor and Hulk. Academy award winner Cate Blanchet is rocking as the sinister sister of Thor, Hela.Kiwi director Taika Waititi comes as a breath of fresh air to the MCU and hopefully would continue to explore new and exciting dimensions along with worthy peers like James Gunn and the Russo brothers."
30 March 2018,radmanart,1,3,10,Outstanding Movie,"WE rented this at the Redbox. Amazing recreation of so many great weird Marvel Comics. When it comes to comic to movies; I love movies taken from weird; off the track comics. The standard everyday doo da comics; do not make great movies. As far as I can tell this movie takes it's plot from comics such as: Planet Hulk, The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #92-105, Thor Vol. 3 #1-12, #600-603, Thor Giant-Sized Finale #1, Contest of Champions #1-10. This is a great movie; despite it being under the total censorship of Disney. There is allot of violence in this movie though. If Disney continues to get rad I am happy to watch movies like this. All movies are fake and I guess the reason Disney likes comics to movies; is because it is make believe, made into make believe."

Love the humour and the characters and the just plain outrageousness of it all.
Its just like Flash Gordon in so many ways!Hardcore fans will probably hate it and I can see their point but it was a real fun rollercoaster ride and thats what cinema was all about - I thought it was lost but this shows its still got heart!Loved all the cameos from the likes of Matt Damon , Dr Strange even pops his head around the door and the pure guts of the director to just go for it - nice one!If you are looking for a movie to bring a smile to your face then this one sure will suffice!"
9 November 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,0,8,9,"""Thor: Ragnarok""- Marvel's Phase Three winning-steak continues with the best entry of the 'Thor' trilogy!","The thing I really loved about ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was its ambition and fearlessness. Something you don't see often in a mainstream Hollywood film these days, especially at this budget level. Yes, even as an enormous fan of Marvel's ever-growing cinematic universe, I'll still admit that often, the films are definitely reliant on recurring motifs and formula. But ""Thor: Ragnarok""? It does everything it can to stand tall and proud, and eschews many of the clichés and conventions you'd expect thanks to its wonderful style and sharp humor. It's up there with the likes of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as one of the studio's most risky and unique endeavors, and it's easily one of my favorite releases in the franchise thus- far!After re-uniting with his treacherous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the god of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds himself in a desperate new scenario... His mighty hammer Mjolnir is destroyed, and he is cast away to a far-off junker planet by the dreaded Hela (Cate Blanchett)- Thor's power hungry long-lost sister, and the goddess of death itself! Now lost and alone on a forsaken world, Thor must work together with Loki and his old friend Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to escape this devious place and save Asgard, along the way contending with the planet's ridiculous and peculiar tyrant the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), and meeting new friends and allies...One of the most obvious and delightful things about the film is that it's a shameless throwback to old-school, 80's sword-and-sorcery epics. From the delightfully reto-styled musical score of composer Mark Mothersbaugh, through director Taika Waititi's wondrously neon- infused visual palette... everything about the film oozes of style and homage, and it's just a blast and a half to behold as a major fan of the fantasy genre. Hearing cheeky synth chords ring in the background as our mighty hero plows through pastel-colored baddies just hits you right in the nostalgic feels, and I couldn't help but have a giant grin across my face the entire runtime.The film is very well-assembled with a sharp script and keen direction. The movie's pacing is fast and loose, with just the right amount of focus placed on each character, and enough development given to the newcomers to bring the audiences up to speed with relative ease. Comedy is infused throughout every scene, but it never feels false and always comes as an organic extension of the story. It's by far the funniest of Marvel's films, but it never detracts from the proceedings. And the film manages the fine balancing act of both serving as a stand-alone tale while also planting the seeds of what is to come in future movies. And that's nothing to sneeze at, as that is very much a huge issue with many of these universe-building films.Waititi's direction is smooth, flowing and incredibly dynamic. He's found a grand approach that takes the best of what came before- the wild energy of Kenneth Branagh's first film and the strange and varied visuals of Alan Taylor's ""The Dark World""- and combines them while also adding his own spin to the material in the form of his insane comedic sensibilities. He helps to evolve the series into something new and exciting with his guidance, and leaves you breathless by the time the credits roll.And of course the cast is just awesome all around. Hemsworth not only continues to own the role of the god of thunder, but is also finally given a lot more time to stretch his comedic chops and show how funny an actor he can be. And I loved it. Hiddleston is a joy as ever as Loki, and it's actually quite nice to see him forced into working alongside Thor again. Their chemistry is strong and they play off of each other quite well. I really enjoyed Blanchett as the villainous Hela, despite the fact she's yet another slightly underdeveloped villain in the Marvel universe. She's clearly having a fun time hamming it up for the camera, and has a wonderfully wicked attitude that you'll just love to hate. Ruffalo also gets a lot of great sequences as well, and it's nice seeing him as a major character in a non-""Avengers"" film- especially now that Hulk has learned how to talk and has a rather interesting personality all his own. Idris Elba, Tessa Thompson and Anthony Hopkins also do well in supporting roles as Thor's various allies. But holy crapola, does Jeff Goldblum steal the show! I refuse to spoil anything, but suffice to say... the Grandmaster is one of the best characters to emerge throughout the Marvel universe, and Goldblum is a revelation!Sure, if you twisted my arm, I might be able to point out a few flaws here and there. But honestly,they didn't have any impact whatsoever on my enjoyment of the film. It's hilarious. It's thrilling. And it's by far the best entry of the stand-alone 'Thor' trilogy. I gotta give it a fantastic 9 out of 10, and give it my highest of recommendations. It's one of the most purely fun films I've seen all year long!"

4 April 2018,charbelelaro,1,3,8,This film is straight out awesome,"Thor Ragnarok directed by Taika Waititi, is the third instalment based on this Marvel character. The prior films have taken a more serious approach in relation to the fictional world based in Asgard. Although this film is a totally fresh, comedic and vibrant take on this significant character. Taika Waititi's style definitely comes through, as this is easily the most hilarious Marvel movie ever made. This film contains a perfect balance of light hearted moments as well as strong intensity which really compels the audience to feel genuine care for the characters. Creating that balance is incredibly difficult, although Thor Ragnarok does it perfectly. This film is straight out awesome. There are action sequences which genuinely blew my mind from awesomeness. Waititi utilises music in such a brave way. Most films don't integrate existing songs into pivotal moments, although it turly pays off with Thor. Everything in this film is so memorable, as it subverts the heavy seriousness of superhero films, creating the most enjoyable cinematic experience of 2017."

3 March 2018,miguelneto-74936,0,2,7,"a movie about Ragnarok may not be fun, but it's still better than the previous Thor movies","Thor Ragnarok is better than the previous films, but this is not quite a merit since the last 2 Thor films are only medium, but Thor: Ragnarok is a good movie, this time it's a comedy movie, it's not like other movies of Marvel that has only jokes in the movies, this is comedy itself and this is clear at the beginning of the film, I was disappointed by this fact, a character like Thor and a story like Ragnarok that is '' just '' the end of the world Nordic can not be that, it has to be a heavy and shocking movie too, but it is not the case, the film has good moments of action, but nothing surprising, sometimes the jokes are well forced, it does not always work, but there are moments that are very funny, the characters in the movie are cool, Hela is an interesting villain, Thor in the movie does not please me, and the Hulk has a cool participation, and Tessa Thompson who does Valkyrie is the character I like the most film, she commands very well, the special effects of the film have to Some problems, but they're good, Thor: Ragnarok is good, but it could have been a lot better.

7 April 2018,chriswebb77,2,3,3,Marvel have turned their movies into comedy!,"It's such a shame to see superhero films being turned into comedies which is what Marvel have done. Yes, I admit I'm a DC fan, I prefer a serious tone with a little light humour every now and then but this third Thor instalment is just the worst, I loved the first movie and The Winter Soldier. But for the first 20 minutes every scene is just a comedy sketch. Unfortunately even Star Wars Episode 8 has started to take this tone too. The problem with too much humour is that it diminishes the threat of the enemy/darkness, and basically turns it into a joke."
3 November 2017,nandidot,2,9,8,A Hilarious and Mighty Movie,"Right from the first scene you know this is a different Thor. Cheeky, colorful, and laced with hilarious dialogue the movie screams fun! The mighty Thor seems to have had no trouble moving on from saving the world with the Avengers. Twice. There's no hidden pain or angst that Tony or Cap are dealing with. He even brushes off a mention of his now ex-girlfriend. It's definitely not a Captain America: Civil War kind of a sequel but more along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy. And if you relish those movies you'll have a blast here as well.The Thor films haven't been the strongest in the Marvel Universe. The first two, while fun, were certainly not as memorable as other great Marvel outings. A quick haircut and a giant heaping of humor later we have Thor 2.0. Voila! No spoilers here but as we saw in the trailer even his hammer gets a new lookif you can call it that. Asgard, Thor's home, is under the control of the powerful Hela as he is captured and sold off to the Grandmaster (a terrific Jeff Goldblum) who forces him to fight his all mighty champion. And who might that be? Well we already know it's the Hulk. Taking on his 'friend from work' while worrying about his planet being destroyed Thor has a lot on his plate but as he casually says it's always a mess yet it ends up working out.Taika Waititi has done a bang on job revamping Thor and making it into an entertainment spectacle. From the graphics and costumes to the never ending laughs (Revengers lol) it's a rollicking ride. Chris Hemsworth lets his hair down (yes, yes, it does get chopped off) and his comic timing fly. He's endearing in the best way and he knows it. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is pretty consistent as usual. I have to point out his reaction to the Hulk which brings the house down. Moments like that remind me how fun it is to have this connected universe. I really enjoyed Mark Ruffalo in both his forms. The Hulk is given a ton of personality, much more than we've seen previously, and Bruce is such a likable guy. Tessa Thompson as the drinking, fighting Valkyrie does a fine job kicking ass. And it's a treat to watch Cate Blanchett playing the big bad Hela. Her power and general villainy is oh so fun! I willsay that I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming a tad more earlier this year and the Cap/Iron Man showdown was more my jam but this is still a solid outing that holds its own. Marvel has added a new layer to their movies recently. Characters flow in and out of stories and worlds leading to some superb cameos. There's bonding and then there's fighting but seeing superheroes together always gets fans excited. We're leading up to Infinity War. The stage is set and I can't wait!https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/"

10 June 2021,Ecclestria,6,19,2,Absolutely terrible,"A terrible cringe-fest with bad music and juvenile humor.I'm going through the Thor movies back to back on Disney, and the inferiority of this movie compared to the previous two is very obvious. The first two films seem like they were made for the entire family to enjoy: mum, dad and the kids. This one is just for the kids. It's crass, it's camp, it's a joke.The soundtrack is tacky, the humor is embarrassing, the main characters have lost their dignity.The storyline strayed too far from reality, there is very little of Earth-life shown, and the relationships that Thor developed there previously have been completely discarded.Costumes and set design - bad. Especially on that trash planet. I know they were going for an 80s feel, but trust me as a child of the 80s, this turned out cringe. Not to mention the horrid 80s-inspired music which abysmally failed to capture the 80s sound.The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is for the great actors involved including Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum (even though the director didn't seem to know what to do with him and the only direction he seems to have been given is to camp it up). Blanchett is a great actress, yet she is wooden and unconvincing here.Which brings me to the directing, it's bad. Bring back Branagh!"
2 November 2017,OlieRendch,1,4,7,"Really funny if sometimes to its detriment, but certainly had me laughing.","The Thor films have been kind of average so far; can a quirky New Zealander change all that?Thor: Ragnarok is the third film in its own series and Thor's fifth appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. This time it's directed by Taika Watiti and also features the Hulk as a main character. For starters I'd like to say I love Taikia's work; his film Hunt for the Wilderpeople is hilarious to me and any interview you watch of his is a joy to behold. He has a very unique style of film so I can see why Marvel chose him to inject some energy and humor into this series. And he does do that. Ragnarok is the most entertained I've been while watching a Thor movie but it's not without its problems.Story-wise, there is a very quick set-up. You can tell that Taika and producer Kevin Feige wanted to completely dismantle what had been built up in the previous Thor films. I can understand why they wanted to do that but just seeing mythology, characters, and arcs that have been established since 2011 be wiped away or brushed under the carpet was a little disheartening, and this was all during the first act. It was very quick and we were going from scene to scene and location to location very quickly mopping up old plot threads and setting up what this movie was going to be. Once that had happened, and Thor was on the planet Sakar, it became more enjoyable for me. The rest of the movie showcased Taika's style of humor perfectly and had me laughing out loud plenty of times. It did seem a bit like two films at times with one set on Sakar and the other on Asgard as the story kept flipping from one to the other but I was entertained enough with the characters.Chris Hemsworth has always played Thor brilliantly and we get to see a lot more of his comedic talent here. Mark Ruffalo is always a highlight of any film for me and seeing him here was great both as Banner and the Hulk experiencing this mad Universe. Tom Hiddleston's Loki, of course, appears again and although the character has perhaps lost some of his popularity since everybody loved him in The Avengers, I enjoyed seeing him because I like Tom Hiddleston as an actor. Two new characters I absolutely loved in this film though, were Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster who is hilarious; Goldblum barely has to act, his own wacky charisma comes through perfectly. And Korg, voiced by Taika Watiti himself had some of the best lines. I'd definitely say the characters were the best part of this film for me.In the end, I'd say I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok. The story is pretty basic and some of the green-screen wasn't great during the re-shoots but I loved the aesthetic and the characters. I laughed a lot too even though I felt some of the emotional beats were lost due to quick jokes. I still look forward to following Taika's work and I'm looking forward to seeing where the character of Thor himself is taken too."
6 November 2017,ajith-18247,7,17,10,Just Amazing,"The 'Best' Marvel movie made yet. Thor and Hulk cameo was just awesome. Hulk is shown in a much lighter and funnier manner in this movie compared to others where he was just serious, angry and smashing everything. Love this Hulk better than the old one. Hela was just awesome. A villain like this should be more oftenly used in movies. where 2 avengers including Valkyrie cannot defeat her and it takes the obliteration on Asgard to defeat her. Just Amazing Movie. Loved it so much, i have watched it twice."
4 November 2017,bankofmarquis,0,6,8,A good time at the Cineplex,"Of all the Marvel properties put upon screen thus far, the THOR franchise was one that I was the least connected with.  I think that is because it is set on an alien world and was Shakespearean in scope and style and was so earnest and serious in it's approach.All that has changed with the newest entry in this series, THOR:RAGNAROK.  While we return to the Shakespearean alien world and people, the mood has lightened substantially and Director Taiki Waititi (HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) has brought his substantial comedic chops to a franchise that desperately needed to ""lighten up"".And, from the start, lighten up is what THOR: RAGNAROK does.  Taking a page from the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY playbook, THOR:RAGNAROK starts out on a comedic tone and places it's tongue firmly in it's cheek for the entire film.Not to say there isn't serious moments and action big action set pieces, just the contrary.  The comedy helps lighten the mood, so when a serious moment hits, it is much more impactfull.As for the cast, Chris Hemsworth has the role of Thor down pat and he (and his muscles) control the screen anytime he is on it.  Tom Hiddleston, as Thor's brother Loki, has tremendous screen chemistry  with Hemsworth, and he also has his role down pat.  Add to them newcomer (at least to this series) Tessa Thompson as Valkerie and a certain large, green HULK and we have the makings of a fun team.As the villain, Cate Blanchett was born to play Hela - the goddess of death.  She struts onto the screen with her signature smirk and you know she is in control and Thor has his hands full - which he does.  Aiding her is a reluctant henchman played by the always good Karl Urban and Idris Elba reprises his role as Helmdal while Sir Anthony Hopkins shows up, briefly, as Odin.  All welcome sights on screen.There also is a fun cameo from another member of the Marvel Universe (though I will not name this character).  Suffice it to say, it was fun to see this character.And, finally, there is Jeff Goldblum as THE GRANDMASTER.  It's about time that someone discovered a role that Goldblum can go ""full Goldblum"" on - and they finally did.  He is a highlight of this film and I, for one, would be thrilled if the spoken about spin off featuring THE GRANDMASTER and Benicio Del Toro's THE COLLECTOR takes shape.Finally, special notice needs to be made for the rock creature, Korg (voiced by Director Waititi) - he becomes the heart and soul of this film in his all too brief appearances on screen.All in all, a good time at the movies.  Check out THOR:RAGNAROK, you'll have a fun time.Letter Grade:  A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

New characters like Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson were also good.Cate Blanchett as the villain Hela was good and I thought she gave a menacing feel to the character. Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster was fine, I just thought they could have used him more.The action scenes were fun, and the characters were funny when given the right dialogue. When there are serious and/or touching moments the movie does it well.Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is a fun addition to the solo Thor movies."
3 November 2017,Anurag-Shetty,0,8,10,Thor is back & he's better than ever.,"Thor: Ragnarok continues with the adventures of the god of thunder, Thor(Chris Hemsworth). After the events of Thor(2011), The Avengers(2012), Thor: The Dark World(2013) & Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015), Thor finds himself protecting the Nine Realms. He soon learns that Asgard faces Ragnarok, which is the destruction of Asgard as we know it. Now, it is up to Thor to do everything in his power to stop Hela(Cate Blanchett) the goddess of death, from causing Ragnarok. Thor: Ragnarok is a mind blowing film. Director Taika Waititi has brought his own unique brand of humor to the Thor franchise. The result is a hilarious & action-packed movie, from start to finish. Don't worry though. None of the jokes feel forced. Also, there are quite a few intense scenes. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are incredible. The 3D is eye-popping. The performances are the highlight of the film. Chris Hemsworth is spectacular as Thor. Hemsworth effortlessly balances his serious & comedic scenes. Tom Hiddleston is brilliant as Loki. Cate Blanchett is perfect as Hela. Blanchett portrays the first female Marvel Cinematic Universe villain, with ease & panache. Idris Elba is good as Heimdall. Jeff Goldblum is hysterical as the Grandmaster. Tessa Thompson is superb as Valkyrie. Karl Urban is impressive as Skurge. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. The camaraderie among Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Thompson & Ruffalo, is delightful to witness. Anthony Hopkins is awesome as Odin. Benedict Cumberbatch is hilarious in his cameo, as Doctor Strange. Taika Waititi is fantastic as Korg. The supporting cast is great. Thor: Ragnarok is a must watch for everyone. Another masterpiece from the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
21 May 2022,claire_turner,5,9,1,Mindless dribble,"I'm watching the MCU in chronological order, the original and second Thor movies were stand out favourites so far. And then this happened.What the actual **** did they do to this movie?The loose storyline could have been told within half an hour, added character appearances that didnt even need to be there (doctor strange??), flaws and plot holes left right and centre, and the comic relief...dont even get me started on the wasteful tactless unfunny attempt at humour smashed and dragged into Every. Single. Scene.It made it almost unwatchable.How are people rating this movie as good? The stunts arent even good, everything is CGI. And badly done at that. Hulk anyone?I actually feel bad for the usually great actors having to make this garbage. They would have been embarrassed the whole way through."
27 May 2019,articaldog,4,10,10,Unique and perfect,"This movie is probably the most underrated movie I can think of.
It really stands alone with it's unique ambiance and esthetics.All the actors are delightfulThe bit about Loki turning into a snake was the biggest laugh I got in a movie that I can remember.It's really too bad it got overshadowed by other movies for the wrong reasons, because this work of art blows them out of the water like an Endgame Thor doing a cannon ball in a kiddie pool."
3 November 2017,amirmustafaa,1,4,7,This Movie is Fun. What Else can I Say?,"This is another enjoyable movie from marvel. What is there to say at this point? Marvel has its formula perfected. This movie is exactly what you thought it was going to be, a fun yet predictable marvel movie. With that being said, this an above average marvel film. The characters are enjoyable, the score is great, and it looks visually better than most movies marvel has released. At this point, Marvel knows what they're doing. Their formula is fail proof, and this movie is no exception."
5 April 2018,juliankennedy23,0,3,10,Third time is a charm.,"Thor: Ragnarok: After the last film Left Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in charge of Asgard disguised as his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) whom he trapped on earth, Thor comes home to set things right. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) then finds out he has an older sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) who is the vying for the throne. Can Thor stop the usurper, take his place as the rightful heir and save Asgard from Ragnarok a prophesied destruction of both Asgard and all the old gods?The Good: Pretty much everything. Looking at the above synopsis one can easily imagine a dour grey family drama with lightning. (Heck one doesn't have to imagine it just watch Thor the Dark World again.) Instead, we have a joyful, colorful action-packed film that is easily the most fun I have had watching a movie in a long time. It is pure joy. Too many things are perfect but a shout out to the use of Led Zepplin's Immigrant Song and director Taika Waititi as super friendly rock monster Korg.The Bad: Nothing. Seriously nothing. Okay fine the use of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Pure Imagination is a little on the nose. There is also a realization while watching that not enough films have Jeff Goldblum in them... does that count as a negative?In Conclusion: Thor Ragnarok is simply the most fun I had at the movies this year. Dunkirk is a slightly better film and there are certainly more ""important"" films out there but this was pure joy. Imagine a comic book movie that felt like reading a comic book. What will they think of next?"
2 January 2019,kingwellah,3,6,4,Not what I was expecting,I thought this was going to be a serious movie I was wrong the visuals are great but too much comedy for Me.
5 November 2017,parleon-thedon,1,4,8,The Best Thor Movie!,"Thor: Ragnarok is the third installment in the Thor solo film series. Thor fights his deadliest adversary yet, Hela, an evil woman who's determined to conquer Thor's home world of Asgard.Independent film director Taika Waititi, Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), What We Do in the Shadows (2014), Thor: Ragnarok (2017) - The Best Thor Film.The only negative thing I can say about Taika Waititi as the director of Thor 3, he needs to polish the bloated CGI-heavy action scenes, however, I believe that's more on Marvel Studio's head than anything else.When one character is fighting swarms of oncoming enemies (in this movie) it feels forced and faked for the most part. But, during the one-one battles (mostly Hulk vs. Thor) those fights are exciting and they bring out the inner child in me.Also, Marvel Studio's needs to tone it down with the comedy. There's nothing wrong with laughing every now and then, but when some of the comedic bits come off as a bad 3 stooges gag... then we need to tone it down with the jokes.Thor was always my least favorite Avenger, the bottom of the barrel, but this film has given me a new respect for Thor, and now he's my number two guy... Hulk's my number one.Hulk is great here. I like what Marvel did with the character, in this film, they take him in a slightly new direction, and it works.Hela is an okay villain, Marvel still has a bad villain problem. Taika Waititi tries to make Hela look strong, but it comes off as rushed and forced. Taking out swarms of enemies is good for the character and it proves that they are strong, but if I can barely see what's happening on screen, then that falls on the directors head. Hela was cool, but they should've given her more to work with.The beginning of the movie was bland and boring, the middle section was the most interesting, and the finale was better than the beginning, but it wasn't as exciting as the middle.Thor Ragnarok is a good movie, I had fun with it. Besides the small problems I had with the film, I still ended up having a good time.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tan5c72MIc"
19 July 2019,Abranth-d,1,4,10,Waititi all the way !,"Here's my review of Thor :Ragnarok . So , Chris Haemsworth is back once again to wield the hammer. Despite being a sequel to the god awful ""dark world"" this movie blew me away , there was not a single dull moment in this movie , very fast phased with a really good soundtrack that went with it , especially lord Zeppelins immigrant . This movie took in so many new characters and gave them the right screen time . No matter how cool marvel movies are , the villains are not too challenging , but Kate blanchet as Hela was beast. Probably the best villain the MCU has to offer. Loki has a lot of character development in this movie and it hit it right. Hulk has a pretty good amount of screen time and how they pulled of the jekyl and Hyde thing was pretty cool especially how they made hulk talk. Now putting everything aside , the one liners in this movie are perfectly placed and they are too funny , like the hold your tummy and laugh kind of ones. If the one liners weren't placed right , this movie would've looked like a spoof , but nah , it nailed it.Thor ragnarok is an absolute treat . I'm not saying this cause I'm into superheroes , its just that good of a movie . And is definitely worth watching on imax and is inarguably the best superhero movie of 2017 , right beside wonder woman.In the end , Thor is not just philosophy convos with Odin , its the perfect entertainer with top notch CGI , crunching 80 s music , a big green monster , quotable dialogue and the perfect setup to infinity war. Can't believe I typed so much ... I guess its the power of lightning and lord Zeppelins immigrant song stuck in my head."
22 December 2021,stephen-kaelb,7,15,2,It was so gaggy I was sure the director is Jar Jar Abrams,"But according to the credits apparently not! OK!!It was a joke, stupid and lame and also working overtime for character assassination.Hey 2 stars because the chick is not modern American: fat and inked."
13 July 2022,isaacochoterena,0,0,7,Better story than in the previous movies,"In this third installment, the script improves a lot as the story is more developed and by giving a special moment for each character.What I don't like about this story is that it spends a lot of time on the part where Thor is on another planet and leaves very little time for the battle against the antagonist, because that part is magnificent, the director lets each character shine a little bit in that fight, also the visual aspect of that is very surprising. The character development is simple but it is present, I love the personality of Cate Blanchett's character, as well as her interpretation, the new characters are also interesting and the ones we already knew have an important evolution. The humor of the film seems to me very silly and unnecessary most of the time, I also did not like that the use of green screen is very obvious at various times, taking away the credibility of the film.Still, I think it's an enjoyable and entertaining movie, in my opinion it's the best of the trilogy, the director does a good job of changing the tone of the other two movies about the character, also in this one the visual effects improve."
8 July 2018,rob-lentini,1,3,7,Korg !!!!!!,"This is the best of the Thor movies and one of Marvels most solid efforts. Lots of action and humour. Both Thor & Hulk are great and work well together. Really liked Korg , a very funny character who I'd like to see more of. A typical hero movie but still worth watching."
28 October 2017,stevenclayalcander,3,11,6,"Funny and enjoyable movie, but expect much better !","To be honest, I really satisfied after watching this movie because it is really fun, funny, and brings joy to the audience. They succeed again at making superhero movie with comedy style like Deadpool or Guardian of Galaxy. The jokes are good, and with experienced and well known actor like Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Rufallo, and Idris Elba make this movie even better !Marvel did the right decision to make this movie into comedy, because it makes this movie a lot more fresh and interesting to watch. Many people can enjoy this film and will make you feel happy till the end of the day !But, I think at some point Thor Ragnarok is lacking many of important point. The plot seems decent with nothing special in the story, lacking some emotional touch and too many CGI effect involved sometimes make the movie kinda too unrealistic. And I feel a little disappointed with nothing special involved Loki. Loki is somehow that makes Thor movie and Avenger movie more interesting, with his sneaky tricky style sometimes pick a good side or bad side. At last, with the title Ragnarok that means the big war that can brings doom, I expect they can make this movie much better, not only some funny comedy movie !"

14 September 2018,rolandjordaan2,1,3,8,Thor: Ragnarok - Spoiler Free Review,"I've always been a fan of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, but not so much of the actual Thor movies; don't get me wrong, I always thought they were watchable, but ultimately rather unmemorable movies: until now. I actually really enjoyed this third film in the Thor franchise; the film gripped me straight away with its truly great opening scene and following that was just a fun-filled ride to its explosive climax. Sure it's not perfect, some scenes do drag a bit and several jokes really fall flat, but none of that is enough to stop this from being one hell of a fun movie. Several new characters are introduced and they all fit in well with the cast of familiar faces, all who seem to be having a great time with this. Summed up, great characters, some really funny scenes, an awesome soundtrack and action scenes that are filmed superbly actually make this one of my favourite Marvel movies to date."

3 November 2019,freewillyfan,1,5,9,Thor Ragnarok,Thor Ragnarok is a huge step up from the first two Thor movies. This one is less serious and is in my opinion the funniest film in the MCU. The CGI is good in this and the villain is good. Thor and Loki are great and there are some great new additions in this movie. The action is great and I loved the final act and the use of the immigrant song in the film. This was a very fresh entry in the MCU and one of my favourites.9.2/10
25 January 2022,benibkill,2,9,9,Thor is funny?,"I absolutely loved this movie. The comedy was simply unmatched and I really liked all the jokes. Taika Waititi pumped life into the Thor franchise, and he is not done. Sure, it might seem like a big change at first. But everyone likes Thor in a funny way. I also really liked Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk. They all had a funny part in this film. The Grandmaster was also truly hilarious. I really liked Hela as a villain. She had a personal connection to Thor, without making it feel too forced. Doctor Strange had a cameo, and it was great. Of course, not everything was perfect. Sometimes the emotional and traumatic moments were overshadowed by unnecessary comedy and jokes. Overall, I would say, that this movie is an absolute blast with great comedy, action and cast."
12 July 2018,erikacunanan29,1,3,9,Such a funny movie.,"MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.comI love this movie. I watched this in the cinema with my family and we could not stop laughing.

Plotwise, I think it should have focused more on Hela and the fight."

27 January 2018,yelerz,3,5,6,A Parody,"Its a high budget film so no issues with the cinema effects and cinematography. This movie is categorized as an action adventure-comedy , so heads up on that. so don't expect this to be a Captain America movie. With all the muscles and action characters in this movie, its really a comedy show and at times its like a parody (seriously!), but its funny. 
But I'd really want it to be more of a serious action film."
3 November 2017,tyson-hunsaker,1,5,8,A fun and high energy ride.,"""Thor Ragnarok"" is the newest addition to the MCU and the third installment of the Thor franchise. Being one of the closest lead ups to Infinity Wars, a lot is riding on the success of this film. With recent MCU films coming in to deliver a joke rather than a compelling story with somewhere to go, ""Thor Ragnarok"" falls into similar territory by sacrificing some drama with jokes. The biggest difference in this film is the joke is actually good.Director Taika Waititi has said more than half the film's dialogue is improvised which makes some genuinely hilarious moments where you wouldn't expect them. In many cases, this gives the movie the most energy and laughs, in other spots, it makes for some nonsensical and outrageous dialogue. This can make character progression feel inconsistent but the movie's pacing never allows you to revel in the mistakes. It's wonderfully paced and edited with no moment of drag or boredom. Visual effects were astonishingly better than what the trailer had to offer. Props should be given to the crew for creating an impressive visual presentation with CGI, production design, and costumes with makeup. None of those feel out of place. What felt fresh about ""Thor Ragnarok"" was the plot and character story of Thor himself. This is the first time, since the first Thor, that we see a real story and change for the character. While side characters didn't get worthy enough treatment, Thor himself was at least taken care of. Cate Blanchet as Hella did a solid job given her small role and lack of depth. Tom Hiddleston continues to nail it as Loki even though is flat character may feel stagnant and uninteresting and frankly, unnecessary to the plot. The biggest problems with ""Thor Ragnarok"" are tonal. When powerful and emotional notes could be hit, the filmmakers tend to shove jokes in which kill the emotional impact and just don't land well. This could get tiring for some audience members and for others, it could be the lifeline of the film entirely. Overall, ""Thor Ragnarok"" may be the best MCU film this year, It's fun, energetic, and quite intense. While it doesn't tap new ground or really shake the world of comic book filmmaking, it's undeniably fun and enjoyable to watch from start to finish."
3 April 2019,totalpcamazon,4,12,1,Would've been a far more interesting film had they gone with the original title,"This could've been a much more interesting movie had they titled it Thor: Fraggle Rock. As it stands, another lame boring Stupor Hero flick. (yawn)"
20 November 2017,domonkos-horvath,2,5,6,A better Guardians of the Galaxy than Guardians of the Galaxy. Shame it shouldn't be.,"Main characters are dying left and right, and you just can't give a damn no matter how hard you try, because they are dying in a CGI buffed stand-up comedy. Even Guardians of the Galaxy knew when to take a darker tone if it needed to, this movie is just an action flick that lacks all seriousness and emotional impact from the first minute to the last. This movie wouldn't have looked or felt any different if they had replaced Chris Hemsworth with Aziz Ansari. All of it feels very out of place.I give it six stars only because all those elements the comedy runs into the ground are actually good, and would need no change at all if this was an actual, serious movie about the end times of Asgard. The characters have depth, their motives are believable, they all have their little backstories that make the main plot that much more colorful.This could have been the best Marvel movie of recent years if it wouldn't have been designed to be one big out of character superhero comedy."

We the fans gave them our hard earned money to begin with and this is how they treat us: they think ""ok we've locked the fans, they're gonna pay to watch the crap anyway so let's make something generic without a plot but with lots of explosions and teenagers' dick jokes to attract a different, lower level of fanbase to suck their money off"".

3 November 2017,trimblair,0,10,10,Top Marvel movie to date! SOOO GOOD!,"OK, as an old fan-boy who owns every superhero movie ever made and a stack of comics in my closet, I have always thought the first IRON MAN movie was sheer perfection. This THOR: RAGNAROK comes close to that -- it was so good from opening scene to closing credits that I was blown away. I saw this in IMAX-3D with a packed house of fellow fans on opening night and we were blown away. There was hooping and hollering and clapping. It was an experience that I will not soon forget. They finally figured out that fans don't want a serious, political superhero -- we want fun! WELL DONE, Marvel! I'll be buying the DVD for more deleted scenes and fun."
26 April 2018,lyzott,2,3,10,One of the only movies you could say the third one was the best.,"I've personally never been a fan of the all-serious Thor, as someone who appreciates a good (and bad) joke. 
This third movie has definitely raised Thor up on my favourites list! I know that a lot of people were iffy about the comedy and didn't like it, but I honestly thought it was brilliant. 
I'm a sucker for comedy, especially when some of the dumbest jokes are coming out of the mouths of gods and powerful characters. Taika Waititi (Director/Korg) really made Marvel fresh and the cast enjoyed themselves, which was exactly his plan. The Kiwi style comedy and references in it really hit close to home and made the movie all the more enjoyable and connectable. 
Definitely worth the money and time. Puts a whole new take on superhero movies, best superhero movie of 2017. Can't wait for Infinity War and Taika Waititi's next works."

24 August 2018,kristoffer-46,2,7,9,Thor at his best!,"Thor: Ragnarök is a movie whom takes itself a little less seriously than many other marvel movies. Is this bad? No. On the contrary this is good!Thor: Ragnarök delivers a story filled with adventure, action and comedy
Directed by the very talented Taika Waititi and it does so in a marvelous way
that keeps you entertained from the starting line to the finish line. The character Thor
continues to be developed in this story and the actor Chris Hemsworth whom portrays him here gets to be a lighter and more comedy focused version of the character. And the result? Highly entertaining!Chris Hemsworth gets to show in Thor: Ragnarök that he is not only 
An actor whom can play scenes with drama and action but also scenes with 
Whom are largely comedy focused.
 
The cast of Thor: Ragnarök was amazing and the movie knew when to be funny and when to be serious, and every scene was interesting to watch. I for one found this movie to be highly entertaining from start to finish.Do i recommend it? Yes!Very good!"

Here, we see the emotional and psychological impact of our hero in a meaningful way!I watched Thor 3 in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see Thor and Hulk fight! The 3D was unnecessary, though.I felt it was a refreshing take on the superhero genre and here it still applies. We always get that story where we find out the reason behind why a hero takes the path again. We've seen it many times with the likes of Batman, Spider-man, etc. but here we see this again in a different manner. This is the main point in this movie and really make you root for the superhero!What's also great here is the director of Green Lantern and story writers are not dwindling on too much on what happened in Thor: The Dark World and the story is progressing using the theme to Thor & Avenger's over the trilogy's second installment.Verdict: The important lesson is to get back up again, no matter how much you lost! My digital score: 7.5/10 More luck for Marvel's next outing!"
19 November 2017,jeannefrancoise,1,8,9,A Wow Ragnarok!,"Yes I am really really satisfied after watching Thor: Ragnarok. Do not blame me if at first this movie is not my priority, because look at the poster, man. The combination of color is so childish and too colorful to be considered as a superhero movie. Okay so I like this movie so much!! I can see a new-haired style of Thor, new family relationship with his brother Loki, and what happens after a dark energy coming up to Asgard. The story is full of surprises, actions from some Avengers heroes that appeared in some fun way, and of course unpredictable ending. The plot is not just the plot, but it gives the complete history of how Thor can be a superhero for Asgard and for what he stands. Besides, the character of the movie are developing in such way they meet each other, coincidentally, or planned. This is what makes you will stay awake from the beginning until the end. Thor: Ragnarok is not just about the battle of Ragnarok, but also the battle of every battle that superhero may die for it: The extinction of their people and how every relation could be pure again with patience and love. Let's see how Thor survive and what makes his stronger, even he lost his valuable thing, if you know what I mean :)"

12 July 2022,AscendeSuperius,0,0,7,Best Thor thus far,"With well placed humour, lovable characters and even another Avenger, what's not to love? While the first 2 were very mediocre, this was one that truly shined. It has a good mix of everything that makes a good marvel film. It's action packed without it being overbearing while staying emotional."
19 January 2022,matveeva-94718,1,2,7,Ample Amounts of Comedy and Action,"This movie begins with ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) having been captured by a giant demon named ""Surtur"" (a CGI with the voice of Clancy Brown) who intends to kill him very soon. But before doing this Surtur tells Thor that his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) has mysteriously abandoned Asgard which will now allow him to fulfill the prophecy known as Ragnorok and thereby entirely destroy that vaunted realm. Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter ""Hela"" (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was."
3 November 2017,bodhi-13262,1,5,8,"All hail the ""Lord"" of Thunder!","Asgard's time has finally come as 'Thor: Ragnarok' not only completes its trilogy, but unleashes destructive entertainment and proves to be the biggest game changer in the MCU thus far.1. Following the events of 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to Asgard after his failed quest to locate the infinity stones. Learning that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is still alive, he also discovers that Hela (Cate Blanchett) the Goddess of Death has come to claim the throne and lay siege to the peaceful realm. When both brothers are isolated on the scavenging planet of Sakaar, Thor must enlist the help of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in order to save Asgard and its people from Hela's rule. Though not the most original plot, the fall of a hero and his quest for redemption is always fun to see. MARVEL continuously has a knack for telling the simplest of stories in the most entertaining way, and this is no different.2. Having never been a fan of the first two films, this is indeed the best of the bunch. Not only is it funny and action-packed, but also the most visually stunning film MARVEL have made so far. Ever since 2014, most audiences have been hung up on the comedic and unique style of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and now I can safely say that 'Thor Ragnarok' is better in every way to those films. For a director handling a film of this scale for the first time, Taika Waititi is no short of a pro. He clearly implements his own style here while removing the dark tones of the first two and replacing it with a more lively and upbeat setting. Waititi's choice of cinematography and production design is nothing short of breathtaking. 3. I never thought portraying the character of Thor showcased Chris Hemsworth's acting ability to the fullest extent, but I was glad to be proved wrong this time. Hemsworth shows a different side to his character ranging from emotions of fear to exceptional humor. The chemistry between both he and Ruffalo lends to some of the more funnier parts of the film. Jeff Goldblum as 'Grandmaster' heightens the comedy aspect while Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie showcases a more serious tone. And of course, how could we forget the ladies' favorite, Loki himself. Tom Hiddleston can do no wrong as he never loses the charm, charisma and overall mischievous nature of Loki. On another unrelated note, Scarlett Johansson needs to move over because Cate Blanchett sizzles the screen in her skin-tight costume as the unbelievably sexy Hela;)4. If I had any problems, the first would be that some of the characters felt underused. Idris Elba returns as Heimdall, but only serves as a single purpose to the plot. Worst of all, Karl Urban as Skurge could well have been non-existent. We all know Urban is a good actor, but he literally has nothing to do but stand next to Cate Blanchett and look intimidating. Only at the very tail-end of the film does he actually attempt to do something, but that's over in the blink of an eye. Other CGI characters (seen in the trailers) such as Korg, Fenris Wolf and Surter all makes appearances in this film, but I won't say what their involvement in the plot is since this is a spoiler free review. Other than a slight overuse of the 80s soundtrack, this is an all together/well crafted film.Although not the best MCU film, it is by far the best outer-earth one. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' still ranks as the best superhero and MARVEL flick of the year, but this is a close second. Be sure to stick around for the first post-credit scene at least. While short, it sets up 'Infinity War' more than any other film in this phase. The Guardians may have a talking raccoon on their side, but in the words of Tony Stark, ""We have a Hulk!"""

But the soundtrack blew it away.The action sequences were totally epic, but once again, the soundtrack blew it away!The sense of humor was actually funny, but sometimes there was no reason to say some jokes, they worked with me and made me laugh though, there was no reason for Thor to say a joke like every minute!The length was pretty good, for such a movie.. maybe less was going to be better!The voice of Korg was totally unfitting and bad!!Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was less than fine.. just like every Marvel movie, they choose the wrong people to act in their movies, and as a result, the performance is always bad!The CGI was not that good, actually! Just like every MCU movie!All of that made Thor: Ragnarok away to be a decent MCU movie!Because of five of the cast (Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston , Mark Ruffalo, Idris Elba and Cate Blanchett) and tthe great story, I'm gonna give it an 8/10!"

27 June 2022,Patirck,0,0,7,Best Thor movie yet,"When ""Thor: Ragnarok"" came out in theaters I was 12 or 13 years old and really enjoyed the movie. I still do enjoy the film don't get me wrong but I don't think it's the best mcu film like I previously did for me it's a little too goofy. The pervious Thor movies (especially dark world) were criticized for being ""too serious"" and I do think changing directors was a great idea for the Thor franchise. Taika Waititi is a great director with a good sense of humor for directing these silly lighthearted mcu movies. I enjoyed Thor's arc in this film and this movie probably has the best Stan Lee cameo ever. I also enjoyed the bromance between Thor and Hulk. Hella was a mid villan."
26 October 2017,zkleong,12,29,7,Doesn't live up to its hype,"The cinematographic and actors are awesome! Hela is the best villain MCU ever had! She's so powerful and cool, she managed to make you fall in love with her.Despite that, the trailer is so much better than the movie. The plot is cliché and somehow similar to Spiderman: Homecoming. The movie has too many lame and expected jokes."

They took everything that's been missing in the first two films and put it together and here we are - that's how Ragnarok was born.

The change was well needed, the humor to balance out all the dark events that happen in this film.

13 November 2017,sebastiansallingkierkegaard,1,4,8,Thor: Ragnarok review,"Thor: Ragnarok is the perfect Thor movie. It is very different from ""Thor"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"", but is that bad? In this case, no. When i saw the first two i thought the critics were wrong. This was really some good adaptations of Marvel and Nordic metrology. The mix of our world and Asgard. But this movie has also got a science fiction world called ""Saakar"". Jeff Goldblum does a decent job of playing The grandmaster. Mark Ruffalo is just amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth, great humor and the old God of Thunder we know. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Hela. The visuals are amazing, but the music is kind of annoying if you ask me. Mark Mothersbaugh is not the most known film composer, but these rock songs and the synthesizer music in Saakar is just missing the magic of the first too. I really wanted to hear some of the themes from ""Thor: The Dark World"" by Brian Tyler. But overall, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is totally worth your time!"
28 December 2021,pasuto,2,6,10,The best Thor movie,Ragnorock is the best Thor movie as it has all the three siblings and we got to know deeper about their powers.And yeah it's kinda fault of Odin which led to the split otherwise the Odinsons would have defeated Thanos single handedly.

28 August 2019,Poseidxn,5,14,9,A Breath of fresh air for Thor,"This is by far the best of the three Thor movies, Taika Watiti's direction meshed with the Guardians aesthetic makes for a fun ride of comedy, action and storytelling! This was certainly the right direction to take Thor's character in my opinion."
8 August 2018,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,1,5,8,A fun sequel,"Directed by Taika Waititi it takes place a few years after Avengers Age of Ultron. After a long hiatus away Thor returns back to Asgard only to find out step brother Loki staged his own death to rule Asgard in the form of his father Odin. Meanwhile Odin has been living his last days on Earth as a recluse. From the help of Doctor Strange Thor eventually finds him to discover he has an evil sister more powerful than himself. Naturally she wants to rule Asgard and beats Thor and Loki by casting them out to a waste planet and then singlehandedly takes out an army. It's reminiscent of films like The Running Man and Flash Gordon. The cinematography by Javier Agurresarobe looks stunning full of bright colours and textures. It's 
 filled so many eye popping visuals from the retro 80s look of the waste planet Sakaar down to the exciting crowd pleasing action scenes. The music score by Mark Mothersbaugh also has a cool 80s synth vibe to it and it's one you will probably want to download on iTunes. Chris Hemsworth looks to be having the most fun with the role so does Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo. None of the actors look bored and it's probably down to director Waititi's wacky energy which also shows on the film. Tessa Thompson plays Valkarie and she is also a great addition to the series complete with an interesting backstory. Writers Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle bring so many fresh ideas to the film - It doesn't just feel like a bland rehash like the last Thor film and it's full of a few surprises along the way. We finally see Thor's true potential showing him to be the most powerful Avenger even without his hammer. There isn't many problems with it really. There are only a few minor complaints. It's very lighthearted considering its serious themes like death, defeat and the apocalypse. There are some hilarious moments throughout but sometimes they feel a little bit overblown as they can often affect the dramatic scenes. Some of the CGI looks cheap and Cate Blanchett as the villain (although great) is a little bit hammy sometimes. Overall though it's a thoroughly enjoyable film that never slows down. There is never a dull moment and the action scenes are so entertaining. The constant gags are not for everyone but they oddly work the majority of the time. And Jeff Goldlum plays the best Jeff Goldlum yet."
4 November 2017,M_Exchange,1,10,9,The funniest comic book movie to date.,"I feel like this movie is everything that the last ""Guardians"" movie wanted to be. Whereas in the last two Thor movies the script relied on Kat Dennings to provide comedic relief and she mostly failed (sorry, Kat) almost all of the actors in this film had great comedic timing and cadence. It completely erases the brutal memory of the last Thor movie from my mind.Even its ending is fairly nontraditional and not what what you're expecting from such an irreverent (for the most part) movie. I LOVE it."

17 November 2017,AudreyAwesome,2,6,8,"Met Expectations and In Some Ways, Exceeded Them","I will just come out and say that I do ""like"" Marvel movies, but I don't particularly love them. I really didn't care for the first Avengers movie and there are some other ones that just downright are not good. I prefer the DCEU (DC movies), but I suppose I appreciate both.This movie, however, really was great! To compare, I really enjoyed Captain America Civil War and Doctor Strange. Those are top 10 Marvel movies worthy. However, this year, I didn't really care for Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Spiderman Homecoming. Thor Ragnarok blew those movies away and basically made them look like garbage.In every way, Thor Ragnarok is one of the best Marvel movies for several reasons:1. The storyline. While it may seem simple, it really is a great story. They included the planet hulk storyline which adds to it and continues what happened with Age of Ultron. It also includes what happened with Asgard and the ending is very fitting.2. Characters. I feel like there are a lot of good moments for the characters. Loki and Thor are good together. Characters that didn't get a lot of time before, now have their time to shine. I especially appreciated Heimdall's part in the movie as we never really saw much of him. Only disappointment was Lady Sif is not present, but I can live with that.3. The humor. My God did I laugh so much! Normally, a lot of the jokes just aren't that great. Spiderman Homecoming was a bit annoying and I found the humor to be tedious. Not in Thor. It really is THAT funny and I often found my stomach hurting from laughing so much. 4. Hulk and Thor TOGETHER. This was a highlight of the movie. They work so well together! 5. Lose ends tied up. This was always one for me that I had issues with. The other two Thor movies are not good. In this one too, they tie up lose ends from the other Thor movies, Age of Ultron, and Doctor Strange. I appreciated this. This movie also is a lead in into Avengers: Infinity War.All in all, this movie is great! It is easily a top 5 marvel movie. I would not be surprised if this met a billion dollars because of how good it is. Go see it!"
29 November 2018,BrainDeadDotCom,2,5,8,The best Thor so far !,"The movie has really smooth and the plot well going ! Good and powerfull villan. The acting from all the actors is awsome. It has good lines for laughing and the action scenes as awsome! I whould like little bit more hulk, but is a Thor movie right ? 😊"
21 April 2018,brian-doucette,2,4,10,Hands down the best Marvel Movie yet,"Absolutely a total enjoyment. Actors were near perfectly cast in their roles. Jeff Goldblum as GrandMaster was hilarious. He was perfect. Hope to see him again. Also this was probably the best Hulk movie even though it was a Thor movie. We get to see a lot of character development with Hulk and how he actually feels and has a sense of humor. Thor as well, he is funny as hell. Also they really played up Loki's redemption arc. It will be interesting to see the direction he takes in Infinity War. Also some of the minor characters like Korg were super cool and interesting as well as funny. The big MVP though is the actor who plays Korg as well as the director; they are one in the same. Great movie and so far the best marvel project yet. I really hope they give this Director another shot at a big one. We shall see"
23 October 2019,wildlife-ptech,0,4,6,Messy plot but full of laughs,Rating7/10This marvel movie has a messy plot and inconsistent tone. It doesn't feel connected to the other films. However it is packed with laughs and most of the cast joins in and let's their hair down. Works well as a comedy.
8 October 2018,euandaley,1,3,8,"New Thor, Better Thor",A much needed reinvigoration of a dull character that turns Thor into one of the most likeable and imentertaining heroes in Marvels seemingly never ending line up.
20 November 2017,switchboard85,2,6,8,One of the Funniest MCU Movies Yet,"I almost skipped ""Thor: Ragnarok"" entirely since this franchise has served as little more than a Thor placeholder between Avengers films in the past. Luckily, this is nowhere near the case here. Not only is this one of the better comedies of the MCU, it may be the best film they've done since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", albeit for different reasons. This strikes a perfect balance of action and comedy that this franchise was so devoid of before. The basic villain plot in this film is kind of out of left-field but its executed so well that you can ignore the finer details.Goldblum and Blanchett steal every scene they're in. Tom Hiddelston and Chris Hemsworth are able to loosen their ties a bit and look as though they're genuinely having fun this time around. The action sequences are nothing short of amazing. ""Ragnarok"" sports a color palette that takes direct inspiration from the illustrated works of Jack Kirby and it shows on every inch of the screen. The film's score is remarkably memorable and you'll never see a better use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" in any other movie. Can't wait to see this again and that's something I'd have never imagined saying about a Thor movie."
26 January 2018,mihai_alexandru_chindris,0,5,8,Monty PyThor,"I see that many make fun of it and don't like at all. Well, I'm on the other gang, and I think it has nothing wrong. Wouldn't it be boring for Marvel to feed us the same kind of movie, without ever changing just a little bit of how it works? You didn't enjoy it? Fine. Go watch a Pixar movie or whatever and come back later, when your anger is gone. And let's suppose that it indeed messed up. So what? It's probably just one or two of the many that were a big success. So stop the hate and start embracing the good sides too."
9 November 2017,hunter-friesen,0,8,7,"While not perfect, Ragnarok is the kind of fun and zany film that Thor needs.","It is an overwhelming pleasure and honor to say that Thor: Ragnarok is a good and fun superhero film, mostly because 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World are the worst films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director Taika Waititi has ditched the overly serious tone and rebranded Thor (and Chris Hemsworth) as a wisecracking and charismatic hero, and it works wonders here as the film feels like a cool summer breeze compared to the previous cold arctic blast. While not a perfect film, since it does have some problems, this film is definitely exciting and makes for a joyous experience at the cinema. In the beginning of the film, we see Thor (Chris Hemsworth) as a prisoner to Surtur, a fiery demon that wishes to bring death to all of Asgard. While he's imprisoned, Thor also learns that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has been missing from the throne and that Ragnarok, the apocalypse of Asgard, will happen soon. Thor breaks free and returns to Asgard to find that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has assumed the throne by disguising himself as Odin. Once he has been caught in the act, Loki takes Thor to Odin on Earth. Knowing these are his last days, Odin confesses to his sons that they have a half- sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who is also the goddess of death. Hela lusts for the throne and invades Asgard in order to seize it. While trying to fight her off, Thor and Loki become stranded on the world Sakaar, which is also the planet Hulk has been residing since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor needs to return to Asgard in order to save it, but he is forced to fight as a gladiator for his freedom.The film feels much faster than its official 130-minute runtime. We fly through different scenes as the story keeps building up to the climax. It almost feels like they tried to fit three hours of worth of material here and should have either added more time or cut some story elements. It's still fun and stylish but should have been given more time to breathe and play out. There is also a misallocation of screen time for the characters. Odin, Doctor Strange (very brief cameo), and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) are given much smaller roles in order to make room for new characters such as Skurge (Karl Urban) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). It's a sad thing since the new characters are disappointing in the large amount of time they are given and the much better much better ones are confined to bit parts. Thor: Ragnarok is also a film that heavily focuses on the relationships between the main characters. Throughout the film, Thor and Loki continuously rethink their past differences and remind themselves that they are still brothers. It's a fairly emotional arc that works well considering the experiences both characters have been through in the previous films. We also get a surprisingly great connection between Thor and The Hulk / Bruce Banner. Although they shared little to no moments previously, they come together and form a kind of buddy cop duo. They play really well off each other and are key to the best comedic moments in the film. Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor and really delivers on making the character funny and interesting. Previously he had been played as a stoic, but confident hero that we tolerated from time to time. In this film, he's cracking jokes and having fun on his quest, all while displaying his own brand of macho charisma. He also has a great sense of comedic timing as he often delivers one-liners at the perfect time. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and reaffirms his place as the best villain/anti-hero the MCU has to offer. Him and Hemsworth play brilliantly off each other and really feel like brothers trying to make sense of their relationship. Even though Loki has done some very evil things, like invade New York in The Avengers, we never really get the sense he is all bad. This is mostly because of Hiddleston's ability to make us feel sympathetic for Loki. Cate Blanchett does a really good job as Hela, which creates a main villain that is leagues above the previous ones we have seen in the MCU (does anybody remember Malekith or Whiplash?). Blanchett plays Hela almost like somebody would Medusa, an evil snake-like woman with the powers to kill anybody she sets her sight on. Hela cannot turn people to stone, but she can draw a sword and shoot knives out of her body at any moment. Mark Ruffalo does double duty here as both The Hulk and Bruce Banner. His motion capture work is superb and makes the character of Hulk way more complex and engaging than before. Banner has also been improved on since the last time we saw him. He's starting to lose hope in his humanity as keeps battling for control of his body with Hulk and begins to question why he keeps fighting. The minor supporting cast really stands out here, with Tessa Thompson being the most notable as Valkyrie. She's a rogue Asgardian warrior that has lost her purpose and now spends her time drinking and working for the ""Grandmaster"", played by the wonderful Jeff Goldblum. He gives the film a heavy dose of comedic weirdness and does a great job in a small, but rightly sized role. Thor: Ragnarok is fun and exciting superhero blockbuster that never takes itself too seriously. It's a huge improvement over the previous two films in the series but still suffers from the same fate as other MCU films. I'm excited about Hemsworth and co. returning again in 2018 for the highly anticipated Avengers: Infinity War."
8 November 2017,shaundowning13666,3,13,6,Half arsed,"Ragnorwhat? I expected this movie to be the keystone to phase 3 as Capt America the winter soldier was to phase 2. Unfortunately it isn't anywhere near as good.The dynamic between three main character, hulk,Thor and Loki, is excellent as always. Korg is brilliant. As to is the direction and acting.The main plot they've lifted from a few other marvel films. There is a huge glaring plot hole in the premise of the movie. Where they've changed history of Asgard. But hasn't even mentioned it, like they hoped no one would notice. I recommend going in with no preconceived ideas or it's part of a movie franchise. Go in and rate as a stand alone and it's an excellent piece of cinema with good humour. If you put it along side the rest of the franchise you'll make the mistake I made and find the franchise loosing it's footing and floundering. Ultimately running out of ideas as it continues..."

4 November 2017,achyutaghosh,0,9,10,funtastic!,"For long, comic book movies were a genre onto themselves- of caricatured characters, clichéd scripts and hackneyed plots. In the past couple of years though, comic book movies have been traversing genres. If Captain America: The Winter Soldier played out like a political thriller, Deadpool an R-rated comedy, Logan was a good old Western, Wonder Woman was mostly a war movie, The New Mutants seems to be a horror flick, and Thor: Ragnarok- despite delivering a heady mix of sci-fi and myths, is an out and out family friendly comedy! Thor: ""I know what you're thinking: how did this happen? Well, it's a long story...""For the shortest Marvel film ever, Thor: Ragnarok has a ginormous plot, and things start off at a point where Thor is hanging, literally. We last saw him in Avengers: Age of Ultron. 2 years have passed by, and Thor's search for the infinity stones leads to him being a prisoner of Surtur- the fire demon. Surtur informs that Odin has forsaken Asgard, and that Ragnarok is about to happen. Thor manages to overpower Surtur,uncovers Loki's trickery and believes the danger has past. But soon he has to confront his father's death, and as a result, the appearance of Hela, Goddess of Death who was till now restrained by the presence of Odin. The Goddess of Death proceeds to do what any Goddess of Death worth her salt would do IE. kill everyone. In the process, Mjolnir is shattered, and with it, Thor's self belief. Without Odin, the universe itself is different, Thor learns it the hard way.Fighting Hela while traveling through the Bifrost, Thor and Loki end up in Sakaar- a garbage planet connected by multiple wormholes, and ruled by The Grandmaster, who specializes in organizing gladiatorial contests. Thor is forced to participate in the contest, and it is there that he meets a friend from work. The rest of the movie is hahahaha,crash, boom, bang, and hahahaha- as Thor and his friends set to get out of Sakaar to prevent Ragnarok from happening. Thor: I had this unique hammer, made from the heart of a dying star. I would spin it, and I would fly. Korg: You rode a hammer? Thor: No, I would lie down. Korg: The hammer rode you? Thor: No, I would spin it and it would lift me off... Korg: Oh my god, the hammer threw you off? Thor: Off the ground, it threw me off the ground!Kind of strange that a movie named Ragnarok, where worlds are supposed to end, ends up becoming a non stop gag reel, and still manages to convey scale and impact. All credit though to Marvel to allow full creative freedom to director Taika Waititi, who fused two iconic story lines from the Marvel comics archives- Planet Hulk and Ragnarok, added a humorous screenplay, ensured a zingy 80s soundtrack, a million color palette, and allowed every actor (whether hero or villain) a shot at being at their funniest best for the movie. Waititi even motion captures Korg, the breakout character for me in the movie. Korg is made out of rocks, and tried to start a revolution without printing enough pamphlets, but don't let that intimidate you 😊Chris Hemsworth's comedic timing meanwhile is a revelation. Thor goes through the complete character arc in the movie- bumbling and naive to a relatively wise king of Asgard, and Hemsworth delivers with a twinkle in his eye. Tessa Thompson's Valkryie is a nice addition to the team, and do watch out for special appearances from Matt Damon, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum.W for wit, W for weird and W for Winter which is just round the corner. Embrace silliness. Go and watch Thor: Ragnarok, and do stay on for at-least the mid-credits scene for more news on the Marvel Big Bad. 10/10"
2 November 2017,cafesmitty,1,9,9,It is why you go to the movies,"This is just simply an extremely fun and entertaining movie from start to finish. And it is a family friendly movie (probably no kid under 7 or 8). This has all the humor of character and all the action of the previous superhero movies. It has great pacing and not a single solitary boring moment. DC needs to seriously think about hiring these directors. I had a bit of inside info going in. I've read Planet Hulk and World War Hulk so I know about a few incidents and it didn't disappoint. And it has some wonderful cameo appearance. And I love, love, love Cate Blanchett as the main villain. She isn't over the top and she is just simply delicious in her role. I didn't want the film to end. I'm writing this pretty generic and spoiler free. But do yourself a favor and just go see it."
26 March 2018,rutzelb,0,2,9,"Excellent, but too long","After freeing himself from a prison on the other side of the Universe, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) learns that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is not in Asgard. Thor and Loki (Tim Huddleston) go looking for Odin on Earth and are told by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) where Odin is on the condition that all Asgardians leave Earth. This is agreed to and they find Odin in Norway. Odin tells them that Ragnarok (the complete destruction of Asgard) is about to come about because his oldest child Hela (Cate Blanchett) the Goddess of Death has come back from her prison because he can no longer hold her there. This can't be good. Long story short: Thor is captured by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) on the garbage planet controlled by Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), and he finds Loki there who seems to be friends with Grandmaster. In order to escape, Thor must defeat Grandmaster's champion The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) also known to Thor as Banner. (Remember: both Thor and the Hulk are part of the team The Avengers). The Hulk doesn't recognize Thor. Oh, oh! Continuing Long Story Short: Thor, The Hulk, Loki and Valkyrie finally escape Grandmaster's planet to fight Hela on Asgard. It is here we realize the time on Grandmaster's planet was way too long. Way too long. The title of this movie is somewhat confusing. We thought Ragnarok was a evil being that needed to be defeated. Not so. It is just a term for the destruction of Asgard. This movie is a good one with spectacular CGI, but it is too long and put me into La La Land several times. Many scenes could have been cut out or shortened, but I wasn't consulted. The acting all around is spot on and the music is also heart-stomping good. Yes, we do see Stan Lee as he is in every Marvel movie in some capacity. Here he cuts Thor's hair.Notables: Karl Urban as Skurge, and he becomes Hela's Executioner; Idris Elba as Heimdall who is the Sentry of the Bifrost Bridge; Ray Stevenson as Volstagg; Sam Neill as the actor Odin seen when Thor returns to Asgard and watches the play; and Luke Hemsworth as the actor Thor in the same play.Oh, remember Jane (Natalie Portman) Thor's love interest from previous movies? She is not in this movie. Bummer. All in all a good movie, but too long (We cannot say that enough times). Believe sequels will show Asgardians on Earth where Thor will have to deal with Doctor Strange again. Will we see Jane again? Hmmm........ Stay tuned. (9/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Much.
Language: Brief short stuff."
1 December 2017,Return_of_the_Porg,1,2,7,Is it the best Thor Film Yet?,"Thor Ragnarok is an unexpectedly funny return to the Thor trilogy. By far the best of the trilogy Ragnarok stands out because of its humor and color scheme. Many fans have complained that over the years Marvel films have acquired a generic feel and tone, however, Ragnarock is all style. The movie is one of the best looking Marvel films, besides the Guardians movies. It is also very humorous but juxtaposes that humor with some very great character moments that I haven't seen in a Marvel film in a long time. It's because of this blend of action, comedy, and drama that I think this movie is worthwhile. However, the movie is a bit unmemorable. Although it will have major ramifications in the MCU, it never felt very serious. The steaks in this movie are not high enough to get one invested really deeply in the overall plot. If it weren't for the humor, visuals and key moments between the characters we love, I honestly would've rated this lower since really the steaks diminish the overall plot of the film. Having said that, the villain was passable due to some connections to the main characters. Overall I believe this film is really cool, although not groundbreaking. It's not the best film in the MCU but it sure is fun. Final score 7/10"
27 May 2019,hardymetal,3,8,10,Best Thor movie!,"Definitely the best Thor movie and one of the best MCU movies made. Don't listen to bad reviews, those people are brainless and don't understand it. Only people with no personality and are the ""fun"" ones at Parties dislike it."
30 July 2018,imadchemaly,1,3,10,Joyful and rewarding to watch,The movie surpasses the Marvel franchise in terms of subtle comic elements that makes it so fun to watch without impairing the plot. I wished it would never end. Great movie.
1 June 2018,thepriceofpayne,0,2,9,Thundah from Down Undah,"While the previous Thor films have been fair, the third film makes use of Indy director Taika Waititi's unique humor and style. Which in turn delivers a fun superhero sci-fi comedy. Hemsworth gives one of his best performances as Thor with newcomers Tessa Thompson and Cate Blanchett more than holding their own in the film. My only complaint is that while very entertaining and wonderfully made, the film does differentiate from the first two Thor films Identites and if you were a big fan you might be a little disappointed, but if you're like me you'll find joy in all of the films."

(loved the fan service scene)Some mindless humour along the way? Check.Stan Lee cameo? Check.It's a comic book, folks. A great big, dressed up, very glossy comic book — and if you get that wrong, then there's something terribly wrong with you.Now, a couple of minor cavils: the appearance of Doctor Strange at the beginning and Thor not recognizing him? Sorry, had trouble believing that — and the whole scene, while fun, seems more than a bit gratuitous. (""Hey, we can put in another Marvel character here!""). The Hulk's appearance seemed likewise contrived, with no real reason save to move the plot along a bit. Yes, he plays a big part later, but how we got him there in the first place wasn't really explained any more than ""Hulk crash here!"" Equally WTF was how a certain other Asgaardian shows up. It was like this planet was Grand Central Station for the universe.That aside, it's a fun, mindless movie with a lot of great eye candy. Cant go wrong with that."
6 November 2017,lokagariwararyan,8,18,10,Best Thor movie yet,This movie was great and everything in it was on point. The CGI was OK but not as good as DC films because their visuals are way better than marvel. The best thing about this movie is comedy and everything else is just flat and OK still i give it a 10/10. Enjoy this film in theaters.
15 June 2019,kikoydaba3,1,6,9,The best Marvel Studios has to offer,"8.5/10Thor: Ragnarok brings comedy, heart, action and a satisfying story that transforms a reluctant warrior, unsure of his role, to the rightful king of Asgard.Chris Hemswroth in the leading role shines with humor, charisma, likeability and dramatic flair that balances the goofy and emotional beats of the story. Back-upped by supporting characters with depth and are purpose-driven, Ragnarok is not merely a story of the lead character. With a fitting score and soundtrack amplifying the emotions of the characters, Taika Waititi's seamless blend of comedy and drama is rousing. Action-wise, audiences looking for fun will not be disappointed and will certainly be coming back for more. Unlike its Shakespearean predecessors, Ragnarok takes liberty from the source material but never forgets to humanizes the characters, sending them on journeys that is filled with heart."
26 April 2018,sheyda22,1,2,10,The BEST Marvel movie I´ve seen to date!,"The hommage to SEGA games gave me goosebumps throughout this amazingly beautiful movie. 
As always; Loke played by the marvelous actor, Tom Hiddleston, is the one that carries the Thor-movies. The first two movies that made me watch them ´til the end was because of Mr Hiddleston AND to not forget; the bittherHate love between two brothers; Him and Chris Hemsworth´s Thor. But this movie is simply BEAUTIFUL, and for the first time ever, I feel that I can recognize the witty humor that I always remember from the comic books (X-men/Spiderman).The guest stars appearing in this movie are like receiving Christmas gifts! What a treat! The only thing that is less perfect in this movie is the legendary big female star that don´t seem to really at home with Her part. I expected more from Her. 
But it doesn´t affect this movie´s beauty in any way.The first Marvel movie that I wanted to watch immediately after I´ve finnished seeing it. Thank you to one and all of the people contributing to make this PERFECT movie!!!"
18 June 2020,skaj-1,6,20,1,Identitiy Politics barf,"Yeah, it started a few years before, but this is where it really switched its gears up ... like the disgraceful 1-sentence Elimination of Jane Foster and the reasoning of the producers why she had to go: ""Because they needed someone ""MORE SUITED"" instead of Jane"". Yeah, how about someone who just happens to be black because we all know that Valkyrie, a nordic cultural goddess, was black, right?
And all this according to the director because he wanted to be ""more inclusive"".
What do you mean more inclusive? More inclusive by completely destroying established characters with a total disregard for a whole culture?
Pathetic.
Wanna be inclusive? How about this then: Make the next inclusive movie with Martin Luther King played by a blonde, nordic, blue eyed white dude?"
7 November 2021,knokechris,6,17,10,How can you not love this film,"The funnest movie I've been to in 20 years maybe. Immigrant song scenes were awesome.

19 August 2019,matthewjloller,1,6,8,A great comedy that sometimes under cuts its more serious moments,"The MCU's funniest offering is probably the most entertainment you can ask for in a movie. If you haven't laughed by the end of this comedy, you don't have a funny bone in your body. You will laugh your butt off as Thor travels across the universe to worlds with a great feel to them as the world-building is top notch. The jokes get a bit over played when some serious bits need more time, but a great action comedy that will thoroughly entertain with Taika Watiti's style dripping from the screen the whole way through."

Movie script is clever and even some of the jokes may sound almost too stupid the script rocks. Movie is not a narrow minded comic book filming and it wont take itself too seriously. Movie finishing is visually stunning to watch and 3D works surprising well. Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Goldblum shines at their roles. Sometimes you may think if there is already too much of comedy, but then again not. Timing is perfect and movie offers enjoyable mix of action and comedy. Like Guardians of the Galaxy movies Thor: Ragnarok is well made scifi action comedy. Very enjoyable movie with great acting and one juicy cameo."

27 January 2018,Wililjam,0,6,9,"Fantastic, hilarious and a bit out of character...","'Thor: Ragnarok' is by far one of my favorite films in the MCU. It is funny, it has stunning visuals, great chemistry between ALL the characters, but at times it felt a bit out of character.The 'Thor' movie series started off pretty decent, the sequel was a tad worse than the first, so I was afraid that the third installment would suffer the same fate. I was wrong. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best in the 'Thor' movie series. I'm not going to spoil anything about the plot, because I went in blind as I think you should do too. What I will say is that this movie offers beginnings for some characters and closure for others. It does so in a fantastic way.A bad thing about this movie, though, is the fact that some characters might feel, out of character. Thor, for example, is a little less serious than he has been in the previous movies he has starred in. That is probably the only bad thing about this movie. I will close this review by saying that Cate Blanchette was amazing in this movie. I didn't see Cate Blanchette though, I saw Hela, Goddess of Death. She WAS the character, she didn't play the character. With that said, I rate this 8.5/10, due to the out of character parts of the movie. If you have seen the other 'Thor' movies then I encourage you to watch this one, it will make up for everything you've gone through."
6 May 2020,vmknjsae,4,10,2,This Film's Writer And Director Need To Go Pound Sand,"It really sucks, is really bad, and I was a real fan of Thor, but this one was like a bad dream, I paid $10 for the DVD and at the minute 35 I wanted to chuck it, this movie is really bad."

15 July 2018,domtaylor,0,1,6,"It's the best 'Thor' movie, but that's not saying much.","The change in direction for the 'Thor' franchise is a welcome one that elevates 'Thor: Ragnarok' above its two predecessors. Unfortunately though, only just. The film is a straight-up comedy at the expense of an investing story, real character development and emotional investment, which would be fine if any of the comedy was actually funny. The majority of entertainment value would come from the film's comedic moments, and since they are actually rather annoying, there isn't much to enjoy here. It's a shame, too, since director Taika Waititi has proven time and time again that he's capable of creating genuinely funny comedy. It's not all bad though; the movie is colourful enough, has some entertaining action and I can't say that I was ever bored. The 'comedy' just really drags it down. It's bizarre, as well, that out of all the 'Thor' stories they could have attempted the full comedy route with, they decided to try it out with 'Ragnarok', one of the hero's darkest. 6/10"
18 January 2019,rryweck,3,5,9,Thor: Ragnarok Hammers Out A Hit,"Despite how poorly directed and filmed the movies Thor and Thor: The Dark World were, the third movie in the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok, brings comedy, action, and new characters to the table. Thor: Ragnarok is beautifully filmed and directed by Taika Waititi, who had previously acted in the unfortunate movie The Green Lantern. Not only did Waititi direct and produce the film, but he also starred in it as a side character, Korg. I find this movie fascinating due to its marvelous acting, comical script, and astonishing photography.
This movie is about Thor's struggle to defeat his older sister, Hela, the Goddess of Death. This journey takes him to multiple planets where he meets new and old characters. Thor starts out in the Underworld where he fights a demon named Surtur who was prophesied to destroy his home. Later on in Sakaar, Thor gets reunited with the Hulk and meets new heroes such as Valkyrie and Korg. While Thor was stuck on another planet, Hela was planning on taking over all realms in the universe. She raised her army of dead soldiers and her giant wolf Fenris. With the help of his friends, Thor escapes Sakaar and flies back to Asgard. Thor and his friends take on Hela and her army. As they struggle to fight them, Loki, his brother, shows up with an army of prisoners from Sakaar. Thor then fights Hela, and while he does so, he uses his true powers to help fight her. He strikes her with a lightning bolt. Unable to defeat his sister, Thor had nothing else to turn to, but I will not spoil the ending for you.
One thing I enjoyed about this film was the incredible acting. Chris Hemsworth, who had taken on the role of Thor four times before (Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), used his superhero experience to create an amazing, lively, hilarious character in the latest Thor movie. Not only did Hemsworth portray a perfect Thor character, but he even improved from the previous movies from the franchise. Hemsworth wasn't the only talented actor that was thrown into the mix. Actors such as Tom Hiddleston (Thor, Thor: The Dark World), Cate Blanchett (Carol, The Gift), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk, The Avengers), and Tessa Thompson (Creed) also starred in the film. Although Mark Ruffalo is an extremely accomplished actor, his role in this movie lacked some personality. I personally believe that he could have put a little more effort into his performance. On the other hand as a newer actress in Hollywood, Tessa Thompson had a giant role to fill. Although her experience is limited, Thompson was not a let down. She couldn't have been a better fit for the part. From her snarky looks to her skillful fighting, Thompson was the best Valkyrie possible.
Another great thing that was added to the movie were the classic Marvel cameos. Of course, none other than Stan Lee himself was the one who gave Thor a haircut. Dr. Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange, The Imitation Game) had also appeared in the beginning of the film. Once in Asgard, Thor witnessed a play that was being put on about Loki's tragic death. The actor who played Loki was actually Matt Damon (Jason Bourne, The Martian) and Thor was actually played by Hemsworth's least known brother, Luke Hemsworth (Hickok, The Anomaly).
Lastly I loved the way they filmed the movie, the effects and photography were absolutely superb. Waititi, the director, used brilliant colors and astounding special effects to draw in the viewer. All the effects blended in seamlessly, all scenes connected perfectly together. Not only were the effects great, but Waititi showed both sides to the confrontation. At some points, the movie would only focus on what Thor and his allies were doing, and then on the other side, viewers would get to see the devious plans Hela had for the Universe. Waititi used his special effects to also create some of the most iconic entrance scenes in Marvel history. When entering the fight with Hela, Thor dropped down from the sky in slow motion, lightning bolts crackling and exploding from his skin. Valkyrie entered by walking, also in slow motion, along the beautiful rainbow bridge, dressed in her iconic warrior uniform, with gigantic fireworks exploding in the background. Although some of the entrances were serious yet prodigious, Waititi decided to put some comedy back into the way he filmed this movie. The Hulk's entrance was my favorite one of all. He started off as Bruce Banner, observing Fenris from a spaceship. Banner decided to aid in the fight by taking on Fenris and releasing the Hulk. So he jumped out of the plane, and without turning into the Hulk, Banner crashed onto the bridge and laid there until he was able to turn.
One of the key themes to this movie is peace. In every Marvel movie, the goal of the hero is to create peace within the world. Each hero has to defeat a villain that comes their way in order to keep harmony in the universe. Another major theme within this movie is power. Throughout the movies Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok, Loki and Thor had power disputes. Loki wanted to take control over the throne, he even pretended to be King Odin. However, in this film it is Hela who truly wants to seize power of the throne. Although Loki, Hela, and Thor all fight about power, Thor doesn't really care about being king. He just wants the best for his people. In the end, Thor ends up as the newest King of Asgard.
In conclusion I find this movie to be one of the best movies in the Marvel movie series. I enjoy watching this movie because not only does it tell the story of a hero, but it takes the viewer on an extremely fun and adventurous journey through different realms. This film was also enjoyable because of the way the director wrote the script and executed the movie."
18 August 2018,pnkstr,1,5,8,Different,"Finally got around to watching this. Thought is was going to be just another story in the endless marvel series. However I was actually pleasantly surprised by this movie. Its a more light-heated movie than the rest. The characters seem more down to earth in this movie and don't take themselves to seriously. Yes its another movie that follows the same old formula, baddie wants to rule the universe, goodies have to stop them but its a lot more fun than the rest and a refreshing change."
5 July 2018,ricardomartins_thesecond,1,3,9,Quirkier action/comedy and it's OK!,"Thor: Ragnarok is a quirkier action/comedy movie. And it is OK!It's what we've seen from the comedy-injected Marvel movies. Thor:Ragnarok goes a little bit further though, and take itself a bit less serious. And it's OK!There's action, story, comedy. The whole shebang!What this movie did is not make you bored, ever. And it is OK!That said, I'm not a comic book connoisseur. Just come to better know the Marvel universe from the movies.Been reading negative reviews about character, seriousness of the movie, and it seems to me that these reviewers (who give 1/10) are people who have serious expectations for a movie. In no way does this movie deserve a 1/10. There's so much in it to NOT deserve this rating. Movies CAN be easy to watch and provide entertainment."
5 November 2017,raja-mishra7,1,10,10,THOR- RAGNAROK: Supremely entertaining,"This is one of those movies that everything placed exactly as it should, in the department of screen play; the rest falls in place with the uber-talented crew.Taika Waititi, Eric Pearson and team have done a wonderful job in the back-end which is complemented pretty convincingly by Hemsworth, Ruffalo and team on screen.Everything from fight sequences, to comic timing, to conflicts building up to the climax, which could have been a bit better, are contributing to the entertainment quotient.It is a must watch and bit of a far cry from the regular Marvel potboilers. But if you are a DC fan and you think of this as a serious superhero movies, this is not the one for you, Marvel is closing in on that goal, while DC is on reverse gear, trying to walk away from the serious stuff. Thor Ragnarok is the perfect mid-way. Perhaps, one of the best Marvel movies ever."
7 December 2017,jljacobi,0,2,7,Very good but walks a fine comedic line,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. Just about all the acting is top notch and it's, well fun. But there is an aspect that you see sometimes in Hollywood, generally when actors get too much input, of ""top this"" or ""I want a funny line too!"". In short, it borders on being to comedic for its own good.But only borders. Overall, the movie manages to walk the line pretty well. Every once in a while I thought I was watching the actor and not the character. But only rarely. I especially enjoyed Jeff Goldblum who was actually pleasantly understated when he had a chance to go way over the top (in a bad way) Regardless, and in spite of Marvel's shameless mangling of Norse mythology, it's good time."
3 November 2017,josephschaller-53021,5,10,6,Overall Just Okay,"The overall movie was okay. The action scenes were good. The in between scenes were a bit too ""campy"" for my taste. The writers tried too hard to inject humor in too many places. Thor was a bit disappointing in a few scenes where I felt he was less than ""god-like"". Is it worth going to see? Maybe. I would definitely not pay to see it a second time. Both my wife and I walked away with the feeling of disappointment. We expected more."
9 December 2019,jeffreyyoung12,2,6,7,Just plain bad,This does it for me. I expected more from Thor as he is the God of Thunder and you could do so much with him but they weren't able to do that in this film.

5 November 2017,shweta-51657,0,3,8,"Fun, entertaining shallow Marvel movie","Don't get me wrong, it's far better than Suicide Squad, (oh sweet Lord, nearly any popcorn film these days is). Its very entertaining. But it's a fluff popcorn film. Honestly, good for a one time watch but you won't regret paying for the popcorn. Hence the 8 on 10. Some scenes could have been done with a touch of class. Some scenes were executed beautifully and I couldn't ask for more.The comedy in the movie wasn't overkill, rather it was very tastefully done. But overall, an entirely shallow movie and it didn't have to be, it had immense potential to milk tears, ( the producers decided otherwise I suppose).Huge potential to be deep and dark and overly frightening. I'm not complaining. How can I? They used Led Zeppelin in the soundtrack. I just wish it wasn't treated as popcorn flick which it sadly is. Hemsworth on the other hand. Who knew he could do comedy? Apparently, Director Taika Waititi did! Hela was a nice surprise too. Oh. And Mark Ruffalo was on screen having loads of fun. Do watch. No regrets here"
13 September 2019,toshnick,2,8,10,So good,Such a awesome film specially as Thor is my favourite marvel superhero
19 May 2021,cynohith,6,14,3,Subpar movie,"I laughed a few times, the humor made up for what would've been a boring movie. The CGI and action makes the movies more fun. There's not much thought that has to be put in to watching these movies, which is maybe insulting if that's what Hollywood thinks their movie-goers; Even if the movies are marketed to a younger audience, they can handle something with more substance, it's just fast-food for the mind. The experience could've been different in theaters however for some people."
5 November 2017,Brevin_Campbell,0,7,8,Exactly what Thor needed,"So traditionally the Thor movies have typically been the weakest in the MCU, but when I saw the trailers for this film I knew that there is 90% chance this film would change Thor for the better. On top of that the director brought up how he never watched the previous Thor films and how this would reboot Thor for the better and it did.Thor Ragnarok is a full on, no hold bars cosmic superhero story in space with some great action sequences and some beautiful and gorgeous visual effects. It takes my favorite parts of the Thor mythos and amps them all up by 500x making for a more fun and more entertaining movie overall and I loved it for that. I love the fact that Thor isn't super stiff in this movie too. He is actually adding a lot to the comedy for the movie and making a lot more entertaining as well.The acting in this movie is also quite good too. A lot of the actors really do merge well into there roles and it is quite amazing and I like it a lot. Hela is such a great and evil villain too and her reasoning is really interesting as well. So is Valkerie in the film. She is also a great add on to the movie. Overall I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it."

17 November 2017,Parks,1,9,9,Taika Waititi Does It Again,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is be the best time I've had at the cinema in a long time. And the most enjoyable superhero film I've yet seen.Possibly what makes this even more delightful is how unexpected it is. Cards on the table. Prior to this film, Thor was boring. I have seen ""Thor: The Dark World"" twice. I still can't really remember what it was about.And here's where Taika Waititi's talent shines through. We hear a lot about those directors who make ""beautiful"" films. And here I'm mainly thinking of Ridley Scott and Zack Snyder who make great-looking films, but seem to feel that characterisation and motivation just aren't important.But Taika Waititi appears to be a director who understands that it's characters who drive a great story. Here, he allows the actors room to find their characters through improvisation. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" finally allowed Chris Hemsworth to show us that Thor is more than a god-like superhero with a firm jaw, and it pays off in spades.But it's not just Hemsworth who benefits from Waititi's direction. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is so stuffed full of great performances you'll walk out of the cinema arguing over who was your favourite character. The ""new & improved"" Hulk? Cate Blanchett clearly having great fun at the Goddess of Death? The dazed & confused Bruce Banner? Amazingly enough, that's just the start of it. Often the stars of the film are the new side-characters. Valkyrie is absolutely terrific, Scourge has a believable journey; Korg is a hoot and the banter between Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and the wonderful Rachel House as his guard is a joy.But focusing on Waititi's directorial strength as an actor's director isn't to diminish the visual style of the film either. Some of the scenes - most notably the Valkyrie attack on Hela are stunning. And the scenes on Siccar take the retro-cool 1970's aesthetic of James Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and runs even further with it.Finally, the story is genuinely satisfying with an ending that doesn't rely on constant bashing and brute force winning the day. There's actually a pretty smart resolution at work here, involving a major sacrifice.""Thor 3"" flies in the face of those who predict the bursting of the superhero bubble. This film opens so many doors I can't wait for Marvel and DC to keep on exploring new ways to tell these stories."
9 July 2018,3_the_monkey,1,6,10,I can't fault this,"If I am Honest I don't think this is the best Marvel film, I prefer other Marvel films (which I rated lower) but ranking this film on its own merits I really don't see how they could have made Ragnarok any better and isn't that what a 10star should be?"
8 November 2019,JessieCollins1,1,2,8,Too bad Marvel,Story could've been great but it seemed to me that the writers got lazy with the script and just opted to feed Thor some cheesy humor that made him seem like this kid who was trying too hard to be funny instead of the GOD of Thunder the first two films built him up to be.
10 January 2022,LiiaPantz,1,4,10,It's Hilarious,"In my opinion, it's the funniest Marvel movie. I was cry-laughing the entire time. I also the whole aesthetic of the film overall. It's one of the silliest of the Marvel movies as well, so if you like them to be more serious then this won't be your favorite."
5 November 2017,capaldimark,2,7,9,A blast from start to finish,"Fun! That is one of the many ways to describe Thor: Ragnarok, the third installment of the Thor series and the first one directed by Taika Waititi. Coincidentally, it just so happens to be not only the funniest, but one of the very best Marvel movies to date.Ragnarok is a simple, yet interesting story. It begins with Thor imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur. Surtur informs Thor that his father, Odin, is no longer on Asgard and that Asgard will soon be destroyed by the Ragnarok catastrophe. Thor quickly escapes and defeats Surtur, believing that he has stopped Ragnarok. However, this is not the case, as the Goddess of Death, Hela, arrives on Asgard to fulfill the Ragnarok prophecy. Outmatched, Thor must now create a team to stop Hela from destroying his beloved homeland. It's a pretty straightforward plot, and even though it doesn't take itself too seriously, there's just the right amount of darkness to make it believable.What makes Ragnarok work so well as a movie is its vision and approach. It knows what it is and what it wants to do. It's essentially a comedy and an action movie, and as both, it succeeds. The jokes are funny, clever, and never forced, unlike Marvel's ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"", which I felt had too many forced jokes that a lot of the times were not very funny and didn't fit. While ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" seemed unsure of itself and what it wanted to be, Ragnarok knows exactly what it wants to be, a comedy with some great action, and it succeeds as just that. The movie never bores you. When there's no comedy, there's action and when there's no action, there's comedy. As a result, I found myself consistently entertained throughout the whole movie.As for the cast, everyone is solid, and, seemingly much more relaxed in their roles. Hemsworth in particular seems much more relaxed and comfortable playing the God of Thunder. Hiddleston and Ruffalo as Loki and Hulk/Bruce Banner, respectively, are solid yet again in their roles. Newcomer Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie adds a nice spark to the group. But perhaps the most interesting performance in the film is Cate Blanchett as the villain Hela. It's not often we see female villains in comic-book movies and Blanchett has just the right amount of feistiness to make Hela an intimidating villain.All in all, ""Thor: Ragnarok"", is an entertaining thrill ride of a movie. It combines action and comedy to create a movie that is not only consistently entertaining, but that's also a breath of fresh air for a Thor series that desperately needed it. A lot of credit for that can go to director Taika Waititi's clear-cut vision for the film. Sure, the movie may be a bit too long and as a whole its very formulaic, but those are relatively minor complaints. No matter how you slice it, Thor: Ragnarok is simply a blast."
5 November 2017,CobertNeede,1,11,8,Marvel's Finest Yet !!,"I am , personally a huge DC fan but even for the haters, this is wild fun !Thor - Ragnarok has put a very solid and firm theme early from the beginning of the film - Insane action ! Apart from the earlier two movies, the third installment has a fresh tone in about everything. The action, the humor, the atmosphere and about everything and everyone in Ragnarok was incredible. All the lead actors provided top-notch performances while Tom Hiddleston yet again being the fan favorite. The color grading and editing has improved a lot from the previous installments and Marvel seems to be learning from their mistakes ( Civil War ;). Ragnarok is kind of a redemption for the Thor Franchise ; weak first two films , a magnificent third one. Talking about Ragnarok, the story and the character arcs were marvelous. Cate Blanchett rocked as Hela, providing us with yet another fine villain character. Ragnorak has also fixed many of their story development problems. The previous films had us scraping here and there to make sense of the story, but Taika Waititi has done a marvelous job in keeping the story simple and plain. A great amount of effort has also gone out in the editing area, a perfect blend of 80's effects and transitions had made this a fun watch. The immigrant from led zeppelin was perfect for the action sequences ( EVEN MORE FUN !! ) and not forgetting the thunderous and savage Hulk's presence in the film. Kids will love it, adults will love it ; heck anyone with a sense of humor will love it !! Astounding visuals and even better soundtrack makes Ragnarok a must watch for any movie lovers !"
4 November 2017,sujanfaster,0,9,9,Thor time's a charm,"The MARVEL bandwagon successfully rolls on with the newly released Thor Ragnarok. It goes without saying that there is no shortage of entertainment and some exceptional visuals in this film. This film is the pinnacle of the MARVEL movie (r)evolution. This is a clear representation of what works in the Superhero movies these days. Thor: Ragnarok answers questions that were left unanswered after the previous movie Thor: The Dark World. Thor and Loki still having trust issues have to face their sister Hela, the first born to prevent 'Ragnarok' which is the destruction of Asgard. Hela claims her right to the throne as firstborn and seeks revenge against her father Odin by taking over Asgard and destroying Thor's hammer. Thor and Loki get stranded on the planet Sakaar in the process. After which the movie is about how Thor makes some old and new friends to fight and protect the people of his homeland. A very little of Earth is involved this time around. Most parts of the movie happens in Asgard and Sakaar. It is arguably the most funniest MARVEL movie till date. Although there is not much wit and sarcasm like the previous MARVEL movies, the comic timing in the movie is just about perfect. Beautiful, is the word that I would like to use to describe the action sequences as they seem like a work of art. Special mention to the costume design, hair and makeup department in the movie as they have come with some very innovative styles.This movie has an elaborate cast and the best part is that it makes sure it uses all of them to their potential. Chris Hemsworth has massively improved as an actor and I think the evolution of the Thor character from a straight faced god to a mischievous one has a lot to do with it. Cate Blanchett looks menacing as Hela and she does very well in this not so subtle negative role (which she is generally not used to). Mark Ruffalo is funny as both The Hulk and Dr Bruce Banner. The role of Valkyrie is surely going to give Tessa Thompson a good career boost. Karl Urban and Idris Elba justify their supporting roles. Oh and he director Taika Watiti's role as Korg is really worth a mention. Also, watch out for a special cameo by a top actor whose name I am not going to reveal ;-)Thor Ragnarok may not be MARVEL's best movie till date, but it surely is a very fun ride."

18 November 2017,horizonbts-206-628336,1,8,9,Enjoyable ride-Start to Finish!!,"If you loved either of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, then you will love this Thor: Rannarok movie. The humor and one liners are quick and light hearted and come at a fast pace as the action flows. I found myself laughing at many different times throughout the movie. The special effects, story line, and overall scope is over the top. I think even the actors and actresses involved enjoyed themselves in this Marvel edition, as you could feel it project out to us the viewers. This is one of the most enjoyable rides of the summer. Now I can't wait for the next edition of Thor to hit the big screen. Actually I found DC's Wonder Woman and Marvel's Spiderman homecoming equally enjoyable earlier this summer, and was planning on seeing Thor: Ragnarok, but honestly not as pumped about the opening. That being said I think I would reverse my order of which I liked best of the superhero releases this summer and put Thor at the top, with DC's Wonder Woman coming in second, and lastly Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland. Can't wait to see ""The Justice League"" and can only hope I am not disappointed as it has quite a bit to live up to, and all of the above mentioned flicks are hard acts to follow!!"

But this movie is a near perfect mix of superheroes, action and comedy. . Ranks up there with Avengers Ultron, Infinity War, Spider-man Homecoming and Captain America, Civil War. Not too many tie ins to the Infinity story line, so can be enjoyed as a stand alone movie, and enough to entertain everyone."
17 March 2018,SkyPowers,1,4,9,A Satirical Mythic Epic That Hits All the Right Notes,"Ratings and reviews are subjective. Some prefer their coffee black. Others with cream and sugar. This adventure resonated with me on the never-a-dull-moment scale of entertainment. I have a female roommate who said it wasn't her cup of tea (to mix metaphors). For your average male, the muscular, masculine, handsome and charismatic Thor tickles our primal caveman id. For sure, he brings out the kid in us who always fantasizes about being Superman (to mix franchises). And for women ... do I really need to explain the appeal? But this is a love story between two brothers. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki is simply mesmerizing. Most comic book characters tend to be, well, cartoony simplistic. Not here. Quite the opposite as we watch the myriad machinations of his internal struggle between good and evil. And Hemsworth's comedic turn here shows his growth as an actor, the dueling banter between Thor and Loki the magical thread that holds it all together. It is so easy to misstep the delicate balance between humor, farce and Marvel-esque SFX action plot -- here where two beguiling villains, evil sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) and the acerbic sadist Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) vie for control of the universe. Blanchett hugs her narcissist role with obvious delight, getting the chance to play the villain of a lifetime as a black-haired amazon in skin tight spandex and a headdress that puts Maleficent to shame. ""Bow to your queen!"" She is the empowered female counterpart to Thor for the Me generation. Please note that was meant tongue-in-cheek. I seldom if ever give 9 stars. But the test for me is I watched it the 2nd time one day after and found it equally entertaining, that time analyzing why the film holds your attention nonstop, scene to scene from start to finish."
5 November 2017,sanjidparvez,0,5,9,A total entertainer!,"It was delightfully funny indeed but didn't find over the top kind of funny at all, especially after reading such comments or reviews like total comedic trash etc. Even GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY vol. 1 & 2 were way more comedic than this one. Though bit under used but Blanchett still shines as a badass, sexy Marvel villain. Glad to see Loki & Hulk got a good deal of screen time than I anticipated. Overall, a total entertainer and found this even better than Spider-man: Homecoming (2017) and the 3rd best superhero film of the year after LOGAN & WONDER WOMAN so far."
10 September 2019,ssnake_z,1,4,7,There was a Ragnarok?,"THOR: RAGNAROK
RATING: 3.7/5The first action scene, is something I'd been waiting to see for years now, Thor literally swinging his hammer around like a badass in fights. It was perfect, and felt right out of the comics. Loki is as Loki does, so not much to say there. Jeff Goldblum was Jeff Goldblum as the Grand Master, so take it or leave it. Valkyrie was good but she left something to be desired IMO. With the backstory they gave her, and how it tied into the overall story, it felt like a missed opportunity for that character.Seeing Doctor Strange's cameo was fantastic, i loved everything about it because you could see that he had gotten a lot better at using magic, compared to his own movie where he was struggling. Hulk was good and I wish we had gotten more information about him and how he's been, but alas it's not his movie. Visually the movie is fantastic, it's a Marvel Studios movie, so you know the production value is gonna be there. The score is pretty forgettable, as usual, but the trade off is that they use Led Zepplin's ""Immigrant song"" from the trailers.I guess my main gripe would be that the movie has the word RAGNAROK, in the title, but it never feels like it. Everything is so lighthearted and jovial, that even when serious scenes happen, they don't resonate long, if at all. The film moves so fast, that it ends up becoming emotionally unbalanced. Any time the movie tries to be emotional, the scenes either fall flat or are undercut by a joke. Almost every time Anthony Hopkins was on screen, it got on my nerves because he felt so out of place visually with the rest of the movie, if he didn't wanna dress up, he shoulda just stayed home. If he wasn't so important to the story, I'd say the movie would have been better off without him. Cate Blanchet looks incredible as Hela, and she's a villain you really want to like, with kind of a tragic backstory, but she's almost completely wasted as a villain here. The revelations about her origins and the significance they hold for all of Asgard, are practically buried under a mountain of jokes and pretty visuals. It was a little frustrating to see so many great story pieces on the board, and then slowly realize that they were going to waste every single one of those opportunities.Ultimately, this movie had a lot of good to great ideas going on, that it chose not to use to their full potential. That being said, Thor honestly feels reinvigorated as a character here, and the movie feels like the start of a new beginning for the franchise. If any Marvel character deserves a 4th movie, I'd have to say, it probably should be Thor. In the end, THOR RAGNAROK is a fun and colorful, but pretty flawed, popcorn movie, that chose to be funny, instead of epic... still, i am definitely interested to see what the future holds for Thor. :D"
2 May 2019,Wraithe,3,8,9,Simply a blast,"Simply a blast - some great scenes (Thor's opening fight is simply enjoyable), good comedy, good action. If anything was lacking, it was not enough Hela, could easily have expanded the movies runtime some for her. One of the best Marvel Superhero movies out there."
9 November 2017,ultimateparadox,3,5,4,"It was okay/good, not great","Thor:Ragnarok seemed, during many moments in the movie, to be a parody, especially with the cheesy jokes, and the 'punched up' humor (truly unnecessary). I thought Blanchett was EXCELLENT as Hela, though, and I liked Tessa the Valkyrie. My main problem was Thor's corniness ('please don't cut my hair!', etc), but I did very much enjoy the Thor vs Hulk fight scene, of course. Although I gave 4 out of 10, don't think I'll watch it again even when it comes on cable, unless someone else is paying for it. Needed to be more serious."
24 April 2022,christinev-03388,2,3,8,Big improvement,"Spectacular visuals, lots of action, full of entertainment and full of laughs. This doesn't take itself too seriously which is a big (but welcome) contrast to the first 2 films overly serious tone."
9 June 2022,yoshbuck,0,0,9,9/10,"Taika Waititi brings a more entertaining approach to the MCU while maintaining crucial plot elements and character build-up. Managing to have real emotional moments at a time, but mostly this movie is funny. However, Thor may have an inconsistent character phase through phase 3. From nobleman to a bit of a goofball, it alternates between Infinity War and Endgame films. But this movie is a good time, where everyone is entertaining to watch, and there is never a dull moment. Many characters have rich chemistry, especially Thor, Hulk, and Loki. Thor Ragnarok completely rocks."
2 November 2017,dschlatter,0,9,9,Didn't like it? Should have watched the trailer!,"The only reason why the movie doesn't deserve 10 stars is that the villain is not great. Just OK. Everything else was the Marvel Universe at its best. The actors were having a blast making this movie and it shows. Thay gave their best. Seriously, how often in a franchise is number three the most entertaining movie? And yes, if you're looking for story, emotion and serious storytelling, then stick to Thor 1. Ragnarök is completely different. Loved it. Only Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool can match the humor.I feel sorry for Justice League already. Because, let's be honest, what was the last DC movie that was actually very good? Dark Night? Constantine? There you go..."
16 July 2018,johnfrankenstein,4,8,5,They changed the Norse mythology,"According to Norse mythology, Hela was niece of Thor not his sister and Jörmungandr (The World Serpent) was supposed to join his sibling Fenrir (The Wolf) during Ragnarok. They all were Loki's children. And what was Hulk and Dr. Strange doing in Norse Mythology ??You can't just add anything or edit any mythology. Thor was always a dull series but now it's turning into something even worse. Since when did Hulk started playing with soft toys ? Are you kidding me ? What was he doing there in first place ? First half of the movie is really slow and boring. It's one time watch only type of movie. Hoping for a better version of Thor in next instalment."
12 November 2017,sfinancing,0,6,8,"A fun, thrill ride...","...but just a bit lacking.Let me start out by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There were numerous funny moments, some of which pushed toward hilarious. The story was decent and ultimately this was a much better movie than the previous adventures starring the Asgardian.The good first:As stated previously(by me and every other commenter) this movie takes a rather light hearted and fun poke at the franchise. In terms of story it is solid and relatively consistent.The acting, top to bottom, is first rate. Would have liked to have seen more character interaction.In general the comedy is well placed.Directing is spot on, fast paced start to finish.CGI of a summer blockbuster. A well done summer blockbuster, so the CGI didn't take over in my opinion.The not so good(but still not bad):Would have liked to have seen more of Hopkins and especially(though it would have been a break from the story as told) some interaction between Blanchet and he would have been awesome.Humor seemed a bit forced in spots.Overall:Well worth the price of admission and definitely one to rewatch down the road."
15 May 2020,orbjrofi,3,8,2,Yikes,"Stand up comic. He defeats himself and all adversaries even though he lost his hammer, doesn't know his own powers and is yelling jokes and one liners.In short: not Thor"
25 August 2018,poseye,2,7,9,Underrated,"One of my favorites, for all ages. This film really expands Thor. The character development is great, making him more relatable due to time on Earth. The lightheartedness of the movie and the film overall was a bold and unique move. Taika Waititi really brought this movie together and redeemed Thor. Ragnorak was vital for Thor's unleashing of his full potential. Allowing the actors to improvise and bring out themselves through the characters made all the difference as well.
The storyline blends in nicely and it explains so much, and catches everyone up. It doesn't feel like an unnecessary add on. We had Loki on the Throne from The Dark World, which was a problem that needed to be addressed. We have a missing Thor and Hulk in Civil War, which needed to be explained, and of course Thanos had to start somewhere. The whole movie fits in so nicely to the MCU
Another thing I just have to point out is the CGI and visuals of this movie are spot on, down to the smallest detail. Even Hulk looked so much like Mark Ruffalo.
The only complaint I have is that sometimes the humor was a little to much at parts. We didn't really need to see Thor scream like a little girl. Yet all the laughs kept me going through Infinity War, as if Marvel knew we needed something to cheer us up before the next Avengers. Team Thor!"
2 January 2018,slicedbread117,0,4,10,An Abundance of Entertainment: Thor Has Never Been Better,"Most fans would agree that Thor, thus far, endured the weakest slate of individual films in the MCU, and it's hard to argue that. The original Thor was truly a great origin story for the character, and even though it's sequel, The Dark World, was a decent second act, it certainly lacked that certain pizzazz that makes MCU films so engaging. Welcome to Thor: Ragnarok, a film that completely re-invents the character and the Thor franchise as a whole, creating one of Marvel's best movies to date.So what makes Ragnarok so different, and in turn, so great? The big change is the complete 360 turn in tone and atmosphere that the first two Thor films set; moving away from Earth, ditching the love interest sub plot, and taking itself way less seriously all open up the creative juices, crafting a colorful, explosive, wildly humorous buddy-cop-style romp in space, changes that evolve Thor into a much more interesting character and create a more entertaining film all around. Some will look at Guardians of the Galaxy as a major influence to Ragnarok's style, and this may be partially true. But director Taikai Waitia was given creative freedom to craft Ragnarok mostly in his vision, and this was the change Thor needed, regardless of the similarities to GotG, which, after all, was a tremendously entertaining flick and one of Marvel's best, and now, Ragnarok is no different.Ragnarok's main story focuses on Asgard's end of days, the arrival of the villainous Hela, and Thor his MCU-staple brother Loki fighting to stop all the aforementioned. The plot seems like it will stay the course of your traditional Marvel film, but takes a terrific turn by sending Thor and Loki to the planet Sakarr, while Hela is left to impose her will on Asgard. Bringing the Asgardian brothers to Sakarr opens a pathway to wonderful storytelling, including everyone's favorite Incredible Hulk into the mix as a main character and sprinkling elements of the acclaimed 'Planet Hulk' story line that fans have been clamoring to see on screen. The narrative bounces between Thor, Loki and Hulk on Sakarr and Hela on Asgard, all which is balanced and paced very well, a trend continued through most Marvel films. Ragnarok's story never once felt dull, it kept me intrigued and excited to see the plot progression, a story that doesn't slow down for a bit.The bountiful cast of characters is no doubt another pillar of what makes Ragnarok so enjoyable, and the cast themselves were all outstanding. The stars of the show (Thor, Loki and Hulk) are all massively enjoyable; there's dazzling action, strong chemistry, deep character development and plenty of brilliantly hilarious dialogue between the three to run the show for the entire film. Chris Hemsworth was given plenty of room to exercise his comedic chops for this one, giving a newer but still awesome take on the God of Thunder, while Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is better than ever in Ragnarok, getting a huge character upgrade, making Hulk more exciting and layered. Along the stars are delightful new characters to welcome into the vast MCU. The likes of Valkyrie, Grandmaster, Korg and last but not least, Hela, all reset the previous mold fitted to the Thor franchise, injecting more life and energy into what was a formerly rather dull cast, and of course, add even more heavy star power to Marvel. Hela is the latest Marvel baddie to be judged on the MCU's ""villain problem"" a problem I don't see at all here. Hela is an intimidating and fierce villain, cunning and strong, and the amazing acting prowess of Cate Blanchett leads the way to having a legitimate female villain, a win for fans and the film industry. Some more dedicated screen time would have benefited Hela for sure, as well as more time for the likes of Heimdall and Skurge, but overall Hela, in my eyes, continues the trend of increasingly well-produced MCU villains. The action is classic Marvel. Colorful, bombastic action sequences are everywhere, highlighted by state-of-the-art CGI, beautiful atmospheric tones and a fun soundtrack lead by one of the greatest rock songs of all-time, Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"", which just makes the action scenes it's in so much more fun. If you're looking for high-octane action, Ragnarok has got you covered ten times over.The only dislike that sticks out to me is the sometimes miss-timed and overused comedy. Ragnarok undoubtedly thrives with its change of tone to include more humor and wackiness, but there's no question that there are a few noticeable points where the humor was taken too far, or completely misfired. This flaw causes hiccups in scenes that probably shouldn't have been taken lightly, a flaw that kept me from always taking the film seriously, something I wanted a little more of.Some will complain that Ragnarok was too crazy or not gritty enough, but it was clear that this franchise was desperate for a shift in tone and Taikai Waitia delivered. Ragnarok not only completely changes the name of the game of what to expect from a Thor film, it does it with a bang. The set of characters and their actors were fantastic, the story was engaging and well paced, the action and humor were a total blast, etc, etc, etc. Thor: Ragnarok is simply down right fun to watch, and I couldn't ask for anything better than that.9.5/10"
29 June 2019,jimbowclock,1,7,8,Retro Thor,"Ragnorok is silly. I guess the only way to keep thor going. Doctor strange's serious tone is almost all out the window now. An extreme self awareness of these characters. People are just straight getting murdered in this movie with no consequences which is weird after civil war. To go from civil war to this to infinity war is hard to deal with. It has great visuals and cool confident shots. This is just as wacky as the dark world but at least the wackiness is fun here. This movie doesn't really work for me as a marvel cinematic universe chapter, but as an individual thor movie it's crazy and amazing. It's just so damn silly and insane. Retro madness. It's like a thor adult swim sitcom or a doctor who episode. But finally, a climax in a marvel movie is actually the climax. Once led zeppelin kicks in and thor is fighting with his lighting, you get chills. Cate Blanchett does really well, and overall it's a good time. Probably the best marvel movie to watch if you dont want to follow the saga. 82%"
12 November 2017,sijibomi,1,2,6,Law of Diminishing Returns,"Thor Ragnarok is a decent comedy film with a few excellently executed scenes and dialogue, but overall is just another inconsequential MCU entry.

3 November 2017,oazam,0,5,8,Marvel at its finest,"Although I don't fanboy much of Thor much but if Chris Hemsworth stays within the series, it is completely fine for me. From the Thor trilogy until the Avengers trilogy, Thor doesn't disappoint. I was extremely overwhelmed by the trailer of the third film and goody goody that Natalie Portman isn't doing this film. All she does is wear a pair casual clothes and makes out with Thor at the end of the film. Marvel's best film of 2017 after Spider-Man Homecoming.I was extremely grateful when I was saw this film. As a comparison to other films in the trilogy, this one is far yet the best out of the other 2 films. The writing was very smooth and gripping that it will keep you on the edge of your seat for the next 2 hours. VFX was consistent and it gave a clear justification for Marvel Studios when it comes to pre-production- something Fantastic Four failed to comply with back in 2014 during that particular stage.Acting is always a phenomenon in nay specific marvel film of course.Chris Hemsworth keeps his mentality tight when maintaining the role of Thor. He never disappoints a good superhero role especially when spending 15 dollars for a ticket. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is always an entertaining factor for any Marvel film.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was outstanding and some humor was there in the film which I practically enjoyed.Idris Alba and Anthony Hopkins were also delightful throughout the film.Taika Waihiti manages to keep the direction integral to the screenplay of the film. The angles were perfectly adjusted right.The background score and music was amazing and it kinda gives a good vibe to old superhero films in some way.Very colorful setting and I felt that this is also a creative aspect of a film.Overall, just get a ticket and go for this film.4.75/5"

4 May 2018,bentheimpaler,1,2,4,Painful.,"This is a tonally confused conclusion to a tonally confused trilogy. Despite enjoying his role in The Avengers, I never liked the Thor standalone films. Knowing that, I approached this one with a degree of the cynicism I wish I'd had walking into the other two. In this regard, I'm amazed that I managed to be let down anyway.
Like Iron Man 3 or, indeed, the first Thor movie, the story is entirely secondary to how many jokes they can make. This worked for The Guardians of the Galaxy or Fox's Deadpool, but they had the advantage of making up for thin, predictable plots with being funny (even after multiple viewings). But, in this case, the ongoing attempt at humour is largely restricted to ""Expectation vs. Reality"" sight gags or acts of out-of-character incompetence and buffoonery that ruin the tension and lessen the stakes. In effect, the film deflates itself and it's epic mythological roots in favour of ""safely"" playing off the events of the Norse endtimes as a comedy for small children. 
Despite a slew of respected veteran actors, many of the cast seem to be either reading the script off of a teleprompter in real-time for the camera or have been asked to self-deprecatingly improvise in favour of any of the three screenwriters to actually finish a scene. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Ruffalo are all at total lowpoints for their Marvel characterizations thus far, more seeming to be personally goofing off on the occasion that I believe a word they're saying. Again, the pervasive levity renders it impossible to take anything seriously. 
The only reason that this is getting so generous a score is that the visual effects were entirely adequate. Not good, adequate. At it's best, this film is functional. But, on average, it's a choppy mess with mediocre acting from people who desperately deserve a much better script. If you feel the need to not miss any possible reference points in Infinity War, then you could waste your time on something worse, but a technically inferior picture would probably prove more entertaining in a perverse way. It's no weaker than it's titular predecessors, but that means little in the way of enjoyability."

Spectacular CGI, very funny dialpgues, great casting, solid action and awesome soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, was not expecting that at all.Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston have a very natural chemistry between em and are both remarkably funny for action heroes !"
10 December 2019,JustinCampbell11,2,7,8,Not bad but not good,"Despite the many negative reviews surrounding the humor in this film, I was surprised to see that I actually liked it! It's still not that good of a film but once you get into the story, it could be enjoyable."
23 May 2019,abhinavkesamsetty,2,5,8,AN ACTION-PACKED ROLLERCOASTER RIDE,"After two average films, Thor returns with the bang that we all wanted. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a riveting film that features a lot more than our expectations. Marvel made a clever move by showing the funny side of Thor, which is one of the most important aspects of the film. Unlike 'Thor' and 'Thor: The Dark World' which featured Thor as a very serious character, this film has a hilarious version of Thor. But it seems a bit odd. It's because we've seen a serious version of Thor in the previous film, while here, we see Thor cracking jokes at each and every moment. But overall, it works. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett, who plays the role of 'Hela' makes the character one of the best Marvel villains. She's got an interesting story, which every villain is supposed to have. Moreover, the team-up of Thor, Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk is eye-popping and one of the funniest and the most entertaining team-ups ever. Other characters, like the Grandmaster and Korg add an extra bit of humour and energy to this film. The climax is mind-blowing and makes the best use of the 'Immigrant' song.But there are a few issues with Loki. As we've seen in previous Marvel films, Loki was a mischievous and a clever villain, who was so thrilling. But in this film, he's shown as a silly and ridiculous character, who looks like he doesn't give a damn to what's happening around him. I do appreciate the idea of telling this dramatic story in a light-hearted and an amusing way. The execution is appreciable, but at the same time, there are some flaws. The humour is over the top. It kills the drama and the tension.It seems very odd when it constantly switches from drama to comedy. Another part where the film struggles a little is that it just rushes from one plotline to another.Overall, 'Thor: Ragnarok is a huge win for Marvel which presents a lot more than you could expect. It's everything that you would want a superhero film to be. It cannot be missed. There isn't a single point, where the film seems dull and yawn-inducing."
10 March 2018,jeffagle,3,5,4,Jokey and poor CGI,"It's a neat movie, but these days the MCU stands for Marvel Comidic Universe. The CGI is woeful at times. It looks like you're watching a cutscene from 1990s video game."
27 October 2017,juan_grau,11,30,6,To much funny moments,"This is not Thor.it has to much funny moments. For some parts of the movie is OK, but not for almost all of it. The movie misses all the drama and the expectation. It has so much power moments, but the fun in those moments make those parts less intense and dramatic. I missed the old avengers and Thor 1 type of superhero movies."
10 June 2018,jtkirk161,0,4,10,Best Thor movie yet,I absolutely love this movie. Easily the best Thor movie so far and one of the top 10 marvel releases.
24 March 2018,kingitonga,1,2,5,Feeling great disappointment on a movie that had great potential,"First of all, we have different directors and writers working on this from Thor to the Dark World and now Ragnarok, why ? this is the first cause of why Ragnarok tries very well to impress but fails even more!Second, the only good thing i loved was how the story was plotted out, it made sense and the ending and beginning was really good, note, am only taking of plot points in the story which to me is the pillar, very strong.Third, the worst thing, what i really hated!, the jokes, the jokes are too much and spoiling every single bit of seriousness that this movie deserves!, am not saying all jokes aside, some of them are necessary but most of them should have been thrown out! And for this i come back to my first point, i blame the director and writers for making this look like a stupid movie with serious actors in it! am angered by this, and yes i blame the producer too, he saw this and allowed it, you've allowed it to spill into most of your MCU movies and it spoils the good food man!Lastly, jokes are essential for a good movie but not a must, if you want to make serious stuff and make serious money (which am sure you are after), keep the jokes aside man!Honestly being a filmmaker, i wish Ragnarok was written and directed by people trusted to deliver 100% on a good story, even though all other factors and departments fall below par. You had a good story but you spoilt it with the laughs."
6 November 2017,rohitkumarjaju,7,17,10,Must watch movie,"Excellent movie. Nice work by actors and director. Chris done an amazing job playing the action and comedy role as well. Hope Taika Waititi gets more movies to direct in MCU. Cate Blanchett has played character of Hela very well. Missed Lady Sif and Jane Foster. Hulk, Loki and Valkyrie were also excellent."
12 October 2019,boorae,4,14,10,Taika Waititi is a god,One of the best Marvel movies ever made. I would say it's the best if only I would still be able to compare it to the mass of movies the MCU has become by now.
1 February 2018,mts-78680,0,4,7,A Different Kind of Thor,"Marvel is changing directions and hopefully this will not become a normal trend. Great to see a combination of Marvel heroes making cameos but this movie flopped trying to bring back the Thor vs Hulk comedy chemistry. And Loki was barely humorous. Good plot, good special effects and obviously standby for another sequel."
7 August 2018,JackWhitex,4,9,1,Cheap and lazy,"This film is the worst in the franchise so far, awful cgi and a script which makes everyone Jar Jar Binks level annoying. This film reminded me of the awful Star Wars prequels where everyone walked around blue screen sets due to marvel wanting to budget cut. This film is the most overrated film I've ever seen. AwfulThey have ruined the Hulk character."
8 May 2018,Wapucho,1,2,5,"Ok, not as expected","Thor:Ragnarok was just ok for our family. We were disappointed, actually, as the reviews seemed pretty good and some of our friends liked it (though not all). It had an ok start, slow middle, and ok ending. The action could've been better throughout,. Thor (the actor) was good as usual and had some fun lines and a few good action moments. Valkyrie was NOT as good as we heard she was, just ok. Hela was another mediocre villain that showed potential but was beaten way too easily. Hulk's CGI was weird, kind of distracting. The Grandmaster's scenes were fun at times, but the planet scenes (Sakaar) were boring and uninspiring - that middle part was the slowest for my kids as they said they got bored. My wife thought the jokes were too many and made the movie less meaningful overall. All in all it was an ok rental, though we were disappointed thinking this would be much better than it was."

26 February 2018,gigitville,1,5,8,Finally a Good Thor Movie,"So, this movie completely revamped the Thor series, which was direly needed. The first two Thor films were decent in certain ways, but fell flat compared to stand alone films like Iron Man or Captain America. But Ragnarok was so good. It took an entirely comedic approach which surprisingly didn't feel out of place, probably because it was done by someone who had a confidence in their vision. Taika Watiti is a fantastic director. 
Starting with some of the cons, since this was more of a comedy, and since it was done well, some of the jokes actually felt a little cheap in comparison to others. For example, in the first scene when Thor is talking to Surtur and spins in the chains during the discussion. The first time viewing, it was pretty funny. But it wasn't the type of humor that aged well with multiple viewings. This was sprinkled throughout the film, but luckily not the main sense of humor. The main sense of humor was cleverer, i.e. Korg who was one of the best parts of the movie with his oddly chipper New Zealander voice, played by Taika Watiti. Speaking of, I wish he had complete creative control, because you could see at times where the studios were whispering in his ear of what the movie ""should"" have. I really wish they developed Cate Blanchett and her character more. The way she played the character varied a bit scene to scene, which could be chalked up to the studios interfering with the directing and writing. And the villain itself should've been given some more depth. Come on, Marvel. I know you can't go back into previous Marvel movies and change things, but it would've been nice to see Thor actually use lightning earlier in the Cinematic Universe. Though, one could argue that his abilities change as he discovers more about himself. There should've been more of the story taking place on Sakaar, since it was such an interesting world that was actually well developed. 
It was where the movie really embraced itself was where it was most successful. The weird and funny moments were its strongest supporters of the story. The color was also great, and just the whimsical tone actually felt more Thor. His character is a stubborn and arrogant prince in the first film, and in Dark World, an argument can be made that that was where he was dealing with some internal conflict, and now, after spending time with the Avengers on earth, the more fun tone is fitting since he's loosened up. It surprisingly fit well with the timeline of Thor. And it was refreshing that Thor was trying to save his world, but had to change his game plan, and Asgard ended up destroyed. The way they used color in the film with Loki makes me hopeful. He wasn't in his usual green and black, the colors he always reverted back to when he would betray Thor, but he's in teal. This could represent that he's truly changed for good, and hopefully won't betray Thor again in Infinity War. 
Overall, fantastically enjoyable movie that was made extremely well by a director who had a vision. The clever sense of humor and 80's-esque music was awesome, as well as the completely badass second use of Immigrant Song with Thor using lightning."
12 December 2018,robrace-77501,6,13,1,When did Thor become Deadpool?,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It was forced humor constantly.For Deadpool or Guardians, the cheap comedy works. That does not mean it needs to be the recipe for every movie. The thing that makes all the MCU movies great is that they are different with different styles and different characters.They ruined it.I really have nothing more to say. Sad."

18 September 2020,butecxnki,4,13,2,Is it because I am older than 5??,"That I dislike this film and everything Marvel puts out?
Childish jokes, standard issue cliche-ridden nonsense lines, no relation to the comics or the mythology and instead one-liner after one-liner and the complete asphyxiation and suffocation o any character that matters.
Hey Disney, not everything is a joke for idiots with an IQ of 25 to laugh at."
11 November 2017,tughan_a,1,8,8,Entertaining,"This is not my type of Marvel movie, however i must say it was quite entertaining to watch this movie. First of all there are quite some reference in the jokes and the dialogs in the script and this is more of a Guardians of the Galaxy version of Thor series... and i must say it was very different than the previous movies of this series. Still there was kinda rush feeling in the movie as in Assassins Creed which was not so cool in my opinion... I always prefer a better historical narrative all the time..Anyway overall 8/10 , its worth to watch in cinema in my opinion."

If You are wondering ""should i see this movie?"" and You dont care much about Batmans, Spidermans, Thors etc. but You watch this type of movies sometimes anyway? Then this is a movie for You. Its funny in a silly way but common. They should make movies like this always funny. How much hardcore fanatics are there? Like 2% of all revenue? This kind of movies is made in 90% for kids so the least they could do is make it bearable (funny) for older people to watch it. If You are hardcore fan You already saw it and You hated it. I feel sorry for You amigo. Now stop crying and go back to watching LoL on twitch. Dont forget your energy drink!"
2 November 2017,regula1,0,6,8,By Far the Best Solo Thor Film,"X-Men Apocalypse was wrong: the third film in the franchise isn't always the worst.Thor (2010) was a perfectly doable, if average, origin film and served the purpose of introducing the character in time for The Avengers. Thor: The Dark World (2014) wasn't terrible, but it was very disappointing and bland.Thor: Ragnarok, on the other hand, is just the kind of film to get audiences to like an Avenger other than Tony Stark or Steve Rogers.Directed by Taika Waititi, this film gets an injection of the cosmic vibe from James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films and uses it to go crazy and have some fun showing how bizarre the universe can be.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has had his hammer shattered by Hela, Goddess of Death (Cate Blanchett) and been banished to a world where he is enslaved and forced to fight for his survival. Now, he must assemble a team to save the people of Asgard from Hella's evil reign and the oncoming apocalypse, Ragnarok, with a little help from Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, with extra Hulk voice time for Lou Ferrigno).As a comic book film, this checks all the correct buttons for a conflict that has serious stakes yet with enough levity to balance out the deadly threats the characters face. It genuinely feels like anything can happen, and often unexpected things do happen.This is obviously a tonally different film from the first two Thor films, looking and feeling more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film. The fact that this is much more of a success than the first two films may mean that more levity may be in store for future Marvel films.However, with a film with this much humor, while the majority of the jokes land on their feet, it does sometimes tend to inject a funny moment when more seriousness is required, and this can be emotionally confusing and ultimately undermining the stakes set earlier in the film.Also, there are some major family conflicts that get introduced quickly, brushed aside for large stretches, and then barely brought up again before being forgotten an instant later. Some shattering revelations are not given the proper impact that they are due. Out of the film's weaknesses, this feels like the most disappointing, as these themes could and should have done more to balance out the film's serious-funny dynamic.Overall, though, this film does a lot for the franchise in that for the length of a film, much like the Guardians films, the audience can largely forget about the overarching MCU timeline and events and focus on the story at hand, and while it has its deficiencies, this is still a fun film and one that will probably be the fun crescendo before the probably overly serious Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War films."
4 November 2017,jsbear-4-320623,2,6,8,"I could care less about Marvel or Thor, but this was a good movie.","I went in with little expectations, to be honest, I figured it would be more of the same. The casting for this movie was very good, loved Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and Tessa Thompson. Movie has a solid plot, great action, great humor, and above average acting. Kind of has that Guardians of the Galaxy comedic aspect to it.Worth a watch, and believe me I'm not up to speed on everything Marvel, but still was presently surprised.Enjoy :)"

                        ",Monstrous development of both characters and industry,"Taika Waititi was assigned to the role of director for the new Thor film following the success of his comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Thor continues from the success of the previous Avengers films as well as the previous two Thor films, obvious from the various references present, but not completely necessary in the enjoyment-factor. Waititi, given the reins of one of the most anticipated films of the year, declared that, he would add comedy in this new installation, with Waititi himself voicing the funniest character of the film, Korg, a stone-skinned humanoid. Waititi's vision was brought to fruition through the triplet of writer's who successfully employed a range of comedy rarely endeavoured in superhero films.Starring in the satisfying, unconvoluted plot, is Chris Hemsworth continuing his role of Thor accompanied by a new makeover and a monstrous power. With a guest appearance from Mark Ruffalo, continuing as Hulk, the film had everything going for it; it was promising. This regularly comedic script was, despite it's strengths, boring and sluggish for the first quarter, but revives itself quickly, and in parts, completely captures one's interest. With great acting from Chris Hemsworth, the Hulk felt overused in (a particular section of) the film and, in some Bruce Banner rather than Hulk sections, Mark Ruffalo's performance was not up to scratch. The films also possessed annoying and cliché ""tough-girls"" in Tessa Thompson's 'Valkyrie' and Cate Blanchett's 'Hela', the antagonist of the film.The script also undertakes extravagant, exaggerated battle sequences which, most of the time, aren't interesting (basically, any without Thor - bias?). But, Korg (the comedic rock-man) helps to lift the film as does the highly satisfying final battle and Thor's monstrous development."
19 June 2019,tkbludis,1,8,9,Super funny!,"Thor Ragnarok is the Thor film that we needed. Coming off of the mediocre Thor The Dark World, I didn't know if this film would be that great. And I was very satisfied with this movie. The first two films seemed a tad bit too dark. But this film was taken into a more colorful and light-hearted direction. This film is really funny, the action was very entertaining, but most importantly, this film made Thor a more likable character. However I do think that Jeff Goldblum was underused though. Overall Thor Ragnarok is great and super funny."
7 April 2019,ayshikr8,2,8,9,Hela kills it!,"I know that the movie is about thor, but Hela is the one who steals the show! Cate Blanchett was the star of the movie for me, not Chris Hemsworth. The Goddess of Death deserved a single movie( come on! If venom gets his own movie, why not Hela?)!Now, about the movie, even though it didn't stand up to many people's expectation and lacked depth of the story line, it was fun to watch!"
2 November 2017,TheJediWay9,0,7,9,"The Best of The Thor Movies, And Definitely One Of The Best of Phase 3","""Thor: Ragnarok"" is the third Thor movie and 17th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Ragnarok, Thor, captured on a remote planet and forced to enter a gladiator match against the Hulk, must find a way to get back to Asgard to stop Hela, the goddess of death, from destroying it and bringing about the prophesied ""Ragnarok.""To be honest I haven't seen a Thor movie in the theaters. i missed out on chances to see both of them so I was really excited to see this one, despite thinking ""The Dark World"" is average at best. I was really happy. This is some of the most fun I've had all year. Thor actually feels like a character in this film. His dialogue feels more real and natural and I think that's because we've seen him adapting to other realms like Earth in previous films. it felt so genuine and I was happy that he used more of his power rather just swing his hammer around for most of the movie. They made Thor a character, someone you could relate to. The biggest thing this movie has going for it is the fact they took Earth away as the setting. Setting it in the cosmos is exactly what the Thor movies needed, and what should have been done with the second movie. No offense to Natalie Portman, but I'm glad she didn't come back. The story didn't call for it and she wasn't needed.This is a very fun, exciting, and funny film. There are scenes where you are dying of laughter. The action sequences, as always in a Marvel film, are fun to watch. there's a lot of great scenery to go along with those and this is a very colorful movie, which added to the overall visual appeal.The new characters were very well integrated and really likable. My favorite was Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson. She did a fabulous job and the character had more of a wild side to her than I was expecting, and that was a nice touch. Jeff Goldblum surprisingly didn't annoy me. There's only so much of him I can handle and he was handled in a way where he was tolerable.Hela was a good villain as well. Not the best, but a lot stronger than most MCU villains, a new trend that Marvel seems to be making sure that they are doing. Cate Blanchett does a very good job and looks like she is having a lot of fun in the role. Hela isn't in the movie a lot, but is in it just enough. She's perfectly functional and more menacing than one might expect.As for issues, they're only very minor. One was the CGI in a couple of scenes was weak, and I didn't really like the character of Skurge. I found him to be kind of bland. I had a blast with this movie. It is my second favorite of phase 3 and one of my favorites in the MCU.I am going to give ""Thor: Ragnarok"" an A.

4 November 2017,grantbell-85547,2,5,6,CAMPY but fun.,"This movie was a straight up comedy first above all other things. And the humor is the type that is only funny the first time you see the movie, possibly the second. After that, the jokes will never be funny again. The crowning achievement for me in this movie is that Cate Blanchett is smoking hot. She is the sexiest I have EVER seen her. I wish she had more screen time. She had very little screen time. I see from reading the top reviews that a bunch of children and teenagers think this is the greatest movie ever made. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA! If you are slightly older and moderately mature, I believe you will agree with me that this movie is CAMPY, but still fun. It is worth seeing one time, but not a movie that requires ANY thinking on your behalf."
1 June 2018,TheNameBrand,0,3,9,Absolute Favorite,"This is by far the best of the 3 Thor films. It was different and had an interesting/unique vibe to it, but I think the risk they took on that paid off nicely. Soundtrack was great, the fight scenes incredible. I'd put this on the same level as Winter Soldier, and it's in my top 5 favorite Marvel films, as of 1 June 2018."
24 October 2019,yeolit,0,1,6,Enjoyable if taken with a pinch of salt (or a lot),"From the beginning, it has been kind of confusing, maybe because I had forgotten what went on before this started. There were quite a few scenes where even Thor was confused about why some things are in certain ways but hey, it is just how it is right? Quite a lot of things were never explained clearly.Besides, the thing about Hera seems like a side-story, she was never mentioned, and all of a sudden she is so amazing. Again, even Thor was surprised. And a lot of the concepts in this movie seem quite new as well.Character development wise, it's just a bunch of strange happenings (imagine, Hulk was smiling and happy), plot armor and sudden power-ups. Well, if some of those stuff had proper explanations, it'd be good and all, but many were just ""well just accept it"", hence the pinch of salt needed. Loki is loki as usual, incomprehensible and a catalyst of chaos as usual.In conclusion, either a movie marathon is needed to understand some of the stuff that happened, or basically just take it as a standalone movie but prepare popcorn... oops, I mean salt, to pinch while watching this film."
31 March 2018,wobbs1,1,2,7,A great change to over complicated sequels,Loved this film. Belly laughed the whole way through. I have always hated the way many Marvel sequels over complicate themselves with in-depth story lines and rushed introductions of too many characters. This was a refreshing change to the bogged down Avengers and Thor story lines.

12 November 2017,jdogkg,1,6,8,Yet another home run by marvel!,"Thor 1 and 2 are usually thought of as the weakest in the MCU. Those movies are still good, but I do have to agree with that statement. So I am very happy to tell you, this movie is such a step up from 1 and 2! It's a rare example of the 3rd installment being the best in the trilogy (marvel also did that with civil war). Thor ragnarok has such a unique plot and expands the universe with endless creativity which was my favorite part of the whole movie! As always Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were fantastic as Thor and Loki. They had awesome chemistry together. The villain, I am happy to announce had motivation and development to her. They have a reason for her to be evil. I have a few issues of the movie like the villain doesn't get much screen time in the first two acts. Also, they didn't developed a threat or conflict to well in the first two acts. But the final battle is amazing with some emotional weight put into it as well. All in all Thor Ragnarok is such a fun ride! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"

                        ",A Warning To All,"Disney is not just digging its own grave by destroying character after character after character (they already destroyed and crushed Star Wars, made Thor the god of thunder an inept joke of a baboon, made Iron Man a prankster with marbles loose, etc etc) but alsod estroying cinema and film for all.
In other words, no one will want to go to cinema anymore ever. It is all stupid out-of-character idiots and sequels, universe and mash-ups.
Here not only is Thor unaware what god he is and what his powers are, the standard issue Disney princess shows up and dominates all the men and everyone (yes the masses) of Norsemen are easily deluded by a shyster and none is the wiser.
If there is a Valhalla Disney and its wisecrack idiots will have a lot to answer for."

20 February 2018,rowdy_top,1,3,6,Nice try but no Cigar,"First off: I am not familiar with the world of Thor in the comic books unlike the other MCU heroes. However I have seen the other 2 Thor movies and as such this is the best or at least the most entertaining one of the bunch. It leans heavy on the comedy side of things and there is the strength and the weakness of the movie. Obviously Marvel and Disney have found that it pays to be funny. Unfortunately they haven't got it completely right. And the fact that you have a truck load of money to waste on nothing doesn't mean you can make it any good. It's just plain lucky the other 2 were bad that in comparison this one looks better but in reality it is just average. Do not expect to be dazzled by the story, the visuals, the scenery or anything else you may want to be flabbergasted by. This is another one you have seen without having to see it. The formula gets old but I guess that as long as they cash in big time they will be made. There is nothing wrong with that but why not take a chance, try something different or just spent some time for a better story or at least a better dialogue. MCU movies are rapidly becoming fast food and that is a shame. If the production outcome is so generic what is the point to show up for the next in the Marvel franchise."

                        ","Visually Stunning, Great Acting. Too bad the story just fell flat","Seems to be a recent trend in adventure/superhero movies to have this theme of diversity and multiculturalism and tolerance as this pinnacle of a society, and the villain or conflict coming from those who want to resist that.Fine, if you're five years old. But if anyone has paid any attention to global events over the past, say, five years, open borders hasn't exactly worked out so good and in fact is quite disastrous for those having to live 'on the ground level.'So, basically, I am saying that I wish the producers would give the audience some credit and start writing some stories that actually reflect the world we are living in, if only allegorically through these movies."

2 August 2018,hiero66,1,3,10,Amazing Movie!!!,I really loved this movie and am stunned by the negative reviews. It wasn't dark and depressing enough from what I'm reading. I think people are getting way too artsy fartsy for their own good and can't enjoy anything anymore unless it is truly esoteric. This was a blast and I really enjoyed it!
16 April 2018,nat-dalby,1,3,8,A rare original-feeling film from Marvel,"Quite comfortably one of the best Marvel films, mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously at all. One of the best things Marvel has done to its films is hire directors with strong styles like Shane Black, James Gunn and Taika Waititi that let the films actually have some personality. Thor: Ragnarok looks incredible, has a neat synthy soundtrack and is packed with jokes. Only gripes I would have is that the main villain is a little under-baked considering she's supposed to be Thor's actual sister, with most of the film not focused on what she's doing. I also wish they'd kept the Hulk a secret, because it comes out of absolutely nowhere and would have been an insane surprise if he hadn't been on the poster."
31 January 2018,mik_mik_90,1,3,5,"For an MCU movie, this is Thor-lerable","Maybe I am the most boring human being in the world for not laughing in this movie. Hell, others would hate me for it. But for the record, I would like say that I really enjoy the MCU ever since The Incredible Hulk back in 2008. I do like the humor of MCU and I also enjoyed Taika Waititi's ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" but this Thor: Ragnarok just didn't work for me. I think the set/props and some CGI part looks fake, I kinda zoned out when they were in Sakaar because it was too caricature for me. That planet didn't feel authentic, from the costume design to the set, it was almost a sitcom level to me, a high-budgeted sitcom. The main problem for me is the fact that this is a comedy movie first before a superhero movie. The humor in this movie is really really predictable, like MCU humor predictable. So I've seen it all coming. What I like about this movie though is Cate Blanchett's Hela, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Story wise I think it was interesting, I mean I finished the whole film but I was not satisfied with the finished product. Maybe I am just having a superhero fatigue after almost a decade of following MCU. I don't know. But I am pumped up for the next chapter which is the Black Panther."

There is a lot of humor and it fits well in the setting (does not break the immersion).The drama is also fine and relevant. An overall good story."

16 June 2018,tvsterling,1,7,9,The Return of SHOWMANSHIP,"There are three elements I see in these new CGI Era movies which have been getting more & more powerful as the technology & The Techniques to use it mature. In my opinion Marvel Studios is very close to perfecting technique for this new Era of movies. Two of the elements are as old as movies; Music & dialogue. The third; CGI is only a couple three decades old. Previously many CGI driven movies have been dominated by Eye-Candy; Using the CGI as the main character & skimping on the rest of the movie. As an off/on computer gamer I can tell you that Eye-Candy will only get you so far. This makes for very pretty but unsatisfying movies. Call these latest Marvel Studios Movies ""THE RETURN OF SHOWMANSHIP."" What has been REBORN is the skillful addition of Music & Dialogue with a healthy dose of craftsmanship. Not only This Movie here but other Marvel shows such as Guardians of The Galaxy. Trademarks of classic Hollywood movies were snappy, clever dialogue, well integrated music & pure craftsmanship. Music really stands out here; this new style of movie is sometimes a MUSIC VIDEO. How many generations are we now into MTV & music videos? Some of the battle scenes with Led Zeppelins 'Immigrant Song' are absolutely stunning & they are MUSIC VIDEOS TOO. Music is every bit as powerful, no more powerful, than any CGI Eye Candy. The Guardians of the Galaxy Movies go even further in this direction. Plenty of old favorite songs (mine anyway) & lots of them. These movies ARE Musicals in a way. 'Sound of Music' has it's place but SO STICKY SWEET; man nothing Rocks in there. The old tradition of snappy Hollywood Dialogue has been sadly neglected too. I am always laughing out loud at some sly clever line in these latest Marvel Movies. Even Jeff Goldblum's voice as 'Grandmaster' cracks me up. Old 30's & 40's movies had lots of cool snappy lines. It really went downhill after The Schwarzenegger movies with their ""One Big Line"" like ""I'll be Back. later there were not even any,""One big Lines"". Doesn't take much to find & hire some good, clever writers; get a clue. Don't misunderstand me CGI has become an increasingly more powerful tool but these movies restore the balance & really advance the artform. One thing It is Very Hard for any Flesh & Blood actor to stand up to CGI & not be dwarfed by it on screen; That means Actors like Goldblum, Blanchette & Hopkins. This type of movie I call 'Rollercoaster Style'; Designed like a thrill park ride. All action, frantic action with no let-up. Makes for great old time escapism. Movies are supreme at escape. Graphic Novels also have the advantage of being totally visual in nature. GO MARVEL this is an exceedingly powerful way to harness the medium for fun & profit."

3 March 2018,gavin-95069,2,4,7,Nothing Special,"When I see movies that are rated 8.0 and higher I assume that they're exceptional and thus worth the watch. This movie, however, was not exceptional. Jeff Goldbloom and Chris Hemsworth had solid performances and overall I liked the banter, but it was really just an average superhero movie. The only other superhero movie I can recall being rated 8.0+ was Logan, and after watching it I had to agree that it was worth the high score - but after watching Thor: Ragnarok I'm a bit skeptical of what criteria these critics are using."

                        ",This film was pure gold(blum),"It is one of those marvellous films that place no strain on your focus because it is relentlessly entertaining. It still looks very much like a marvel film but has somehow managed to achieve a superb balance of combining the dry humoured, quirky identity of a smaller Waititi film with the large marvel proportions. There seemed to be a different comedic set up in each scene almost like a sketch show and in general the film felt almost more like a comedy then an action film in terms of genre. It was really great to see Chris Hemsworth showing his skills as a comedy actor and it wasn't just down to the moments of genius within the written dialogue as Hemsworth shows he has a really funny instinct and great use of physical humour. A great quality of the film too was how meta and self deprecating the characters where and it gave the villains in particular more depth. This was particularly in the case of 'Hella' (Cate Blanchett). Hellas darkness and power are presented alongside moments that ridicule her failed attempts to demand respect. The film also uses its special effects in a spectacularly creative ways. When Hellas Hair turns to horns it is a beautifully fluid action that for some reason caused certain people in the screen I was in to exclaim ""GO KATE"" I don't think they necessarily thought it was the actress's personal skill, but I understand the sentiment. her whole performance was great! there is something about her which really commands your full focus whenever she is on screen. My only criticism would be I would have liked to have seen more Blanchet. I also really felt with this film that the SciFi moments where constructed with great tangibility. Everything in this film looked touchable and correctly weighted which is rare for a glossary high CGI Blockbuster. There is a visually interesting scene taking place in a festival for the Hulk and everything looked like a real life spectacle and yet had the convincing feel of a far away planet. I think what Waititi proves with this film is that he is very accomplished as an action director as well as with comedy as he uses the action sequences to showcase his creative ingenuity. In a flash back scene the texture of the action is that of an old dramatic oil painting in which a fight involving the Valkyries is taking place. The dramatic lighting design in this scene beautifully impressive. Whether a marvel nerd a Waititi fan a comedy snob or just someone who needs escaping into another world for a few hours; this film is well worth the watch!"
2 May 2018,olovsimonsson,0,1,4,Not sure what I just saw.,"I must admit that I have grown tired of Marvel movies. The extended universe not only entails that every movie and character must be connected, but also that you can't see a Marvel movie without having to see all of them in order to understand the context. I have seen all (I think, but frankly I can't be sure anymore, as they tend to blend together). Most of them are enjoyable to watch, but they do not offer much in the sense of emotion or thought, which means they are easily forgettable.In this case, I had no idea what had preceded the movie (yes, I saw Age of Ultron, but still have no idea how Bruce Banner ended up in space). And in fact I am still not sure if I saw a Marvel movie or a parody of a Marvel movie. There was so much that did not add up, so much that was too silly or anachronistic to make any sense. Sure, I laughed at times, but I that's pretty much all the emotion this movie got from me. It's not bad, it's entertaining at times, but it didn't really make much sense, and it certainly did not make me think enough to believe that I will remember any of it tomorrow. In conclusion, this movie tries hard to recreate the combination of humor and action that worked very well with Guardians of the Galaxy, but fails."
3 November 2017,travishouze,0,5,7,Thor is a Colorful Ride Through the Cosmos,"While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has created some great blockbuster highs, it has has its share of lows as well. The one superhero out of all the members who tends to get the short end of the stick is the God of Thunder himself Thor. While his debut film wasn't bad, it was filled with hit and miss cinematography and frankly a love story that was just unnecessary. And Thor: The Dark World...... i just act like that movie didn't happen at all. So Thor: Ragnarok had to inject some needed energy to catch up to his fellow peers.In this film, we find Thor (Chris Helmsworth) searching for his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and comes across the Goddess of Death Hela (Cate Blanchett) who threatens Thor's homeland Asgard of Ragnarok, which means the extinction of their land. Most of the time Thor is exiled to Sakaar, a very eccentric land and comes across Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) as they find a way back home.One thing I will admit is this is the first time a Thor movie put this much effort to keep you entertained. Tessa Thompson delivers a energized performance and I'm happy to see her getting recognition. Jeff Goldblum is just as lively who just bleeds a ""Yas Queen"" kind of personality every time he's on screen. Thor has a a character seems more relaxed and less like the macho character we got used to him being.However, the film isn't without flaws. While there are moments where the cinematography can have great visual moments, there are certain shots that look very rushed blue screen edit. The villain, while she has a interesting backstory, doesn't really bring too much of a lasting impact like most Marvel movies tends to be. Also there's a relatively big thing in the 3rd act that happens ( i won't spoil i swear), but it happens so fast and the film rushes by it, that it doesn't feel as important as it feels like it should be.Thor Ragnarok is a colorful cosmic ride, but still misses some lasting impact on certain points. If you have seen enough Marvel Cinematic Universe films, you know what to expect walking in and shouldn't be disappointed.Rating: 7.4 / 10"

30 December 2018,gunrlife,4,9,2,Slapstick!,"The subject could have made this movie an epic, ya know, like a Norse epic saga! If they had made a movie that made the subject matter the substance of the film with some well place comic relief to break the tension it could have been a great film. This was nothing but slapstick and campy old jokes."

Therefore I've been suffering a range of TV and film to get through the long evenings that stretch out before me. I'd nearly given up hope on the pastime and then I watched this film. This film is simply good entertainment, not to mention superbly funny (in a nice heartwarming way). No wine required. Thanks, next."

2 November 2017,hollywoodhernandez-70868,1,9,9,Best Marvel comic book movie since Iron Man,"In the new Thor movie Chris Hemsworth returns as ""The God of Thunder"" but this time around he's evolved from the big lug in the original movie into a more all around character with a wider range of emotions. With credit to Hemsworth the new Thor is funnier and has more emotions than in the previous Thor movie. He's even gotten a haircut.In Thor Rangarok Thor returns home to Asgardian to find Loki (Tom Hiddleston) up to his old tricks. He's faked his own death and is posing as the king, his father (Anthony Hopkins). He's also sent his father off to another realm (an old folks home in New York). So Thor and Loki head off to find their father but when they find him his life force is fading and before he dies he tells his sons that they have an evil, all powerful sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who they never knew existed. Hela returns to Asgardin to claim the crown that she thinks is rightfully hers. With her evil powers she's able to bring her former army back to life and, backed by her army of zombies, she sets out to conquer every realm and to be the most powerful queen in the entire universe. However, her plans run into a roadblock when Heimdall (Idris Elba) comes out of hiding and steals the key that will allow her to leave the realm of Asgard. Meanwhile, Thor's return is delayed after he is captured by a female bounty hunter, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson from Creed), and sold to ""Grandmaster"" (Jeff Goldblum) who entertains his realm by staging gladiator fights. Captives can only be set free by defeating the sitting champion, who just happens to be an old friend of Thor's, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The two ""Avengers"" end up teaming up and returning to Asgard to save the people of the realm and to do battle with the evil queen Hela. It's really a straight forward story that is easy to follow on the big screen (shown in IMAX 3D). I think this is the best Marvel comic book movie since the original Iron Man. Although no explanation is given in the movie of the word ""Rangarok"" it has to do with Germanic mythology and refers to the end of the world for the gods and resurfacing new and fertile again. Seems like a good title because Thor Rangarok is a breath of fresh air from the often complicated and hard to follow super hero movie. It's rated PG-13 and has a run time of 2 hours and 10 minutes (which passes really quickly). On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I give this movie my highest rating a JUMBO (with extra butter)! There is a funny bonus scene that appears after the movies' credits so be sure and stay until the very end. Hollywood Hernandez"
20 November 2017,frankmedic,3,6,5,decent but disappointing,The movie was made into a comedy! This was a Bleak and Dark story in the comic book! If you never read the comic book series that this was LOOSELY based on you'll like it better than those who did.

2 October 2018,jackthecoward,2,6,7,Good fun,"It's a film that's more about fun than thinking or engaging you in story. That was my opinion anyway - perhaps the more you know about the comics, the less impressed you are I'm guessing."
23 May 2019,abhinavkesamsetty,2,6,8,AN ACTION-PACKED ROLLERCOASTER RIDE,"After two average films, Thor returns with the bang that we all wanted. Taika Waititi has brought us what could be the best Marvel film yet. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a riveting film that features a lot more than our expectations. Marvel made a clever move by showing the funny side of Thor, which is one of the most important aspects of the film. Unlike 'Thor' and 'Thor: The Dark World' which featured Thor as a very serious character, this film has a hilarious version of Thor. But it seems a bit odd. It's because we've seen a serious version of Thor in the previous films, while here, we see Thor cracking jokes at each and every moment. But overall, it works. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett, who plays the role of 'Hela' makes the character one of the best Marvel villains. She's got an interesting backstory, which every villain is supposed to have. Moreover, the team-up of Thor, Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk is eye-popping and one of the funniest and the most entertaining team-ups ever. Other characters, like the Grandmaster and Korg add an extra bit of humour and energy to this film. The climax is absolutely spell-bounding and is a game-changer to the MCU.But there are a few issues with Loki. As we've seen in previous Marvel films, Loki was a mischievous and a clever villain, who was so thrilling. But in this film, he's shown as a silly and a ridiculous character, who looks like he doesn't give a damn to what's happening around him. Another thing that doesn't work in this film is that it keeps changing its tone. The film has some funny sequences and some dramatic sequences. The filmmakers couldn't mix these very well. Many scenes of the film look fast-paced and rushed.Overall, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a huge win for Marvel which presents a lot more than you could expect. It's everything that you would want a superhero film to be. It cannot be missed. There isn't a single point, where the film seems dull and yawn-inducing."

27 June 2022,jahnu-14536,0,0,7,Is it funny or not? Up to you.,"In my opinion, the jokes and humorous nature of Thor: Ragnarok didn't fit the universe Marvel set up over years and years of movies. It came from left field and just didn't feel very funny. Some swear by this film and say it's one of the best Marvel films made, but I feel like it used humor to make up for the fact the plot was lackluster and couldn't keep one entertained for longer than an hour.That being said, it's a Marvel film - the visuals are fantastic and the characters are fun. It almost feels like a side quest, and it's a good time. Still falls short of the best of the Marvel films though."

The story is solid. I could have done without the extra rainbow-ish 80's synth style but the characters are great. The Grand Master role though is weak but other characters make up for it.

2 November 2017,Dimitris_Kountouris,1,6,8,Best Thor Movie!,"Even though the previous two installments were mediocre, I knew Thor: Ragnarok would be superior (just after I watched the trailers) and, thank God, I was right.I'll start with the worst part of the movie: the humor. No, the humor wasn't necessarily bad, there were some hilarious scenes and lines, but there were, also, some ridiculous ones too, in the wrong moments. It was just too much. Personally, I prefer comic book movies with humor, not comedies with superheroes, and Thor: Ragnarok was the second one. If you are not Guardians of the Galaxy, don't try it...Thor: Ragnarok is colorful, adventurous and fun, different than the average MCU movie. It makes us feel that not all MCU films are the same and that they are evolving, that they have their own identity. The fight sequences were great. The choreography, the directing, everything. They made me experience some of the most intense fight scenes in the MCU. Both the Thor vs Hulk and final battle scenes were extremely enjoyable.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as the God of Thunder and I'll say the same thing about Tom Hiddleston as Loki (yeah, he steals the show AGAIN) and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.Speaking of Hulk's alter ego, I loved the Green Giant. He was... meh in the previous movies, but this time the motion capture does a great job of showing us more expressions and emotion from Hulk and it's something that I was waiting for, for a long time.About the villain... Cate Blanchett was absolutely superb as Hela, the Goddess of Death! From now on, she is in the list of my top MCU villains, alongside Loki and Michael Keaton's Vulture. She doesn't need a great motive, or a great character development. She is the Goddess of Death and that's itAbout the ending: I think no one saw that coming."

24 January 2018,maxigarciasoto,1,6,10,Thor: Ragnarok - Movie review,"I wasn't a big fan of Thor. I thought that he was just another powerful character to fulfill the avengers crew. That were my thoughts on him until i watched this film. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is my second favorite marvel film next to ""Captain America: Civil War"", this film did what Winter Soldier did for Captain America back in 2014. That was my exact reaction with this film.""Thor: Ragnarok"" is about Thor and how he has to stop Hella, the goddess of death portrait by Cate Blanchett. That is really the plot of this film, is really simple, but the thing that makes this film so great is the thing that does to the Thor character, it changes completely. In this film, Thor is really the god of thunder, is not just a person with a big hammer flying around. This guy is now a true god, and a really badass one. And that is thanks to the way this character is written and with Chris Hemsworth's performance, makes Thor a really awesome avenger, and one that you can relate to. Talking about the performances in this film, they were all very good, Mark Ruffalo, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, even Tika Waititi as Korg, was phenomenal. Jeff Goldblum as a Grandmaster, was amazing, as well as Cate Blanchett as Hella. Tom Hiddleston is once again great as Loki, and i love the ark between him and Thor. I also like the way the handle Heimdall in this film, he was great and Idris Elba is very good here.Another big thing that makes this film really great, is the fact that is so funny and is such a great time, there is barely a moment when you're bored in ""Thor: Ragnarok"". The other Thor films were serious and at times, i wasn't too invested on the story. Here in ""Ragnarok"" is the other way around, this film completely changes everything, the tone, the score, which by the way is great, is like earing a score for a sci-fi movie from the 80's.So in the end, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was the type of film i was expecting since i first saw the trailer, it gave me what i wanted and more, it was funny, is was an incredible experience, and i truly recommend that you watch it even if you are not a big comic book movie fan. And this movie truly deserves a 10/10."

26 May 2018,strassermarlies,0,2,9,My favorite MCU movie,"Let's be honest, it was silly. But it was extremly cool too. So many people on Imdb try to rate a movie ""objectively"" like there are some guidelines that decide what a good movie has to look like. When you get older and have seen thousands of movies, you will know, at the end of the day, the most important thing is the enjoyment you get by watching it. And I enjoyed this movie A LOT. I watched it three times, some scenes even more often. It was not a perfect movie by any means. They overdid it with the humour several times. The serious scenes were done very well, but again, they inserted a joke to ruin it all. I just wish they would have edited a bit differently, some scenes were not needed. But despite its flaws it was a very fun and colorful movie. A movie that Chris Hemsworth deserved after all this years playing the rather simple minded and dull Thor. After Ragnarok and Infinity War Thor is now one of the most beloved (and coolest) heroes. They really made something good here."

But Kate Blanchett is such a gem my eyes get wet.
When she enters as a baddie i cry, ok.
And T Thompson is just such a creampuff of acting her work with Mark Ruffalos cgi work is just amazin...
But Taika he is Korg. And he is always pushin Rachel Houze so, respect and beware of the melting stick...
But back to Korg,Maybe he is better than Groot the old, but he looks like my wart on my knee, his skin does."
10 November 2018,dmnqsmth89,2,4,9,Finally: strong women in a Thor film,Exponentially better than the first two films. Women were finally given a real place in the story and it made such a huge difference. Taika Waititi is brilliant and his sense of humor in addition to the female presence makes the movie awesome.
3 November 2017,sanjusupercool1,0,12,10,Truly spectacular,"Thor Ragnarok is the third film in the Thor series and is easily the best in the series .In fact for me this is easily one of the best of MCU . The story line and structure of the movie is great as usual . The direction is also great.Tom hiddleston and Chris hemsworth were amazing and the new cast members like Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett were great . I especially liked Tessa Thompsons character and found it to be a superior character to the previous love interest Jane . While i like Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor strange i did not like the segment where Doctor Strange is in the movie , it was a little too fast paced.The characters of Korg and Skurge were good and were given sufficient time. Overall i loved the entire movie except the part where doctor strange is in it. Hulk was good but the character of Bruce was not given a huge time with which is understandable since the movie already had a lot of character. A very fun time and a great experience . Would recommend it to all."
30 May 2019,jamielee_uob,1,7,9,Thorsome Ragnarok,"Thor Ragnarok... A stunning ConclusionThis is how to do a movie and mix superheroes! Whilst the only negative is the exclusion of Natalie Portman...the rest more than makes up for it. An exciting storyline which left me hooked and the action scenes were visually stunning. The mix of Thor and Hulk is a surprising plus, and works well here.The fantasy element probably does overstep the mark a little, but that's what Thor does! A mix of emotions with the ending heightens the thrill of the film...yet for all the thrilling action and epic scenery...what makes this Marvel film standout from some others is the comedy element. Not often do Marvel pull it off, especially in a film without Downey Jr, but here they have and with great effect. This compliments the storyline perfectly and adds that joyous smile to our faces!Overall, this is an epic film for me and is definitely up there with some of the better films...
J Boss Reviews gives 8.7/10"
5 November 2017,mhts323,1,3,7,Thor: Ragnarok,"Where should I start? The progression of his character is downright amazing. Backed up by the Immigrant Song, he is introduced in the beginning as a glorified martyr with a signature weapon and soon after, forced to step out of his stereotypical hero-shoes and we finally get to see a redeemed version: cropped hair (his only physical source of dignity lost), permanently outgrowing the influence of Mjolnir and definitely more Odin-like (you know what I mean), charging into the battle with ginormous crackling electricity surging through his entire form, truly living up to the God of Thunder. Now that's a sight you don't want to miss and by the closing credits, you're already going to catch yourself consistently humming the song that has now become your personal Thor anthem, hah!"
23 April 2021,georgen-11674,2,11,6,Too much comic relief,This film made me feel like it was trying too hard. Nothing like it's predecessors and disappointed with the over use of comical relief at every scene. Just unnecessary tbh.
6 March 2018,adrianaling,1,2,10,"As Thor Would Say - ""I LIKE IT, ANOTHER!""","Thor: Ragnarok is an action packed roller coaster ride that you don't want to end. Taika Waititi (Director) did a fantastic job at bringing humor and action to the third installment of the Thor movies. There was not a boring moment and the action scenes were thrilling. The moment the movie was over, I watched it again! *If Marvel Studios is reading the reviews then I'd like to add that it would be awesome to see Thor and Loki in their own buddy adventure movie where they are fighting villains together instead of fighting each other.*Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth brought so much chemistry and comedy to Ragnarok that you forget that has an apocalyptic ending (No Spoilers). Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster was hilarious. The running joke among fans is that Jeff Goldblum plated Jeff Goldblum in the movie but that's really what was so great about what only he can bring into a scene. Idris Elba showed a more dynamic side to his character, Heimdall. My only complaint was with Tessa Thompson as Valkyie. Thompson had a lot of trouble holding her accent in scenes and couldn't seem to play the character naturally. It seemed very forced and was distracting during some scenes. Cate Blanchett's Hela was interesting to watch but I think the makeup and hair department dropped the ball in a few scenes. Otherwise, all the actors looked great and weren't afraid to show more versatility that they couldn't during the first two Thor movies.The visual effects in the movie were beautiful. Even the score was perfect for every scene. There were two fights scenes in particular that are stunning feats of animation and cinematography. I loved the costume designs in this movie that really highlighted how the characters have grown over the course of the series. Overall, this was a breathtaking movie that has got me very excited for Avengers: Infinity War!"
22 May 2019,yellowfishfilms,2,5,7,One of the better Marvel movies!,"This movie was full of humor, witty lines, and amazing new characters. I loved how it had a storyline more than action, which some people like, and some don't. I think Marvel really did a great job with this one, but I did fall asleep during it. It was just because I was tired, not because it was boring. Definitely rewatching! 😂"
4 November 2017,holloway-sarahjane,0,7,9,Block Buster Entertainment,"The first thing I love about this movie is the humor. Comic book movies should not be so heavy with any meaningful personal lessons that it lacks light moments. At the same time there are subtle lessons about what is morally acceptable and how to get redemption. The sound track was appropriate and exciting and the actors were excellent picks for their roles. The CGI was flawless and did not at the same time seem to be the reason for the film. Other movies like ""Batman"" are depressing but ""Thor"", despite some of the death and destruction, isn't all about how things are simply bad. It doesn't need overt sex to be sexy and it is also a beautiful film."
28 September 2018,devcinco,2,4,9,Cate Blanchett was awesome another great Thor movie,Not the biggest fan of all these superhero movies except when they have good villains. So this is my favorite avenger marvel movie and the dark knight is my favorite superhero movie period because of Heath Ledger as the joker
29 May 2019,panjumon,1,9,9,One of the best movies ever,It's a supercool awesome thriller/ comedy. There's not a single moment of the movie you won't love.
7 May 2019,buxabuxa,3,8,10,Perfect,Very good film! Very funny and cool. 10/10 thor execution perfect.
13 June 2018,brian12994,1,4,10,Takes its queue from GotG and builds on it in an amazing way.,"This movie is great in every way, from the comedy to the action, you'll be laughing some much that you'll miss a great action sequence to then have to watch it again and not mind doing it in the slightest. This money saves the Thor franchise and brought the character from the bottom of most peoples' lists, to the tippy top!"
3 November 2017,zhdcndmr,0,6,8,You think its abit too goofy in the beginning but man does it get good,"Thor Ragnarok wasn't a movie I was excited to see as much as I did with the first Avenger Movie or the First Thor movie but I realized, thats not because the movies getting bad in this series, its just that they managed to keep the bar high since the first Avengers movie in this whole Universe (with some shakes here and there). It starts of abit to goofy for a Thor movie, yes we are used to that from Guardians of the Galaxy but having that from the beginning with Thors accent and the Royal seriousness that we say in the other Thor movies it first feels awkward and out of place but somehow, fastly, it settles in to the story and you start thinking, maybe Thor was even abit too serious until now. The jokes and the humour feels natural and real. The story is not essential for the bigger plot of the movies in this Avenger Universe Series but its still amazing nonetheless. Like I said, Im not a critic but I would give you the advice of watching this in the cinema because of the huge monsters, huge fights, the awesome music and the emotional moments sprinkled here and there."
27 January 2019,nickluzecky,2,4,9,Well Done,Great conclusion to the Thor film series. This one clearly outweighs the first two. The way Chris Hemsworth and director take the character and story of Thor and make it to be what it is in this movie is so wonderful to watch! I am full of joy throughout this entire film. You leave wishing the first two were more like this one. This is the second best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
18 April 2019,blackberryphilskelly,2,8,10,What I love in a movie,"I am a fan of movies that are fun, exciting, and have standout moments.This movie delivers for me on all 3 counts. First of all, the fun/comedy for me worked 99% of the time. I loved the interplay between Hulk and Thor. Add to that the performances of Jeff Goldblum, and Taika Waititi as Korg just added to it. I don't believe that any of the performances let the movie down.When it got down and dirty, it delivered 100% of the time. The action scenes in particular at the end of the movie on Asgaard, were enjoyable and at times almost completely thrilling."
22 October 2018,iamshalaweeks85,1,6,10,What a cool movie!!,Lots of action and comedy which I definitely loved about this film!
13 December 2017,rdnyscott,0,5,10,Thor movie delivers again!,"Ha ha! Marvel is officially my favorite movie studio! Somebody over there just ""gets it""! I've seen claims that there is no deeper meaning in Ragnarok. Fortunately, if you saw deeper meaning in Thor 1, you'll probably see it in this one as well. If you didn't, though, I assure you this movie is still worth seeing because it's definitely hilarious. It's always Easter in the Marvel universe, and I love movies with hidden eggs, which is why I so enjoy Marvel movies, including the Thor movies (each of which I found ingenious). Loki is typically my favorite character, but this time he got some competition from Jeff Goldblum's character, who brings a hilarious cult of personality to this movie. Some say Ragnarok is too humorous, as if any of us aren't guilty of laughing at our own inevitable fate. At least Thor also fights it (since that's what heroes do), but indeed Thor generally accepts his fate with the level of humor required to get the Grandmaster to acknowledge he's a good sport, and though that makes the movie amusing, it's not quite as absurd as some posters might wish to think. Rather, there's a refreshing and entertaining sense of honesty. The writers truly built on the foundations they had previously laid. Watch closely: though he's not in the credits, Matt Damon IS in this movie, and perfectly cast!"
5 November 2017,sefrafer,0,4,7,Thor God of Comedy?,"Thor Ragnarok the best Thor movie? Many of the opinions speak about how clever it was to change the tone of the film and that it gave it originality and this would be true if it had not been for the Guardians of the galaxy since 2014 that it premiered and revolutionized this idea and since then they have come a series of movies with mechanics 80% comedy 20% plot and works as a movie just for fun, but perhaps it is for the only thing that should be ?, the Ragnarok in mythology is the apocalypse Nordic and here they took it as a joke, of course that this is reflected in its director Taika Waititi,Chris Hemsworth as Thor is good work, but he was severely affected by the change of tone his personality is totally different to what wines in previous movies , Tom Hiddleston as Loki I think of the few rescuers in the MCU, nothing bad to say about him, Cate Blanchett as Hela, simply fantastic, his captive role, good scenes of action, good us effects, the music is the only one that begins to tire that put retro music instead of a very good soundtrack? ,, so to conclude Thor Ragnarok is the best of Thor? and the answer is yes, it is entertaining, it fulfills its objective (to make money and space until it arrives avengers) but more important to entertain, it is not memorable, there is not something that tomorrow will remember and say wow that epic was that, only one more than the long list of superhero movies."
16 March 2018,sbsfm-11538,1,5,10,Perfect!,"For starters I loved this movie not just as a Marvel movie but as a movie in general. I've liked all of the Thor movies but I think this has to be the best, the comedy was great the setup for the movie was great and I just enjoyed myself through the whole thing. Definitely if not the one of the best Marvel movers ever."
4 February 2018,pefre-19402,0,4,10,It is a good movie,"This movie was terrific. I enjoyed how adventurous it was. Aside from that I applaud the movie makers for the humour sustained throughout the movie. it kept our eyes glued to the screen. I mean you've got to give them credit. The movie was a mixture of action, adventure and at the same time was funny. It totally kills any boring side.
 I also think we see a different Thor and Hulk now. They are no more the serious drama back then but now we see a fun loving super heroes with new and loving adventures. This movie also teaches us how hard Thor can be a tanker without his hammer. Can't wait for how the Thor group will end up in their current situation as we saw at the end of the movie."

                        ",Thor: Ragnarock is basically the same film as its two previous movies,"An average film at best, Thor: Ragnarock is basically the same film as its two previous installments with a much lighter tone. The ending is predictable and even the cameos (of which there are plenty) don't do much in way of excitement- In fact, after some time they start becoming annoying. What is most unfortunate is that buried deep below the stale narrative lies fantastic lore which could have been utilized. Thor: Ragnarok is an afternoon diversion at best and should be watched with this notion in mind."
20 November 2017,nathaliebazinga,2,8,10,Relatable and easy to watch,"When I first saw the movie plot and the trailer I was very sceptical about it. As a Norse mythology fan I must say I was very disappointed with how they've changed some major details in the story. Anyway, the saving grace here was Taika Waititi and I don't think anybody else could've salvaged this movie but him. It was also great seeing some of the actors from his movies here.I admit it...the movie was great.Not only was the movie surprisingly different from other Marvel's adaptations, but it was also quite easy to watch and very enjoyable and exciting at the same time. I guess people got bored of drama and psychologically draining content. This movie has a refreshing humor to it, not over-the-top, not arrogant, but just right amount of it to make you feel happy and satisfied.Also, let's talk about Thor's haircut...Damn! He finally looks tough. In the previous movies it was pretty visible that his hair was dyed, which was quite a turn-off...This time his looks very natural and with new hairstyle he also becomes a little wiser. This could not have been said for him in the first movie where he was just a reckless, bratty god. We finally see some intelligence in him. He is finally a real superhero...As far as Loki goes, I had a slight feeling they made him look like a petty god, which made me feel a little bit dissatisfied since he was a very powerful character in the previous three movies. Anyway, in the end everything was good. Don't panic. Loki is still the fan favourite!The minor thing I have to mention that I disliked is that they put so much accent on Thor, Hulk and introducing new characters, that some great guys from previous movies got a little neglected unfortunately. As far as the visual side goes, from the photos I assumed the movie would be terrible. However, the setting, the planet Thor ends up on actually looks quite cool despite perhaps being too colorful. I felt as if I'm watching Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. Quite epic, ain't it?Also, Hulk has improved so much, not only visually but as a character as well. He is finally relatable and funny. He finally has a chance to shine the way he should. And who knows, maybe he gets his own movie in the future? I would definitely want to see it if Waititi is behind it.So far, this is probably the best movie of the year for me and I strongly encourage everybody to watch it. Doesn't matter if you're young or old, it is suitable for everyone."
19 November 2019,rawerasad,1,5,8,I loved it,It was a good movie and was something sooo goood and I'm lookin for new movies
17 April 2019,daveggsmith,2,8,9,MCU #17,"Thor: RagnarokGrandmaster: ""And now, I give your Incredible Hulk!l
(we see Hulk burst through stadium wall and roar)
Thor: ""Yes!""
(the crowd suddenly goes quiet)
Thor: ""We know each other! He's a friend from work!""
(Grandmaster looks at Loki suspiciously)
Thor: (to Hulk) ""Where have you been? Everybody thought you were dead. So much has happened since I last saw you. I lost my hammer, like yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh. Loki, Loki's alive. Can you believe it? He's up there.""
(shouting up at Loki)
Thor: ""Loki, look who it is?""MCU present film number 17.
Thor is back in his standalone film for the 3rd time, and I know they've been ups and downs. The first film was great, the second not so much.
So what was the third like?
Exciting, funny, and above all fun throughout. I loved the chemistry on screen as always with Thor and Loki they always deliver top performances.
With Chris Hemsworth, when he was first given the part of Thor he will have done his research on the character, thought of ways he he can play him and to his credit he has done remarkably. Not only did the Dark World help him improve his character but it helped the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole!
Great having Doctor Strange and Hulk appear in Ragnarok as they only helped make it even better.
Lastly, a shout out to Korg - a small part but everytime he was on the screen he stole the spotlight!Korg: (to Thor) ""Hey. Take it easy, man. Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Here. Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see. But don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you."""
18 February 2018,dh-51489,5,12,9,Enjoyable from start to finish,"Let me start by saying that I never read action hero comic books as a kid. It seems that most of the people that had any kind of problem with this film, are those that feel betrayed because this movie strays too far from the comic book version of Thor...I consider myself a pretty good barometer for movies in general and found this to be one of the most satisfying, entertaining and enjoyable cinematic experiences of late. Perhaps the comic book Thor is lot more serious, because the main problem the hardcore fans seem to have with this film is the fact that it's fun. And when I say fun, I mean REALLY FUN! It's full of vibrant landscapes, interesting characters, humour, action, drama, science fiction...There's a tad more fun to be had when you understand the references to other Marvel installments (Thor, Doctor Strange, The Avengers, etc.) but the movie can definitely be enjoyed as a stand alone film. If you're looking for a top-notch popcorn flick that will keep you (and the family) entertained for two hours, you would be hard pressed to find better value for your buck than this..."
4 November 2017,rprice01,1,5,8,A Great Addition To The Marvel Cinematic Universe,"I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnorak. It was filled with great action, humor, plenty of villains, and showed even more interesting corners of the Marvel Universe. It also featured the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first major female villain, Hela, the goddess of death. She is probably going to now be one of my favorite Marvel villains now since she proved to be quite a match for Thor and was captivating to see in her scenes. Another character that I really enjoyed was Valkyrie. She was definitely another strong female character who was a force to be reckoned with for men and females alike. The movie is a great experience in IMAX/RPX/3D. Many of the visuals seemed to come to life on the theater screen. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. It has an orchestral yet futuristic sound to it. I had to listen to it more when I got home. I highly recommend this for Marvel fans. It was quite an entertaining ride. I'm definitely going to have to get it on BluRay too! #ThorRagnorak #Thor"

14 November 2017,ashish065,2,5,8,Thor Re-Defined,"Well generally marvel movies are good. We can expect them to be good. But Thor movies have always been a downside, being the lowest rated of the MCU franchise. Marvel decided to improve on that, and they have been successful. Thor Ragnarock is a fun movie. If you are someone who loves to laugh then you should definitely check this out. The only con for me is the Deviation that they took for the character itself. I enjoyed the Thor who was a bit more serious. Here i Feel like they have made him into a fool.. But still when its all said and done. This is by far the funniest MCU movie ever made which makes it a must watch for any Marvel fan and any cinema goer in general"
7 October 2019,jeffh-70715,3,7,10,The people disliking this movie are just stingy..,"Most people who hate this movie hate it because of the comedy and overall direction. People want to see a superhero film - one that reminds them of the ""good old nostalgia comic book days."" These people are overtly conservative, and frankly I believe they are simply unwilling to accept a new and more interesting direction.As a movie in itself, Thor: Ragnarok is incredible. The writing, acting, score, color, editing, and cinematography are all excellent. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. People disliked the first two Thor movies, as they were cheesy, unnecessarily ""serious,"" and unbelievably boring. So they decided to switch it up. A lot. Make it more modern, make it something that people weren't used to. And they did an amazing job of it. Everything was different. The main baddie was tackled in an unconventional way. The color and cinematography were new and amazing.I imagine the haters of this movie as old-school, traditional, but more importantly, completely limited in their sight of movie capability. They are not people you should be listening to."

In Avengers movie, Thor was this bit of a serious character with some camaraderie with HULK on occasions. I always liked that bit of FUNNY side of Thor in those scenes with Hulk. In Ragnarok, we Thor cracking some really good jokes with some witty lines, right from the start. I would want to believe it as the effect of him being in captivity for some time. But Ragnarok is refreshing and funny with great action and vfx as expected from Marvel movies.Also loved the cameo by three unexpected actors :-)All in all this movie is super fun to watch and we loved watching it on the huge IMAX screen.

20 May 2019,hell_storm2004,3,7,6,Nothing great!,"Felt like making a film just for the sake of it. Other than staring at Cate Blanchett, there was nothing else that I can say that would make the movie more appealing."
23 November 2017,Ishaan_Bhatnagar,0,3,5,Contributor to the Infinity War,"Thor: Ragnarok is a pretty entertaining movie from the beginning. The contest between Hulk and Thor is extravagant and USP of the movie. It is also good to watch multiple characters getting added into the ""Avengers: Infinity War"". All the characters have played decently and have showed a good comic timing throughout the movie. Thor was showed up chained and imprisoned which shows nothing is superlative in any world. Overall, it is a good entertaining movie but not the best from Marvel."
6 March 2018,ajay313,1,4,8,massive improvement on previous Thor films,"I found the first two Thor movies rather earnest and dull; with the exception of Loki, all the characters were quite bland.But this film was a breath of fresh air. I remember laughing in the first few minutes and then being astonished as, at no point, did I stop smiling.The cast were outstanding, particularly Chris Hemsworth. He was very funny in Ghostbusters, but this comedy performance was even better.It helps that only a small part of the movie is on Earth: we get to see various different life forms and a new planet, so Hulk can smash to his heart's content without fear of injuring lots of defenceless humans.Great action too. Highly recommended"
2 November 2017,Obi_Bamm_Karaoke,0,9,9,Top 5 MCU Right Now?,"For the first time in its almost decade of existence, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has released three films in the same year. Starting with ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2"" and continuing with ""Spider- Man: Homecoming,"" 2017 completes the trifecta with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" the third in its series featuring all different directors. This go 'round, we have ""What We Do in the Shadows"" helmer Taika Waititi, who also voices one of the characters in his film.Using Thor's (Chis Hemsworth) vision from ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" where he saw the people of Asgard in severe peril as a jumping point, the God of Thunder finds himself caught up in a race against time itself as he and his brother and God of Mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) try to prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from destroying their home world and everything in it. Along the way, he finds himself on a planet where he is captured by SR-142 (Tessa Thompson) and sold as the slave of the evil Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to take on his champion, gladiator style. That champion just also happens to be The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).Thor is to me one of those characters that is more fan-friendly than marketable to the masses, and the first film of his actually was a pleasant surprise. With great visuals and a better-than-average origin story with big stars helped keep the MCU moving forward as the first ""Avengers"" film approached. It was followed by what can be seen as one of the most forgettable films in the franchise with ""Thor: The Dark World,"" which may have been a bit headier than it needed to be. It seemed to me like the studio made a choice in this installment to take a third direction and work more of a buddy cop/road trip/pseudo- team-of-misfits route, and to me, this is where they found what the series should have been all along.""Thor: Ragnarok"" finds the exact balance of story, action, and humor that a film featuring its characters has to. There are strong themes of family and honor that shine through, battle scenes that are nothing short of brilliant living paintings, and comedy that helps keep all of it grounded all at the same time. Hemsworth really walks the tightrope well after his turn in the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot, which showed his comedic chops, by keeping the God of Thunder light and funny without turning him into caricature. His work with Hiddleston has always been great, and this film takes it to another level with them getting a lot more screen time together. The new characters also fit in perfectly with the veteran characters, filling out the story with Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins being joined by Karl Urban, Blanchett, and even an appearance by Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange (in an extended version of the extra scene during the credits of his film) as well as Ruffalo.At a runtime of two hours and ten minutes, this still runs at a break neck pace that feels like a lot less than that. This is a script that is engaging to the point where the time became almost irrelevant to me, and I am a guy that has a borderline obsession about time. This is truly a good time spent at the theater, and I would go as far as one of the best films in the entire MCU even redeeming the ""Thor"" film that came before it. With the big summer movies not just being limited to the hotter months anymore, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a prime example, and with The House of Ideas' competitor releasing their latest fare two weeks later, they are going to have to bring it in the biggest of ways to dethrone the God of Thunder."
24 June 2022,japma,2,4,3,This movie is not worth my time,"This will go down as the movie that turned The Hulk, an incontrolable beast, to a Le Quirky Green strong guy.The movie ruins characters, which were never all that good to be fair, but now they're even worse.If you're into a film that is in an awkard place between a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously (and isn't all that funny imo) and a blockbuster that is somehow supposed to be taken seriously, then this movie for you."
5 November 2017,singhrohan-89622,0,4,7,Powerful yet light on heart.,"This is the best attempt from marvel comics to make an Thor movie, by the way it's the best Thor movie from miles part compared to other ones. The things that I liked about the movie were the setup and continuity in the story which were missing from the previous movies. This is Chris Hemsworth's best performance since all the performance as the character, Tom Hiddleston was pure gold as Loki and Cate Blanchett ha set a bar for all the actors in the whole franchise and Tessa Thompson should also should be praised as she scored full marks when it comes to technicality of acting. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk was also great as Dr. Bruce Banner. About the story it was good that it was having some fluidity and cinematography was great as it is visual harmony. The director did a good job to make the movie simple and understandable as it could be, because other marvel movies forces you to watch there other presentations. The song preferences for the movie was also good and suits best for all the situations. The imagery was also really nice. The bunch of things that I didn't liked about this movie was Hulk/Bruce Banner as a character wasn't given more screen time or a backstory explanation about the character situation. Tessa Thomson/ Valkyrie was also not suffering from same issues as the Hulk which makes her performance very unrelatable(but the actress did her best to cover it/Full marks there). Overall there should be some backstory provided for all the incident. Many Characters from the previous movies like Idris Elba/Heimdall and Anthony Hopkins/Odin were not utilized properly. This sums up that only draw back about the movie is that there are many characters which were under-utilized and they shine because of there acting prowess. I wanted a explanation about Jeff Goldblum/Grandmaster's character which was not given. BOTTOM LINE: This is really a sound movie technically and emotionally but not a cinematic masterpiece but if you are a marvel junkie or a comic book fan then you'll like this movie."
14 November 2017,prizrakghost,4,10,10,Thor: Reboot,"The total change of the hero and the total change in the atmosphere went very good. We have great hopes for the next Avengers, but after such a Thor, it will be difficult to surprise and fascinate us.The soundtrack is simply beautiful, always at the right time and strongly adds impressions in certain moments.Director Taika Vaititi is just an opening, someone will say that he created in the film a too comic atmosphere. But it was worth it, the jokes are just great. There is no man who does not smile looking Thor: Ragnarok. The humor in the film perfectly dilutes the intense and epic moments. You could add more seriousness or battles, but not the fact that the film would have turned out better.Thor from a little interesting hero thanks to ""Ragnorok"" will definitely fight for leadership in popularity and charisma. He added power, humor, and most importantly in intelligence. He started to plan his actions perfectly and use all the opportunities that are provided to him.In addition to him, the intellect was added by the Hulk, but not so much . He is like bully kid now. Funny and interesting moments with him became even more.The inhabitants of Sakaara are completely different and unusual, far from being patterned, which are very interesting to observe. Asgardians as true wars do not surrender even in the face of death itself and do not kneel before anyone, with a few exceptions.Hella - A great villain. Her motives are perfectly understandable, the power and charisma are simply enormous. She's as pathetic and confident in words as she is on the battlefield. Demonstrating this throughout the film in epic battles. Very rare quality, which makes it one of the most dangerous threats to the universe.And of course Loki! I've never been a fan of this character, but it's hard to argue that he improves every film he participates in. In this picture, he introduces such chaos, humor and interest that he is that zest that makes a great film Masterpiece! To make a masterpiece there must be a star, a puzzle. It is this director for the script and for the cast. Another excellent camera work, editing and soundtrack. Thor: Ragnarok is just that case, all at the highest level.The best film Marvel! Best movie of the year! 10 of 10"

14 June 2018,robinxwonder,2,7,10,One Of The Best Marvel Films To Date,"I believe that this is possibly the best Marvel movie so far, it was the perfect mix of hilarity and dramatic and emotions and family and just everything it is. It's incredibly amazing.I am a huge fan of the entire Thor trilogy, and it's filed with such brilliant character development from Thor (2011), to Thor: The Dark World (2013) and in Thor: Ragnarok (2017).Tails Watiti is the best director for the Thor series, and I hope in any possible future Thor movies, he will direct those as well.He just brought something entirely new and beautiful and colourful to the franchise and did it so wonderfully that every time I watch it I am blown away by how much I love it.It's not a perfect movie, none are, all movies have flaws, but Ragnarok feels too amazing to even focus on them. There is so much more right than wrong in this movie.I loved seeing The Hulk/Bruce Banner making an appearance, he didn't get much development throughout this movie, but the banter shared between Bruce and Thor was amazing and I really hope to see it more in the future.The only thing I did not like about this movie was Hela. She just wasn't interesting enough of a character for me to care about at all, and she just didn't seem at all likeable even in the slightest. I don't blame her for the way she is, I actually blame Odin. But I still don't like her at all.Other than that, the movie was very perfect to me and was completely enjoyable. Also the posters for this movie are incredible."

10 April 2018,sean_j-43236,0,1,6,Thor down,"It's funny, nothing much to it. Really don't get the hype.. did not appreciate how weak they made the Hulk"
29 November 2017,jas-46858,1,4,8,"Good for Superhero movie, bad for a movie movie.","Ill start with the positives, Thor was funny. He had a new character which was unusual at first but later accepted. Like these latest Marvel films, it was quite a funny film, in fact, the film was a lot less serious than earlier marvel and superhero films. The worlds were very creative and that trash place was very well designed. Loki was Loki which was great to see, and the use of Led Zepplin will always be appreciated in my books.BUT, and there is a big but.It misses out on two big things; Story and Tension. Now if you haven't seen the film yet I am putting a Spoiler warning here however I wont go into details. Basically the story is Odin dies and then this girl that's apparently Thor's Sister (doesn't effect the story) and she wants to rule Asgard. But UH OH, SHE KILLS LOADS OF PEOPLE. So Thor tries to stop her with the unbreakable hammer and it breaks. You've seen it in the trailers, it does a titanic. So he gets banished to this trash world and has to fight and escape that world to save Asgard. It's a very simple story that give any messages, it doesn't have any plot twists, and you know exactly how it ends...This leads me to my second point. Tension. We all know how it was going to end. Thor wins. Duh. It's a superhero movie so of course the super hero wins. Now, in a good film like The Dark Knight, we know that Bruce is Human and he can be beaten, so when the Joker begins killing other people it impacts him mentally, and the Dark Knight is often close to dying. Also, the Joker is threatening to kill people WE CARE ABOUT. We care about Harvey Dent, and Rachel, and Gordon. This establishes something called ""Tension."" When you have a literal unkillable god trying to save a bunch of people we don't know or care about, it kind of removes tension, so you end up questioning why we should still care what happens in the film.I do want to move onto a positive note, and here's another spoiler alert. This film has consequences that effect the whole story of the Marvel Universe. I've got to hand it to them, they did that well. A planet actually blows up and Thor loses an eye. I never thought this would happen as in most films where a city or world is in danger the superhero saves it and then the next film they act like nothing has happened. I praise them for that.So to summarise, read the title. It is a good superhero, and it deserves praise. But is it an 8.0+ rated film? No. I would still recommend this film though, it has some funny moments and the visuals are amazing, and if superhero films are your favourite film then this will top your list.Thank you for your time."
12 April 2018,spencieboi,1,4,9,Wow!,"Thor: Ragnarok might be the best Marvel movie! I should probably re watch all the movies to see if this is true, but I really liked this movie! It had great visuals, fun characters, duh, and great humor. I was a fan of Taika Waititi before this movie even came out and I'm so happy he was chosen to direct this because he's hilarious. He plays a character named Korg in the movie and he cracks me up! Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best superhero movies out there, it might be in my top five. It's just a fun movie!"
5 November 2017,woodgatejack-sfr,1,5,8,"Lots of Fun, but needs a little bit more soul.","I found this film highly enjoyable, the best of the three Thor films, a perfect mix of action, spectacle and humour. However, there are events in this film that should have had more of an emotional resonance, but are quickly forgotten to get onto the next gag or set-piece.I think the best analogy would be the Guardians of The Galaxy movies- they managed to make me laugh, wow me and had me sobbing into my popcorn.Once again, this IS a really good film. If is had a little emotional weight to it, it might have been a GREAT film."
29 March 2020,jeffwolkenhauer,1,3,6,Not as good as the first Thor movie,"It had a lot going for it. But it doesn't compare well against the first Thor, which had more emotional growth. This was just pure action. He didn't seem to have much feeling for Asgard's loss. I liked Justice League better."
10 December 2017,NusnakSpilkes,0,2,7,"New Zealanders hijack Hollywood and give them a dose of ""The Kiwi Way""","I hated the previous Thor movies. All flashy, noisy, grandiose nonsense. This Thor movie was definitely very different, almost a comedy. In fact this movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies or any of the Avenger movies. Why?Question: What does Taika Waititi (Director + voice of Korg), Carl Urban (Skurge), and Rachel House (Topaz) have in common? They are all New Zealanders. After the first 20 minutes of this film I was expecting Jemaine Clement and/or for Rhys Darby to show up (alas, 'twas not to be.) But let's not forget New Zealand's blood brothers and sisters from ""over the ditch."" We have Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Cate Blanchett (Hela), both from Australia. ANZAC Spirit is alive and well in this movie! This whole movie runs like a New Zealand-style comedy, reminiscent of Flight of The Conchords TV show or The Hunt For The Wilderpeople movie. Thor Ragnarok is in true Taika Waititi style. Give a Maori ""bro"" some big bucks and some special FX people and you get ""Thor: The New Zealand Experience"" ... aka ""Thor Ragnarok.""Personally I think Waititi stole the show with his rendition of Korg as ""a Maori bouncer from K Road."" (Waititi said in an interview that was the voice he based Korg on.) For those who don't know, K Road is the Red Light District of Auckland City, New Zealand.Even Mark Ruffalo's David Banner character came across (to me) as a typical, matter-of-fact ""she'll be right mate"" New Zealander.Jeff Goldblum was... well, Jeff Goldblum LET LOOSE! Great work Jeff!And Chris Hemsworth looked like he was HAVING TOO MUCH FUN. There are scenes in this movie which are obviously ad libbed and Hemsworth is laughing for real. I would love to see the gag reel from this movie. Happiness and fun permeate this movie. It's pure ""Kiwi humour.""Now to the movie? I haven't read the comics. I watched the movie as a movie. Some of the humour was a bit out of place and the story was OK. The Special FX are fabulous and interesting. A real highlight. A surprising highlight for me was the SOUNDTRACK. What a fabulous soundtrack this movie has. Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" was a great choice for the action scenes. The other incidental music was really awesome too.Here's the real highlight:Hollywood should learn a lesson from this. Stop being LEFT WING SJW's and get back to telling stories that make us FEEL GOOD and SMILE and LAUGH and have a GOOD TIME. Hollywood of America is Dead. Long Live Taiki Waititi. God Bless New Zealand and ""The New Zealand Way."" Making Hollywood great again."

17 November 2017,dietaube,0,4,6,Just slapsticks and no soul,"To be honest, after Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 I realized, that Marvel strips all characters of their identities and makes them quirky funny slap stick monkeys. No time for building an emotional scene anymore, it's far more important to make funny faces and get some laughs. Same goes for Thor - Ragnarok.Time for deep villains with good background story? Nah - ""I am evil, just because."" This concept slowly starts to bore me. Hela has only one purpose: look sexy and change her hairstyle every two minutes because her spiky head piece needs all the recognition. On top of that, you rush through the movie as if there is no tomorrow. One scene jumps to another, funny faces, crotch jokes - next scene. If the final fight wasn't that epic I would give the movie just 6 points.Marvel movies more and more become films for a brain dead audience and this annoys me more than it should."

                        ",Marvel's Best and Hollywood's Redemption,"It would not surprise me if Marvel is unable to outdo Thor Ragnarok.It won't surprise me if Ragnarok goes down as one of Hollywood's most loved Action Fantasy movies right next to Indiana Jones and Star Wars.It won't surprise me if Hela (Ragnarok's villain) is added to AFI's 100 Best Villains list.It won't surprise me if based on this movie, Thor is added to AFI's 100 Best Heroes list.Marvel really may not be able to outdo this one. It's like all the other movies were warm up and this was the game seven moonshot that just can't happen again. It all came together in this one.Over and over I kept blurting out ""wow"" while sitting in the theater. The visuals and action were amazing. And the story epic. As powerful as Thor is, you dive with him in despair, and soar with him in triumph."
30 September 2018,richconnaughton21,3,7,8,A winning formular,"Keeping up with the times and proving themselves to be in a league of their own, the MCU has delivered an action packed sci fi fantasy. The story keeps moving forward with an intelligent script with laughter along the way. The light hearted tone is balanced with some darker scenes and on the nail special effects. The fight choreography is on point and boasts epic moments teamed up with music to excite, energise and thrill the watcher. See what I done there with ""the watcher""?? 
In my opinion this film is right up in the MCU and towers over the previous Thor solo films effortlessly. Marvel and Disney know what the public wants and they keep delivering. Upon watching it for the second time, I noticed more and more little details and jokes that makes you really appreciate the effort and thought put into it. Not necessarily following the comic 100% by any means, much like how there are separate universes within the marvel comics itself, but the cinematic universe is doing it's own thing to a degree and entertaining the masses across the globe."

                        ",Planet Hulk feat. Thor,"I adored the first two Thor movies. They had the right mix of humor and serious plot with well-timed jokes and excellent character development- something this film was severely lacking. Thor seemed to have regressed back to the Thor from the beginning of the first movie, when he was even the focus. Despite being the title character it felt like the main character of the movie was anybody but Thor. Hulk in particular got a lot of focus in the Planet Hulk portion of the movie, which really should have been its own movie rather than taking over Thor. vent though this film was the longest of the three Thor films it was so packed full of unnecessary filler that the parts of the movie that were actually important get glossed over, happening in the blink of an eye to move on to more lengthy filler nonsense. In addition to Thor, Loki was also very poorly written. The god of mischief and lies shouldn't be predictable. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor but even he can't save this movie from its bad writing. It felt like the writers had no idea how to write the characters so they just recycled what they saw in the previous movies.
Worse yet, this whole movie was overrun with bad humor, as though they had tried to shoehorn in as many jokes as humanly possible in the two hour run time. For the ""What was Thor doing during Civil War?"" short the humor worked and made me laugh but for a movie with so much death about the destruction of Asgard and the end of Asgardian civilization as we know it it should be far more serious. All the humor does is downplay the gravity of the situation and the ""comedic timing"" was such that serious situations got turned into jokes and ruined the whole moment. It got to a point where any joke made me cringed or groan in exasperation.
I went to Deadpool to see Deadpool. I didn't go to Thor to see Deadpool, but that's what I got and while Deadpool was great Thor Ragnarok was a complete dumpster fire."

                        ",Fem-autistic BS and PC crap run amok,"It's really sickening the re-writing of cultural myths such as the Norse gods to fit this stupid PC agenda and narrative is unbearably moronic. Hela is, in the actual Norse legends, the goddess of the underworld/hell NOT the goddess of death. Why is there this completely imbecilic idea to just ignore the actual Norse myths and rewrite it to fit some personal identity fem-autistic ideology PC crap when there is an actual character to base it on? In the underworld she is almost unbeatable but outside of it she is a bit on the weak side. That Hela is remade into a fem-autistic character that's is grossly and erroneously overly powered and completely different from the actual legends is just another pathetic and quite annoying act of Hollywood making up a pile of crap so they can pat themselves on the back. She was only strong when she drew her power from the realm of the underworld. This politically correct fem-autistic BS is ruining so much that would have been so good except for the inclusion of the moronic fem-autistic ideology. She breaks Thor's hammer Mjolinir? Really? Geez this is just another fem-autistic crap dance that their PC BS is imposing. Thor's hammer was forged from the core of a neutron star the strongest and hardest substance in the universe which is not possible to break. Odin couldn't have done it and Hela can? Yeah, right. Another thing Hela is NOT Odin's daughter but in fact from the actual myths she's Loki's daughter. Then there's the error of what Ragnarok is. It's not the end of Asgard it's the end of EVERYTHING. Armageddon. The gods and all people, animals, plants ALL life. All planets and stars will be consumed by Fenrir, the monster wolf, after he defeats Odin and kills him. With such a rich story already written why the hell was there a need to substitute with such a load fem-auti$tic PC crap and bullshit that contradicts it in every way. Another thing... Valkyrie is not a name it's the designation for the maiden guardians of Valhalla that rode winged horses who guided the honored dead to it's gates. They're not even Asgardian actually but created beings to perform a task which was protect the gates and entrance as the guardians to Valhalla and guide the honored dead to them."

19 December 2017,dwgmartin-33760,0,4,9,Pure marvel joy,"Thor Ragnarok: the 3rd movie in the Thor series starring Chris Hemsworth as the God of Thunder and this time around directed by Taika Waititi. For the the 3rd instalment Thor faces Cate Blanchett Goddess of Death, Hela. But before he can do battle with her, he must battle his through Jeff Goldblums Contest of Champions featuring Mark Ruffalo's Hulk.This is movie is such a blast, it's easily the best Thor movie out of the three of them; and possibly the funniest of all the MCU- Thor in essence is a rather silly character and Waititi understands he's better suited for comedy over drama. All the actors are hitting their marks, Hemsworth is not overshadowed by Tom Hiddleston unlike in the previous entries (even though Hiddleston as Loki is still smashing it out of the park). Waititi himself plays a new character called Korg (a big blue rock alien) who is just so good, the most timid and kind spoken revolutionary you'll every see. And Jeff Goldblum. Jeff motherfucking Goldblum, am fairly confident in saying that he didn't have a script. That he was just told to be Jeff Goldblum, and boy does he deliver.Ragnarok is an exciting, funny and most of all fun experience bathed in all manner of colours (unlike a certain other franchise). Bringing in Waititi a breath of new air for marvel similar to what James Gunn did with Guardians of the Galaxy, and with this and the super What We Do in the Shadows Taika Waititi is slowly becoming one of my favourite directors at the moment.The only things going against Ragnarok really are a few plot holes which aren't that significant in grand scheme of things; and Cate Blanchett although is great in the role and is clearly having fun with the character, Hela is sidelined for most of the movie meaning her impact on the movie as a whole is less.Overall, Ragnarok is one of the best Marvel movies to date which is saying a lot considering the quality of most Marvel movies, and hopefully Marvel (Disney) will continue to allow directors like Waititi and Gunn to create these werid but extremely enjoyable, fun movies.I give Thor Ragnarok a A."
9 March 2018,dylanb-23290,1,4,8,Best entry in the Marvel movie family yet!,"The goddess of death and Ragnorak have been revived and they must be stopped before Asgard is taken over. This is where Thor and his colleagues come into play.Mainly aspired from recent marvel movies, such as Deadpool, Thor Ragnorak takes a comedic approach whilst executing this film. Several jokes made, in my opinion, would have usually made by Stark himself and not expected by Thor.A story well written and spread within the span of 2 hours.Looking forward for the next on :)"
21 November 2017,triggerhappy-63862,0,5,7,Thor needed this,"I saw Thor: The Dark World recently...I don't remember what happened after 30 minutes in because I got so bored it was unbearable. When I went into this movie, all I wanted was a solo Thor film that does not make me think that superheroes can be boring too. I got exactly that. This is exactly what the franchise needed to pick itself back up. This film is exciting and overall...it is funny. The main thing to know right in the beginning is that this film is a comedy, where the jokes surprisingly land on numerous occasions. However, this film does have trouble finding its balance. That is not to say the film is bad, it is actually quite good (notice how I gave it an 7 out of 10 rating), but this film gets lost in the comedy aspect and barely touches on the dramatic aspect that should be touched on, and it was a little disappointing. However, I had a blast with this movie, I will definitely buy it when it is available to purchase and remember this movie for a long time as one of the most fun experiences I have had in a marvel movie."

12 November 2017,brinksace-1,0,9,9,Very Good,Marvel always has great movies. This one was very good also. Makes you laugh. Not all doom and glum like DC movies. Saw the movie twice and plan on seeing it again. Plus buy the movie on blu ray. Miss not having Jane in the movie. Doctor Strange in the movie could have done without. Maybe an extra scene with Black Widow and the Hulk. But the movie is worth seeing.

3 November 2017,xanderubiria,2,5,6,"If you eat burgers and you eat them everyday, you'll get tired of it","The first act was great, the choreography of the first act, its pace and its direction - all of them were great. They've toyed with the actual origins of Hella, yet it was great seeing Cate in Hella's attire. There were some unanswered questions in the first act, however everything was top notch. Then it all went away.Whatever you saw in the trailers, don't get fooled. The last fight was disappointing, jokes overused (hence the title), there was no battle choreography, but a lovely CGI ****fest. By the end of the movie, I felt like that it would be better if they'd made it 2.5 hours or at least 10-15 minutes longer. And in the last act, I knew every joke beforehand and it couldn't make me laugh anymore.And also, after the first post-credit scene, go - just go... the second one doesn't deserve to be waited for."

9 December 2017,jc-29071,0,4,7,Chris Helm is a great actor,"I want to say that Chris Helm has proved he is a great actor, not just in Thor and the Avengers, but also as the Huntsman in Snow White and the Huntsman, he was really great in that, part 2 was not that great because they tampered with the whole idea of the snow white story, you can't do that and they tried to do an Elsa thing, ""let it snow"" I don't know, it didn't work that I do know. Does it mean Huntsman 3 can't be made? yes it can but it would have to be well scripted and carefully done, attention to detail is key, so perhaps some follow up with Snow White to find out what becomes of her or that he wanders into the story of sleeping beauty to help the prince battle that dragon without tampering too much with the story line, carefully and delicately (remember Malificent in Snow White is a dragon and she could return as the witch here to cause Sleeping beauty curse). Also did anyone see In the Heart of the Sea? The movie was dark and not for everyone but in every scene Chris stole each scene. Also he will reprise his role as George Kirk ( a major part I hope, where he will be there for most of the film) in the upcoming Quentin Star Trek which I hope will not include cursing or sexual scenes and be PG-14 for more violence only. I don't want Quentin to damage the purity of the characters but don't mind the characters an the story getting more intense especially with the Romulans, the Borgs, the whole story line as to why all the aliens are human-like needs to be answered! I also look forward to the return of Picard in this film and don't you dare kill him like they did Han-solo in Star Wars and they better not kill Luke SKywalker or there are going to be protest! Finally I hope he will get to be in other sci-fi films like ALiens or or the next Terminator or even the next Avatar. I would also love to see him in Part 3 of Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. this next movie should return to the Genius Sherlock we saw in part one and really make these three (with Jude Law and Chris) really go all the way for the final film, while being faithful to the novels."

4 November 2017,surferx-59853,2,5,6,Good movie - had high expectations (may contain spoilers),"Well, went in to see this movie with high expectations amidst all the hype. Was not disappointed except the the actors delivering the one- liners and humour (quite a lot) looked as if they were trying too hard. Some somewhat predictable. The SFX, well it was okay although some looked very very obvious that they were green/blue screen. What happened? Too obvious to miss (Odin family sea/ocean scene) and a few others. Quite distracting. Still had to get used to a very verbally- active Hulk.Overall though, the plot line and movie was an eclectic mix of good humour and acting all-round. Looking forward to the next great instalment in the MCU."

We have watched it 3 times so far and enjoy it more each time. There are some really funny lines in this movie. The opening scene where Thor makes the demon wait while he spins back around is pure comedy genius worthy of something the Monty Python men would have written. I can't say enough great things. Please watch or purchase as soon as possible. Pure movie magic. More Thor movies please..!!"
23 March 2018,brent_lacey90,0,3,10,Very nice change of pace,"This was an awesome movie, the humour really done it for me it was a nice change of pace to the more serious films in the MCU. I did get a very Guardians Of The Galaxy type vibe about it but overall it was great. I'm a massive fan of the MCU I don't think people realise how huge this whole thing has been so it's been a helluva ride and it's only getting better with this film."
3 November 2017,nmik2005,1,5,8,A full blown comedy.,"This movie was super fun to watch. This is definitely the best among all the Thor movies. Thor, to me has always been so damn boring and least interesting of all super heroes. Even in the first 2 Thor movies, Thor was okay'ish. But in Ragnarok, he is definitely one of the best. Thor Ragnarok is one of those movies, that you could watch a lot of times primarily because it's a full blown comedy. What the movie lacked was a sense of stakes, you never felt like any characters were in trouble at any point in time during the movie. Some of the action sequences were amazing, and some felt a bit incomplete or underwhelming(primarily the ones involving Hela). This movie lacked the emotional panache that you'd expect from this sort of movie, and that's primarily what Marvel has been focusing on in their last couple of movies. They're basically using a formula that works and increasing it manifold. It's getting a bit repetitive but apparently this works for most of the audience. Marvel's policy now is apparently to stick to a formula that works rather than try something different & fail. I just hope that DC doesn't try to emulate this Phase 3 version of Marvel movies.No matter what criticism I might have against this movie, it's still a damn fun movie."
5 November 2017,neilshemeld,2,10,8,Lovely stuff,"Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy film of what superhero films should look like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky perro; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a strange movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single movie and having every single washer and wing-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok."
11 November 2017,joshualawrencepike,0,7,8,"While I would not say it's the best Marvel movie, I would say it's the most fun and the most funny.","Ragnarok was very different from the other two Thor movies. It is much more of a comedy, the tone is half guardians of the galaxy and half Flash Gordon. However it does not fall into the trap of hurting its own plot for the sake of laughs, the threats feel real. The thing that struck me is how much it shows the short comings of Thor. He really is not someone who should be on his own, while a good man he is still arrogant and overconfident, and does not think as deeply or as often as he should. That is one way in which he and Loki make a good team, between the two of them they make one functional person. Speaking of Loki, as always any scene with both of them is worth its weight in gold.While I would not say it's the best Marvel movie, I would say it's the most fun and the most funny."

The directing by Taika Waititi is phenomenal and I love how he encouraged the cast to explore improvisation because in my opinion it really paid off. My favorite part of this film is the creative decision to totally rebrand and rework Thor's character into more of a funny, light-hearted version of himself that makes fun of his own ego. The franchise definitely needed it! 11/10 stars!"
21 November 2017,lowgunberry13,0,6,8,mix of 80's retro nostalgia/ Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy,"THOR: RAGNAROK (LOGAN AT THE MOVIES) REVIEW B+This 3rd Thor solo movie starts great, with some pleasant surprises in the opening half hour, including some clever cameos. Thor is railroaded by Surtur (a huge fiery demon) who warns him of Ragnarok (Armageddon for Askgard). Thor is reunited with Loki and then shortly meets with Doctor Strange who gives Loki a taste of his own medicine. The force behind Ragnarok is Hela, Thor's older sister and rightful heir to the throne. Cate Blanchett's has become accustomed to villainous roles and once again she proves she can do evil and devious. Boy is she a force to be reckoned with.Idris Elba returns as Heimdall but for reasons unknown is absent his post, while Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") joins the Marvel world as Valkyrie. But the main selling point here is Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk is also back in the game. As crazy as it sounds, the Banner/Hulk character brings a much-needed sense of reality to things. In a way this is Marvel's attempt to incorporate the planet Hulk story-line.Director Taika Waititi does instill some much-needed energy into the ""Thor"" series with some fresh locations and inventive creatures. Compared to the first two films this has a much different feel. This is quite a mix of 80's retro nostalgia, with a ""Star Wars"" feel when it comes to action and a lot of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" vibe in respect to comedy and soundtrack. Jeff Goldblum rounds out the cast as the Grandmaster kind of a Batiatus (""Spartacus"") and Herod (""The Passion of the Christ"") type of character.What doesn't work is the 3D format while the depth is clearly visible and done well the in your face aspect is nearly non- existent.PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and brief suggestive material The action is fairly light here, but the main issue is with the sexual material, in terms of several racy references that are border lined R rated, to nearly seeing Hulk's rump and junk."
2 August 2018,zetatotania,1,4,8,Best movie of the franchise!,"Great fun, great rythme, watched it twice.

6 October 2018,triggermedat,3,7,9,"Cheesy, but good cheesy","I loved this movie. It was so exhilarating, so fun, and it embraced the cheesiness. Comic books are cheesy, and this movie embraced it. It also got rid of the stupid humans. The last Thor movies were held down by the normal boring people like marvel thought we needed someone to relate to since the regular moviegoer isn't a god of thunder. But now, after Guardians opened up the floodgates of weirdness, allowing the Marvel movies to get weird, we don't need relatable humans. Which is why this movie just works.When I think God of thunder on a remote golden planet with rainbow portals and sci-fi fantasy weapons, I don't want a romantic comedy. This movie moved away from that and became a sci-fi rainbow disco rave filled delight.9/10 too much water."

10 November 2017,fuzzymax-76787,0,6,9,"Thor Ragnarok is a ridiculously funny, entertaining spectacle and valued entry into the MCU.","Thor Ragnarok is a comedy disguised as a superhero film, in the same way that the Guardians of the Galaxy films are superhero films disguised as sci-fi comedies. This worried me going into the film; would this movie be too light to stand alongside other entries in the MCU? Overall however, Ragnarok was brilliant, thanks in no small part to the visually stunning direction, engaging cast and irreverent humour. Taika Waititi has enormous fun directing, and steals scenes as the hilarious Korg, with his offbeat humour and comedic style being key elements of the film which consistently had me laughing throughout. Chris Hemsworth is on fine form, and the new and unique take on a Thor film allows Hemsworth to create a far more likable God of Thunder. Alongside Thor, Tom Hiddlestone turns out another stellar performance as Loki, Mark Ruffalo excellently handles both personas of the Hulk, and Tessa Thompson portrays new character Valkyrie, who is very impressive in the film. Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster is a highlight of proceedings; let if not be said that nobody does a better Jeff Goldblum. If there is a weak link in the cast, then it's Cate Blanchett's Hela, who I personally didn't find compelling as an antagonist. In concerns to plot, Ragnarok isn't story heavy, however this allows a platform for more gags, which is what the film really nails, so thin plot isn't a major issue. I do however feel that Ragnarok could have done with more emotional scenes; because of the relentless humour and action sequences, Ragnarok lacks the same heart as Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 for example. The spectacle in this film is immense, and the special effects solid; these components combined with Waititi's unique deadpan quirkiness add to what is a genuinely entertaining spectacle well worth a cinema visit to see."
24 February 2018,jbiederman-34723,2,4,5,Thor Really Wants To Be Peter Quill,"If you wanted to see Thor turn into Peter Quill and great actors thrown out the window for cheesiness, look no further because Thor: Ragnarok is your movie. The creators of this full-on slap in the face to the fans even admit it in the bonus content! They admit they thought Thor and Hulk would be great characters for a buddy movie but boy were they WRONG. I'm guessing their collective heads are up the same you-know-where and they're being blinded by how well the Marvel franchise has done so, now they have no concept of what works for what characters. Time to take a step back guys and really look at this movie for what it is, one of the three stooges with super human strength and nice abs goofs around with one of the Avengers. The actors, as always, do superb jobs but there is no story, no real plot, no suspense - just Guardians of the Galaxy goofiness."

5 November 2017,jordanrossreviews,1,4,7,"""A hilariously fun ride, that isn't anything deeper.""","JordanRossReviews: Thor: Ragnarok– 7/10 Rating: PG-13 <> How to Watch: Theaters I greatly enjoy the Marvel movies because of their balance. I've often admired how Marvel Studios has been able to take the seriousness of these fantasy stories and fuse them with the comedy of its characters and situations to find a perfect middle. Some are more serious than others and some more comedic, and you will find fans on either side of the spectrum. Thor: Ragnarok was not balanced. If you're looking for a fun ride than look no further, but if what you're after is an intriguing storyline, serious acting, or even some great battles then look elsewhere.Speaking of acting, I loved Cate Blanchett as Hela, but the threat of her character and overwhelming power never seemed serious. Obviously you can guess that the heroes will most likely win at the end of the day, but when you make it so blatant it really steals away the threat. When it came to the action I was let down as well. There were the start of some very good scenes, but none of them could stay serious for longer than thirty seconds, if they even managed that long without a one-liner or pokes at superhero tropes. The scenes where we did see the darker and grim side of events felt rushed and after thoughts, almost as if the director had to put them in, but only to get back to the humor. Once I found out Taika Waititi was the director, whose previous work includes What We Do in the Shadows it made a little more sense. It truly felt like one big joke, but if you like your comedy you'll probably like this movie. If you're a hardcore nerd who seriously debates who would win in a fight between Thor and Hulk, don't get too excited. This film felt like a side story within the Marvel universe and one I hope that was meant to be the comic relief in the long line of more serious titles. A great comparison to make within the Marvel family would be that Thor: Ragnarok was the complete opposite of Logan. This film had jokes from the first line to the last. The serious fantasy and science-fiction fanboy part of me wanted to attack this movie, but even I can enjoy a pure laugh fest from time to time, as long as this doesn't become the norm.

30 March 2018,lauralflf,2,4,2,Completely missed the point,"I had no idea the main characters from an original movie could be so ""out of character"". This was nowhere near the first two Thor movies - not in acting, screenplay, emotional depth, etc.
The movie seemed more like a succession of bad jokes (between some good ones) than an actual story. It wanted to be funny all the time, even at the most inappropriate of times (which was sorely annoying), and gave away most chances of evoking deeper emotions. The two stars give credit to all the special effects - sadly I was disappointed by almost everything else.Maybe it's just my disappointment that's making me see this movie in such a negative light, but Thor I & II set the bar pretty high for me. So I can't understand how it got such a good rating and so many 10 point reviews..."

22 January 2018,basoirbans,1,6,10,Different but enjoyable to an open mind,"This Thor movie is unlike the others. The other Thor movies were serious and I liked them a lot. When I saw the trailer of Thor Ragnarok, it hurt to see that they made it into something humorous. And I held my heart in fear.
Boy did I get pleasantly surprised. Somehow it was a blessing that they have created a light and airy atmosphere to tell the story. Keeps Thor fresh and interesting.
I ended the movie with a good feeling and a yearning for more which is why I'm writing this review.
If you're open minded and you like the Thor universe, you won't be disappointed. If you're conservative, then don't bother.
From me, an honest 10/10 
Real top entertainment!"

                        ",Recommended!,"Though I am not the biggest fan of superhero movies, I definitely had a good time with this one, great characters and character development and a solid plot, which is not too predictable."
17 November 2017,musardhianto,1,5,6,"Deadpool movie in Superman concept, what can i say?","From Action, Adventure, Fantasy to Action, Adventure, Sci-fi and finally to this.....COMEDY!! I bet marvel already got a superhero movie parody which is Deadpool is great. But this!?? Thor used to be Arrogant, Strong, and Grounded character. To become parody in his own movie, is a joke itself. Well, first thing i imagined when i read ""Ragnarok"" is war and destruction. this is Light comedy movie. If this supposed to be Superhero movie, its a letdown. If this was intentionally to be comedy movie, it nails! I think its a waste for Hela as outstanding menacing villain, and Loki's character (used to be). Valkrie did the good job also, but Thor didn't. In the end, i asked myself, ""What is superhero movie should be?"". Entertaining, so people can laugh and forget, or Inspiring, so people gasped while watching then proud and thrilled to become better person after it."
6 March 2018,kumarguptamaurya,0,2,6,Character arc goes to dustbin,"I know fanboys are tough to argue with but what has happened to the critics.This movie takes the previous two movies,throws then out of the room without any justifications.In the first two movies,Thor is a serious guy with sometimes ego problems but in this he simply behaves like a child.Every frame is filled with humour which is good the humour is brilliant but when you just kinda revamp the character without any explanation,the movie sucks.at least show us how he changed from Odin son to a 11 year old child.The VFX was good.it justifies its 200 million budget.I am seeing a problem with the critics while judging a marvel movie,they term each movie to be the best.This movie has 90% ratings on rotten tomatoes,are u kidding me.It is in the same league of the likes of The dark Knight and Logan which is ridiculous.Its a disrespect to those movies.If the critics are afraid of Marvel fanboys,don't be.But please think before rating any movie as the best the studio has to offer.The sudden change in character is also seen in justice league with Batman and everybody on the internet bashed it.Please don't rate Marvel movies,in a dishonest manner,in a flattering way."
30 March 2019,februaryisabella,2,5,8,One question,"This is a wonderful movie but does anyone know what happens to James, Thor girlfriend. I don't see her in this movie anymore."
4 November 2017,Falcon67,0,9,10,"Very good similar to ""Planet Hulk""","This movie was very good, my son and I enjoyed it very much. The scene with Stan Lee in it was probably the funniest one he's been in that I can think of. In fact this movie has lots of humor in it. This movie has many parts and characters in it similar to the 2010 movie ""Planet Hulk"" in which Hulk is also used as a Gladiator. Also not too soon into the credits is a small clip instead of being near the end like some movies do. I recommend anyone watching this movie also watch the 2010 ""Planet Hulk"" as well."
23 November 2017,bluewonder-54189,3,8,10,Pleasantly surprised,"I loved this movie! I was worried that it'd be too comedic for me but it was done so well, it was great! There were some wonderful surprises in this movie that really pleased me. Most of the time we get the best parts of a movie in the advertisements we see on TV or in other media outlets, but not so in this case. Thor: Ragnarok was full of surprises. I will say it's my favorite of the 3 Thor movies to date. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection when it is released. Can't wait to watch it again. Nicely done, Marvel and Disney!"
23 December 2017,pfehrman-1,0,5,10,Sooooo much better than I had expected,"This one had so many funny moments to it I think I may just have enjoyed it more than the previous Thor related movies. That is unusual, they usually go downhill from the original movie, but not this one. I loved the humor that was infused into this movie; it made it stand out. And let me tell you, I think I needed that with the plethora of bad movies being made and offered to the unsuspecting masses lately. This one was fresh and fun. I wouldn't mind seeing it again to be honest...maybe I will ! :D"

                        ",Best fighting scenes,"Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date."
2 November 2017,Otakore,0,6,8,A comedy Thor film you wouldn't disagree,"Waititi and the team are game-changer. They made this film more entertaining with humorous lines. With more than two hours of film length, you wouldn't feel tiredness because of the said funny scenes. Fans who haven't watched it yet might find my review about Thor being a comedy, a cardinal sin. No. The comedy lines are just right and fitting even though it kind of overrides the meaning of Ragnarok.This is the best Thor movie so far than its prequels. I highly recommend it. Thanks!"
28 February 2018,bloglogician,0,2,8,Must see for the newzealand rockman bro,"Quite a few funny moments. Make sure you don't go in expecting too much, however. Jeff Goldblum as ""Mojo"" from the xmen was well done. Blue rock man with newzealander accent is absolutely hilarious."
13 November 2017,ddawgsutes,2,6,9,FUNNNNY Great show,Along the lines of Guardians and Deadpool in terms of comedy in an action movie. Also very close to Avengers and the Captain America films. Just good all around shows. Marvel has done it yet again. I really wouldn't have thought of Thor as a comedy but they realized how popular the comedy in these action movies can be. Stay til the end for a couple small tidbits after the credits too.
9 May 2018,jude_rc,1,2,9,One of the best (if not THE best) MCU film,"I dip in and out of the Marvel Universe as it all seems to get a bit 'samey'. However, a good film is a good film, and Thor Ragnarok is a fantastic film! I will say that this is not only my favourite Marvel film, but one of my favourite films ever! Yes, of course it helps if you've seen other Marvel films , but I feel this works really well as a stand alone film. The dialogue is great, with a lot of funny one liners and I liked Thor and Bruce Banner teaming up, they worked well together. Wasn't a massive fan of the evil sister (Cate Blanchet) , but that's just me. The rest of the film more than made up for it.Overall, you don't have to be a Marvel fan to enjoy this film. If you're just looking for something funny to watch, that has good dialogue, a great jaw line and a lightning induced fight scene, this is your film. Well worth a watch! Oh, and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant."
28 May 2019,tempsjayjay,1,7,9,Marvel does Comedy,"Got to be the funnest of all the MCU films to date, no easy thing either, really enjoyed this."
9 November 2017,amberlitteken,0,9,10,Amazing!,"What are you doing reading this review? Go see the movie! It's fantastic!!! I was laughing as soon as the movie started, after the credits (seriously don't miss the end scene!), and even now thinking about it. This is now my favorite Thor movie AND Marvel movie. There was not one stale moment during this film unlike other Marvel movies. Highly recommend."
17 February 2018,thefuturists,7,25,8,REFRESHING,Wait a minute. So you can make a successful superhero movie without a gratuitous romantic interest side story?? And you can include engaging female characters even without said side story? And still appeal to a broad audience? HOW REFRESHING!!!
29 March 2018,jdoe3156,0,2,8,Lots of misses but also a few big hits,"I was very surprised by the cheesy, over-the-top cringe-worthy attempts at ""jokes"" in the beginning of the movie. Every 20 seconds there's a super lame ""joke"" that's not even remotely funny. But once you realize that this show is a ""comedy"" unlike the other Thor movies, which are a bit more serious and inject comedy into more suitable moments, it becomes a bit more bearable.Towards the mid-end of the movie there's actually some REALLY funny moments. I would rate the beginning 3/10, then the mid 5/10 and the end 8/10 (it was funny, however the final fight was kind of anti-climatic.).
Because the outro song is _very good_ I had to eventually rate the whole movie at 8/10 ;)"
28 March 2018,tchui-69397,0,2,10,I laughed through the entire movie,"This was by far the funniest and most epic of the Marvel movies. It has the coolest shot EVER in the entire comic installment movies. It's a typical large scale, clean, Hollywood super hero movie, but it has some down to earth roots too. It's about a guy that wants to save his home and he has this unreliable brother and volatile drunk girl to rely on for help. It's great."
28 March 2018,trujillof58,1,3,4,Entertaining despite the Disney Undertones,"I watched this movie after seeing Black Panther and I laughed at lot. The plot was meh and predictable and again another movie with that terrible Disney aftertaste. It does have more funny moments than it's predecessors but I really couldn't stomach the VAST and OVERDONE notion of making Asgard VERY DIVERSE almost to the point of nausea. Having grown up reading these comic books, I must say that I'm really sick of seeing through the political correctness ploy that's used by Disney."
22 January 2018,paulbartley,0,5,9,Brilliant Movie - a little too much humour but it works,"This movie went above my expectations, the colour use, soundtrack and even cinematography where excellent, character build up spot on and Director Taika Waititi just proves why he's such an amazing Director (Boy) - (What We Do In The Shadows) are a must watch to further admire his directorial capabilities - I just hope he gets more big budget movies to do."
16 May 2020,lsguk,2,8,6,Why though?,"Why is it trying to be a comedy? Why was the majority of the film entirely pointless jaunt around a random alien planet?The comedy is jarring in comparison to the other Thor entries.Like Star Wars: The Last Jedi it does little to advance the actual story for the most of it, with the story progression accounting for about 45 minutes."
4 November 2017,godinevin,0,5,8,A quick read before you run to cinemas.,"As Marvel cinematic universe continues to create a visual treat with the right amount of humor served to its audience. At least the trend is catching up after the GOTG (Guardians of the galaxy) series. With regards to the previous Thor movies, Ragnarok didn't stretch itself a bit. One would be surprised that they were glued to their seats for almost 2 hours. Being strictly sticking with the comic book, the story line wasn't stretched out rather more elements of pun and sarcasm makes the movie super fun. Hence most of the movie revolves in and around the galaxy the 3D and VFX artists have created a visual scenario where it's highly recommended that you use your glasses (3D).With the special appearance of our beloved characters Dr. Strange and The Hulk and Loki, the movie is full of great screen appearances. Hence with a lot of cast around Chris Hemsworth gets attention the moments he needed the most and the actor has developed a new sense of humor and method acting compared to previous Thor roles. And of course, the Cameo of Stan Lee is allegorical in the movie. P.S you don't have to wait until the Post credit scene, there's nothing Big."

5 November 2017,svnair-13226,1,9,9,The best Thor movie ever,"By the far the best flick from Marvel which has all the action, drama and spot on comedy. There was not a single instance where audience did not laugh or applaud. Ever scene kept delivering the awesome timing of dialogues that had a pinch of humor to it. The bonding between Thor and Hulk was hilarious. The power of Thor finally revealed with super villains as bad as ever. Overall the movie kick-offs with humor till the very end apart of stunts and action sequences. Thumbs up to the franchise..Keep it going !!"

This is Literally the case.. ;)So, what's good in this movie.? Hmmm.. Lemme think.. Humor for instance. It has THE BEST HUMOR in MCU TILL DATE. (Because God of Thunder is doing it ;) ) Thor has done Least humor.. Till Now.. He is now leveling with Starky.. God of Humor :DAbout story, It's really good this time, guys. Thor: the Dark World was more Darker in these trio but Ragnarok is even Lighter than the first one. You'll Definitely enjoy it more than previous Duo (you know what I did there ;) )""Eric Pearson"" Remember this name. This guy has done an Excellent job in Screenplay. Hats off, Man..From Story to Screenplay to Cinematography to Dialogues to Special Effects to Direction, This Is Extra Ordinary.. Taika Waititi, New name in talented director's list..~ Hemsworth, really did a Fantastic job (Though somebody cut his Hair :D )~ Hiddleston, When did somebody ever Hate this guy.? Never man, Never.. You're the Best.. :D~ Cate Blanchett, Ooohhhh.. Best Vamp Marvel ever had or has now.. :*~ Jeff Goldblum, Hahahaha.. you'll do the same in theater.. :D~ Ruffalo, Man... The Best HULK you've Ever Seen.. He can Talk.. :D~ Sir Hopkins, Karl Urban, Tessa Thompson, Idris Elba (Ma man :D ) All did decent job to their role..At the end, my Rating for Thor: Ragnarok is.. *drumrolls*.. Awesometecular.. Yeah it's borrowed word.. Anyway, enjoy the flick..Peace \/"
22 March 2018,Curlygirly1,0,2,10,First Marvel movie for me.,"This was a very entertaining, fun, exhilarating movie. It made perfect sense to me, from start to finish, which is a feat because it's the first Marvel movie I've ever seen. I'd watch it again."
23 November 2017,lynkdata1,0,3,7,Always Funny and Disturbing,"I laughed a lot at the chair ride in to see the Grandmaster (who, by the way, was one of the scariest things about this film, LOL). I enjoyed the movie very much but didn't understand a number of things: If Loki can change his appearance, why do the ""get help?"" Other than it was funny? Why not just change into the grandmaster? Also, the sister is ""tied"" to the planet but no other Asgardian is? Loose thread. One star off since we haven't seen Jane and the flimsy excuse was flimsy over why."
18 April 2020,tom-ridel,2,11,2,Ragnasuck,"It's a nice little kiddie (ages 3 to 5) comedy. Nothing too special, and not really for teens or adults. Typical Disney. Trying to make a joke out of everything and sell Chinese merch at its own stores and at Wal-Mart."

And some just raise the bar because they deliver on all fronts. Well Thor Ragnarok is one of those rare beats that deliver on all fronts.
A must, even if you don't like the Super hero films, this is just so entertaining."
30 June 2019,KensaoLightbringer,1,9,8,Great movie!,"Thor Ragnarok is probably the best of the three films in the trilogy! There was a definite change of direction, more in the spirit of ""guardians of the galaxy"": a lot of comedy and jokes that mix well with a lot of action and fighting. Great movie!"
17 March 2018,sammicurr80,1,4,10,One of the Best Marvel Outings,"To date, Thor: Ragnarok was one of the better Marvel movies in my opinion.I'm not sure what it is, but 'superhero movies' just don't seem to hold the magic of old. They either spend too much time with origins or have hardly any hero screen time.Thor is well established now so no pointless back story to worry about. From start to finish, I enjoyed every minute. There was humor, popcorn inducing action and 'wow' special effects.What has been created her is something far more enjoyable than the Avengers movies. This is one I could watch over and over."
16 August 2018,types007,1,8,10,They keep making it better and better,"I thought the first movie was good and gave it a 7, the second one was okay as well a 7. This one is a 10. Jeff Goldblum was a great addition. Good balance and pace, amazing how they can still make a PG-13 movie great."
12 November 2017,bakidarakari,0,6,8,Thor the God of Thunder,As usual Thor is fighting for his Homeland but this time with his own family which he had learned recently.in the first half I thought it's a mix of Mummy n Gladiator.Movie will catch your attention once Hulk/Banner make their appearances.visual effects are good and watching in 3D is really enjoyable.ovearll it has done a good job.

15 December 2017,IAmTheZump,0,3,7,Yet Another (Oddly Charming) Marvel Setpiece,"Look, I was ready to hate this film. I guess ""hate"" is a strong word, but I was at least ready to feel the sense of fatigue that I've been getting lately from superhero films like Captain America: Civil War and Doctor Strange. And I will admit that there was plenty of the usual CGI explosions and anime-style power-ups that became an arms race to see who could have the most lightning-fuelled spirit visions, or whatever. But what the hell, I enjoyed this film. I loved the dialogue, even the usually cringe-inducing nudge-to-the-viewer quips that pepper a lot of major franchise films these days. I loved Thor, I loved Loki, I loved Jeff Goldblum (despite the fact I can't for the life of me remember his character's name). It's yet another Marvel film, but, damn it, it has charm."

6 May 2019,abhreebhu-397-558439,0,3,6,"Been there,,seen that","Let me start by mentioning that i am a huge fan of the avenger series,,the 1st two movies were quite fun,as were single titles like Iron Man,Thor,Captain America,Ant-man,,,,but over the years marvel has done nothing different,,,i mean Guardians are one for sure,n i loved both of these movies,but the parameter as a whole has been brought down by same things going in circle,,,haven't watched Infinity War and Endgames yet(nor panther/spiderman) but i seriously hope they live up to the hype!!!PLOT and STORY
The premise is decent,the opening scenes are quite interesting actually,but then it all becomes so predictable,,,,the most powerful God's running from threat,the threat is shown to be invincible,the hero loses and reaches some safe haven,,rests,strengthens,accumulate his team,returns to fight the evil,,and wins,,,,Marvel has been so predictable since half a decade and they fail to acknowledge that.CHARACTERS and ACTING
Some new interesting ones,,like Hela(Cate Blanchett) and Grandmaster(JEff Goldblum),,some same old propaganda ones like Valkyrie(Tessa Thompson) and Executioner(Karl Urban),,,acting's pretty good for a super-hero flick,,could have been a better without cheesy dialogues.DIRECTION and SCREENPLAY
The best thing,and probably the one that kept me sitting,,,the fights were pretty decently depicted and the environments and worlds were beautiful.Overall it's an entertaining movie but for a sequel for an amazing franchise,it is not at par,,,i mean when i know what is going to happen the next minute,how can u keep me interested???"
2 November 2017,zinjo00-587-975183,0,8,9,Best Thor Movie thus far!,"I loved the energy, the tongue in cheek jokes, the vintage comic book color palette, the music, I could go on an on. It took the whimsy of the character interactions initiated by Jon Favreau in Iron Man and Joss Whedon in the Avengers films and ran with it. The casting is spot on and the story never slows enough to remind you of your theater seat. Well worth the money to see this film on the big screen. You will feel like you finally got your money's worth at a Thor movie."
24 January 2018,jarleatjelland,0,4,9,Great fun if you like movies like Guardians of the Galaxy,"Seems like most of the bad reviews are from comic fans that hate the movie for not being what they expect. If your are NOT a die hard comic fan that takes it personal when movies are not true to lore but likes: + sci/fi
+ loads of humor
+ great and sometimes over the top action
+ colorful and creative artistic styleIn short this movie is simply great entertainment, but its not deep or meaningful. 
4k Blu Ray material!"
24 April 2018,tonyvg-98399,1,3,8,"More than anything, simply enjoyable","In ""Thor: Ragnarok"" director Taika Waitit serves up yet another incredibly enjoyable film, taking an all but dead franchise and revamping it for the general public's enjoyment. Trimming all the dead weight of the Thor mythos, Waititi knew what needed to be done to save this series. However, at the end of the day, the story is still about fighting a generic villain with bland motivation. Even with a boring villain at the center of the story, there are so many obscure and hilarious characters(Korg) and events(everything on Sakar) to make the movie a must see. Another bonus is that they are finally bumping the color over at marvel studios, so the movie looks simply beautiful. This movie is definitely worth a watch."
24 January 2018,Sullccc,1,6,9,Easly the best Marvel movie thus far,"Only thing i can recommend is that you watch this movie in a theater...Don't listen to the haters, empty your head and go watch it.You will have a great time."
13 March 2018,minge-79873,0,1,7,The Hammer just misses the nail,"Whilst a great all round Marvel movie, Thor just didn't feel quite right for me. As a long time fan of Marvel - not just the movies - this Thor was the furthest from the character they could have gotten. 
In the previous movies Chris Hemsworth stays true to the character and portrays the serious Demi-God with just enough humility to make you believe in Gods. Then I'm Ragnarok he's now a comedian? This is just such a sharp change to the character that it almost doesn't feel canon - whilst Hemsworth is again superb his two performances of Thor are so different from his last appearance in AoU. Hulk's side story feels almost unfinished but we've been told if his longer arc that is yet to conclude. 
That aside, the action, set pieces and final chas yet development are great and worthy of another marvel hit."
19 January 2018,niindyaineaz,0,3,7,Enjoyful,"Thor: Ragnarok is different marvel's movie. Before this movie release, I don't think will see Thor with new hair, and finally, he has that. Valkyrie is so amazing character, Taika as a director makes this movie incredibly fun."

19 January 2022,stepanchertihin,1,2,10,super movie marvel!,"I perceive this movie more as a magnificent, colorful and large-scale fairy tale, or rather, as a screen version of myths. I was hoping for ""Thor 3"", although I don't really like the previous two parts, especially the second part...
And again, on the stage, the brave, courageous and sensible Thor, as well as his cunning and treacherous, charming and inimitable brother Loki, who, unwittingly, ""woke up"" Ragnarok
Myths and legends about the Gods of various nations are now in favor with my daughter. The premiere of the film ""Thor 3: Ragnarok"" is scheduled for November 2, 2017 in Russia, but in the world the film was released on October 24 and this part was already on the Internet at that moment (the picture quality is quite good, but there was a two-voiced translation). Fortunately, I am writing from the revised one, otherwise everything would be completely forgotten."
3 February 2018,sloveniandragon,0,5,7,A fine fantasy movie,"I wish i could have evaluated this movie with 10 because it is a really remarkable movie. Special effects,the CGI are all at their best they make the movie seem realistic. Thor also is at his best ,his action scenes ,special powers are at 10. The movie plot is well organized,you will find the story very attractive and challenging. Karl Urban character is my favorite here, Kate Blanchet also plays well the character of an ambitious conqueror , their performance makes the movie attractive and worth-watching.
However it has some drawbacks.
The sense of comedy is highly extended , unlike in the movie Thor(2011) were Thor was serious in acting and communicating ,here Thor has passed the limits of comedy which spoils the movie and his goal, also the rock character Thor´s friend is unimportant his speech makes him childish and is trashing the movie. Also Mark Ruffalo not as Hulk but in original seems like he is acting the role not as an professional actor, his comedious performance makes him dumb and stupid.
In overall it is a good fantasy movie , worth watching and i recomend it to all fantasy lovers."

13 November 2019,harris-ryan-101,1,7,9,People Always Find a Reason to Complain,"Not sure how you can rate this movie so low. I have seen every movie in the MCU and this is one of my favourites. People complained about previous Thor films because of his lack of character, now they are complaining that this is not a Thor movie.
Much like Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie infuses comedy, fun action and a great soundtrack. It also happens to be truly visually stimulating the whole way through.
It's a comic book movie that couldn't be more comic book esque but people still find a way to chew it apart. This was a great way to develop Thor's character even more, and I expect more in his next solo film, Love and Thunder."
24 November 2017,anishsidi,1,6,9,Go and watch it.,"One the best movie of MCU. Thor franchise has never been exciting but this third movie has rebooted the style of our God of Thunder. It was a treat for a fan like me. And yes how can I forget the Incredible Hulk. He was into different Avatar. We always saw him in anger but over here he was laughing, talking, eating and doing so many stuff. Taika Waititi has delivered the movie with a lot of humour, action and emotion. It's a worthy watch and set a new benchmark for next instalment of Thor movies. And yes You will find the link to Infinity war during mid- credits and it will answer lot many questions which are bothering MCU fans for a while. So go and watch it."

                        ",A breathe of fresh air after two not-so-good Thor movies.,"7.8(mild spoilers ahead)Thor: Ragnarok is supposed to be horrendous. After two mediocre Thor movies presenting nothing but the bad side of Marvel films, Ragnarok would've been useless if it weren't so good. I expected it to be a terrible, overhyped and boring comedy. To my surprise, I was wrong.Firstly, all three acts are quite strong. The first act not only shows the new state of the MCU in Phase Three, but also presents the main villain- Hela. Cate Blanchett's performance was quite good, to be honest. The second and third acts were also well made. Even though the villain is introduced quite quickly and there is no real tension or plot twists, the movie still holds strong.Secondly, there is also a clear goal and a clear process to achieving that goal. The characters always strive to achieve that goal (except for Loki), and the villain always strives to achieve hers. Each character actually cares about the goal and don't let the comedy take over the main plot (as seen in Love and Thunder). Sure, there is some comedy, but it isn't prominent enough to turn a gritty, dark movie about war into another ""The Office"" remake. This movie keeps it's balance between funny and serious, unlike Love and Thunder.Thirdly, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. The problem with The Dark World was that there wasn't a lot of fun. It was always boring, mediocre and too dark to see anything at all. I really didn't like how they tried to change the tone of the movie to something darker at the cost of it's entertainment value.In conclusion, Ragnarok is the best Thor movie in the entire franchise. Forget about Thor (2011) and don't mind watching Thor: The Dark World (2013). This movie is the best out of the franchise and the only one you should watch. At least, until Thor 4 is on Disney+."
1 April 2019,juliovazquez-87700,2,7,9,Thor,I am a fan of all the Thor movies. Can I wait till they come out with a new movie
23 May 2018,theresews,0,2,9,I dare you to not have a good time,"First, we must get this out of the way: This movie is a comedy. It's not a drama, or a thriller, and definitely not a shakespearian tale. If you go into this movie with these expectations, you are bound to be disappointed. There will be no intricate plot, and no real heartfelt character moments. No string quartet swelling up, as you are about to cry. Instead, you will laugh all the way through it. Because this movie is incredibly cleverly written. You won't find jokes in here, that are misplaced, or feel as if they come at the cost of a plot. The story is well-rounded, relatively straight-forward, and it fits incredibly well with the comedic tone. The humor is clever, and never relies on crude elements to be shocking or provoking. Which can feel liberating, if you, like me, are tired of the Adam Sandler-Amy Schumer-Will Ferrel type of comedy. At this point I feel as if I have to point out, that the characters do develop over the story, and do not end up, where they started. Taika Waititi handles his characters with respect, and their actions never feel disingenuous. Therefore the movie also becomes more that just a comedic surface. Thor Ragnarok goes straight to my personal, permanent collection. It is a movie I can always watch, in any mood, and it always works. And if you go in with the right mindset, I DARE YOU to not have a good time."
31 March 2019,snuske-02873,2,6,9,Best Thor movie,I defenetly think this is the best Thor movie made. It's funny and I just like it a lot
16 June 2018,shivpsn,1,7,10,Awesome!!!,This is the best thor film by far. It is absolutely hilarious and the action sequences are amazing. The soundtrack is fantastic and it is an all around great film
3 November 2017,jordanbeeston,0,8,10,One of the best marvel films so far!,"Im a massive fan of Marvel over DC films purely down to the humour and serious balance that they have in their films. Thor Ragnarok had pretty much a perfect balance between the two, they knew when it was time to make you laugh but then most importantly when to get back into action and the plot of the film. sometimes too much humour can go the other way and make it cheesy. Great film, not just worth a watch but worth a 10 star review in my opinion!"
31 October 2018,reesek-83651,2,5,9,Thor Ragnarok,"I love this movie! It is funny, and entertaining. It was also confusing, but that was the first Thor movie I have ever seen. I have not watched to many Marvel movies, but it made sense most of the movie. If you are looking for a fun and funny movie to watch with friends and family, I highly suggest watching this."
8 June 2018,rtlehman,0,2,10,Southern Cross Humour at its Best,"The situational humour, the character interplay and egalitarian roles are divine. My favourite marvel thus far and I have seen them all."
25 January 2018,htshafiq,1,8,10,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!! Ragna-ROCKS!!!,"It's literally got everything you could ever want from a movie!!
Definitely the best marvel movie that I've watched to date!!!
There were some parts that made me laugh, some that made me cry - this movie is pure awesomeness.
And the actors were literally out of this world!!!!!
So go do yourself a favour, sit your butt down and watch this."
18 November 2017,bigbro-01025,1,8,9,never really liked thor but this was a fantastic movie,I went to see this movie and I wasn't expecting very much but however this was a really nice change it had everything good action comedy and characters I was really surprised and didn't exactly want it to end no I still am not a thor fan but this was an excellent time at the movies I say take the tweens and have a nice time you wont be sorry you did .just don't bring small children it could frighten them.
14 June 2022,jiminniekyutie,0,2,10,best marvel movie,"Wow!! It was so fun i loved it! Thor was finally made into a real character, i loved his and loki's sibling dynamic and hela was an absolutely badass villain. Also it was like genuinely hilarious. I would like Taika to direct all marvel movies from now on."
27 April 2018,mikewaims,0,1,8,Misunderstood,"I think both the reviewers who give this a low rating and the ones who give it a high score are both correct. The low score reviews don't understand that Marvel is trying to appeal to a wider adult audience ala ""Deadpool"". The high scorers like the comedy along with the story even if it doesn't fit in with the usual MCU."
2 August 2018,the482,1,3,9,"Superhuman fun, chaotic, hilarious and dazzling","I really enjoyed the previous Thor movies, although a little trite and Shakespearean at times, they were solid comic book capers, as much as you'd expect with a god in a big red cape.Ragnarok turns most of the previous two movies' straight style on its head. I genuinely laughed out loud a fair few times, Hemsworth really got his comic timing down great, and was clearly influenced by the director who almost steals each scene he's in as a kiwi rock creature.Brilliant stuff from all involved."
5 November 2017,Weewok,0,11,10,Mad as a bag of wasps!,Completely crazy! I am biased as I am a huge fan of the whole marvel universe but this was head and shoulders above most of the others. The comedy and action blended perfectly and the film never felt over long or sluggish. The director put his stamp firmly all over it and it worked perfectly. From start to finish I was hooked and just sat back and enjoyed the ride. I don't want to reveal any plot points I just want to say how good this film is and marvel fan or not it's well worth the watch. Also see it in 3d as it lends itself to the whole experience. Just go!
22 December 2017,Ayla_Pendragon,0,5,9,Well done everybody !,"Great fun at the cinema. Could not believe how Taiki Waititi, Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost elevate the series. Third time's the charm hun ?
The vibrant colors, the music, the humour (even in the most sad and inappropriate places), the themes (there were so many, refugees, displacement, ptsd from war, colonialism, lost of family, homes, friends...), the character arcs, the interactions of these characters, the heroes, the villains, the intergalactical worlds... Everything went 20 times better than Thor 1 and 2. Well done everybody."
16 November 2017,jewboyplaya,0,5,9,Best Super Hero movie !!! - From a genre hater,"Marvel/Disney has a clear hit with the extended Marvel universe sci- fi/fantasy. I you liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy, you will not be disappointed because this is better and doesn't suffer any laziness in writing. Whole movie is interesting.Movie gets an 8 from me, but for super hero movies it gets a 9.5, arguably 10.Not a big fan of 3D, but this one was worth seeing in 3D."
2 November 2017,leecehwan,0,5,9,get Thor's eye back,"the fights between Hela vs Surtur need more marvelous story if compare it between Surtur vs Thor, glad Hulk is communicative after long these times mostly raging, and surprised suddenly find Thor with one eye that losing Thor's eye is looked more to Pirates of The Caribbean which not as comical entertaining as Ragetti and better melt in Gods of Egypt (2016) ; may Thor's eye'll be back ..."
3 November 2017,dugfmjamul,1,12,10,Ragnarok Rocks,"Thor Ragnarok is the best Thor movie yet, hands down! Everything about it is outstanding, the acting, action, music, HULK talking, Thor funny, Loki likable, cool Viking Chick, snarky Grandmaster, wise Odin, funny Rock Guy ....everything! The only minor issue is, why do Asgardians have British accents and not Norwegian? With that said, go see the Movie and find out yourself why Thor ROCKS and the Hulk kicks the hell of out a Werewolf."
18 December 2017,domgwyther,0,4,6,A spectacular looking funny if somewhat superficial entry into the franchise,"After the luke-warm reception to Thor: The Dark World, Marvel has decided to shake things up in a big way for the third Thor solo outing, borrowing a lot from the studio's surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy films.Director Taika Waititi has made a frantically paced, colourful, comedy with Ragnarok, and the result is both a blessing and a curse.'Comedy' is the operative word here, with virtually every character delivering punchline after punchline as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) embarks on a quest to save Asgard from the evil Hela (Cate Blanchet). While the comedy is for the most part great and definitely delivers a fun time at the cinema, the film's need to get to the next laugh as soon as possible can sometime leave the dramatic or character elements wanting. While Thor, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the other Asgardian characters are dealing with some fairly dire circumstances and the potential destruction of their home, they're never too far from cracking a joke. It's ok that the film doesn't take itself seriously, but the characters don't take anything seriously either. Every time something potentially dramatic happens it's undercut by a punchline. It's as if Waititi feels the need to constantly remind the audience that 'This is dumb, and you're dumb for liking it'.Now if the alternative to the more comedic approach is The Dark World, (a grey, bland, melodrama with Kat Dennings for comedic relief) then I'll take Ragnarok any day. However the balance is a little off here. The film tries to beat Guardians of the Galaxy at it's own game, and doesn't quite succeed.Visually, Ragnarok is definitely one of Marvel's best entries, with a bright colour palette and some spectacular action sequences, the director uses every tool at his disposal to make each scene pop with on-screen creativity.The much advertised return of the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)is a definite highlight. As Thor is flung to the far side of space he encounters his former team mate in an alien gladiatorial fighting pit and, of course, hilarity ensues.Hemsworth and Ruffalo are on great form and the film is at its best when they are together. While neither actor gets anything particularly dramatic to do, they certainly prove they have comedy chops. I for one would love to see some sort of buddy cop movie with these two.Likewise Hiddleston is always good value as Loki and while Ragnarok may not be the most witty outing for the God of Mischief, its always fun when the sons of Odin get together.The new characters also make fine additions to the growing universe. Jeff Goldblum isn't so much acting as 'being Jeff Goldblum' as the Grand Master but that's far more entertaining than him phoning it in like he did in last year's Independence Day: Resurgence. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie does a lot with a small amount of screen time and while her arc doesn't quite have the impact it should in her debut outing, it'll be great to see how she develops in future installments.On the villain front however, Marvel is predictably lacking. Cate Blanchett should have brought some menacing gravitas to proceedings. Instead she is left on her own for most of the movie to monologue to a wasted Karl Urban (who really should have a bigger/better role in the MCU) and threaten extras."
16 April 2018,tannerbaumann,0,2,8,Wow,With a Guardians of the Galaxy feel this is finally a Thor film that delivered fun. Everything about it felt like the right marvel tone but it also was what this franchise needed. It proves all my theories wrong and for that i say thank you.
5 November 2017,simoniung,0,9,9,Thor Franchise Reborn,"A new era of Marvel has begun. Ever since The Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) James Gunn's masterpiece, the Marvel cinematic universe has taken a new approach. Adding colors and vibrant humor to their movies.Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is the ideal example of how a Thor Movie should be made. The first two were frankly disappointments with misplaced humor and over-hyped action scenes. However, Thor: Ragnarok is a thrilling experience. Visually appealing and hilarious, Taika Waititi has salvaged the Thor franchise. An incredible cast with the likes of Jeff Goldblum, who played the Grand Master splendidly. Action scenes that keep us hooked to our seats and hilarious characters that we look forward to seeing throughout the movie. Following a recent trend that can be observed in movies such as Baby Driver (2017) by Edgar Wright or Guardians of the Galaxy by James Gunn, Thor Ragnarok uses music to perfection.A part from the inconsistencies in some of the characters' backstories the movie is a must see for marvel fans out there!"
8 February 2018,draekingstn,1,11,8,Enjoying the humor while it lasts i guess,"It is apparently the best of the Thor franchise. But to be honest, I really didn't expect so much humor, even when some situations required seriousness and emotional connection to the story. But as soon as you feel the vibe you get cut off by predictable or unpredictable humor. I actually enjoyed it as a very entertaining movie with every scene. Most importantly i assume its building the moment for The Avengers Infinity War, where i expect more emotional connection and seriousness to the story. 
Like i said ""Enjoy the humor while it lasts"".Really cool movie"
25 March 2018,ezroberts,0,1,7,"Too much like guardians, but good","The opening 2 scenes seems off track quite a bit and then the movie gets very much like a hunger games/guardians of the galaxy mashup film, but overall still very good"
19 December 2017,BadMovieFan94,0,4,10,Exciting and Hilarious: A Huge Hit!,"This movie is amazing! It has everything a great action movie should have, and it's genuinely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. The acting is phenomenal, the visuals are spectacular, the plot line is captivating, the characters are enjoyable, and the humor is clever. Well done Marvel on an all around fantastic movie. Go see it!"
13 March 2018,Brunehaut,0,5,10,Most refreashing Marvel movie,"Let's be honest : I had painful memories of Thor 2. I found the character predictable, boring and Jane bored me terribly. So when a friend invited me to watch Thor Ragnarok, I was not sure of what I should expect. The thing is... I rarely had so much fun at the cinema. I even had difficulty to breath because I was laughing way too much. 
THAT is what Marvel can bring of best : self-mockery, absurd and hilarious situations, awesome characters (not only Loki this time, but I also loved Walkyrie (she is a very cool character, much more interesting and less cliché than Jane) and Thor suddenly became amazing, as soon as he exploited his comic potential). All the works on the superheroes clichés, clichés situations, clichés characters, all these sparkly and lively fights, this mixture of absurdity, eccentricity, clichés, fight and Led Zeppelin proved one thing : Marvel holds once again its supremacy under the superhero market.
A refreashing and must-see blockbuster."
7 April 2018,victor-14257,0,1,7,Such a attractively wired movie,"The director successfully made this movie far from being too serious or saga-like.
With the burden from last two movies discarded, characters in this one really have chemical reactions with each other.
However, the Waititi style jokes are sometimes disruptive.But anyway, it is absolutely delightful to see the most badass moment of the thunder god."
4 November 2017,onetwentyinnafiftyfive,0,9,10,A Spectacular Spectacle! (spoiler-free),"I watched Thor: Ragnarok last night in IMAX at AMC Tyler 14 (Tyler, TX). Full disclosure: I'm a Marvel and DC comics fan as well as a Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and DC Extended Universe (DCEU) fan (you can be both). At this point, it should go without saying it's essential the viewer suspend their disbelief prior to watching any of these comic book genre films. Otherwise, they'll likely walk away befuddled by not only the impossible feats but also the gross inconsistencies they'd just witnessed. In the same vein, and a perhaps a bit more difficult to establish, comic book fans need to suspend their understanding of comic book lore if they truly intend to appreciate the films for what they are. The comic book film genre covers characters that exist in all comic book eras from the golden age to the current. The story lines have vastly changed as have the characters. There are even factions of fans within the comic book realm that disavow certain eras. The films extract story lines and character relationships from all of these eras, but they do not duplicate, nor in many cases, even adapt these elements. If the films were ever to attempt to duplicate the comics, there would have to be a series for each era, in which there would be very few common threads.That was a rather long apologetic.While I tend to be somewhat antisocial, if not agoraphobic, Thor: Ragnarok lends well to being viewed in a theater among like-minded individuals. Now, this is not audience participation à la Rocky Horror Picture Show, but rather a little freedom to allow one's self to belly laugh at will. The word has gotten out that this film involves an abundance of humor, but it's not a comedy. Instead, the humor is used to disarm, and from the very beginning, allow the audience to relax and enjoy the ride. I'm not the first to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy, and that's for good reason. Of the 17 MCU films thus far, I pick out 4 that are outliers. These outliers don't deviate from the MCU cannon, but rather the mood and style changes. Of these outliers, Ant-Man was comedic and sleuthy. Guardians of the Galaxy (vol. 1 and 2) were more heart than humor with admittedly some heavy-heart moments particularly in the second installment, and Doctor Strange deviated due to its magical and psychedelic component. Like GOTG, Ragnarok is light and humorous. Despite the nature of the villain and its implications, the film is essentially devoid of any dark, foreboding doom. Unlike GOTG, Ragnarok's humor isn't so well balanced with heart. In this lies its charm. Thor: Ragnarok is a spectacle. The fact that one of the advertised main events literally takes place in a coliseum, is no accident and should be taken as a big clue as to what you should expect from this film. The actors' performances are so interwoven into the story line, I'll refrain from revealing much detail as to avoid spoiling any elements. Some of these elements are highly dependent on the surprise factor. That said, I got more from Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Mark Ruffalo than I'd ever expected. Tessa Thompson is now on my radar, and although unlikely, I'd love to see her in a solo Valkyrie film. She could carry it. Then there's Jeff Goldblum playing, well, Jeff Goldblum. He's exactly what this franchise needed. That's all I say on that.If you are even a casual fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, you'll likely enjoy this one. If Guardians of the Galaxy is higher and Thor: The Dark World is lower on your list of favorites, Thor: Ragnarok is certainly a must see for you. GOTG probably remains my favorite because it plucks all the right strings at all the right times. However, Thor: Ragnarok feels like the needed exhale preceding the impending Infinity War."
8 May 2018,kjlang127,0,1,5,Was this film trying to be as cheesy as Flash Gordon (1980)????,"This movie was a cheese fest! Campy all the way through. It was hard to finish watching it, but knew I had to since it ties into Infinity War. I'll give it a five stars because Josh Brolin, Cate Blanchett and Tessa Thompson at least made their scenes watchable."
22 November 2017,brahmadewasakti,1,6,10,The Dark Knight Reverse ?,"Thor : Ragnarok is very interesting plot with light and fun, reverse from The Dark Knight where plot is heavy and serious. Maybe Thor : Ragnarok is very funny movie with best plot I ever seen. Great cast with great story, All cast is really fit, even Sir Anthony Hopkins is excellent."

22 November 2017,bigbro-37844,1,6,9,one of the best,OK I will admit to the fact that I usually don't like thor movies but on the flip side I really had fun watching this one I laughed out loud I felt a huge rush from all the action going on its really good trust me I cant believe how wicked awesome this was its also family friendly which is perfect my only word of caution is be very careful taking young kids due to the fact that they could be frightened bu the villains and the end battle is also quite graphic and thor almost dies so not for kids who are sensitive or ae attached to thor but its a blast of a movie and your for sure gonna love it
5 November 2017,npocmaka,0,8,10,Full of illogical stuff,"Asgardians are hard to kill.But Hella's zombies kill them easily.Which on the other hand are easily killed by supposingly low-tech M16'a akimbo. Party spaceship from a junkyard planet was able to detect the refugees from Asgard, but the super-powerful Hella (with the advanced technology on her side) was not.All population of Asgard could be put in a spaceship slightly bigger than a school bus.Thor was not able to break the glass of his cell until his electro- shock implant was removed.But was able to beat out supposingly one of the most powerful creatures in the MCU."
22 February 2021,dankano-58941,1,5,7,Liked it but it wasn't enough,Like the first two movies were really great and everything. But it seems that the acting in this one went downstairs even though the plot was really promising. It was okay.
16 November 2017,pzhuwang,0,3,7,"Fun movie, but great?","Thor Ragnorak is about Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, was defeated by Hela, played by Cate Blancette, and lost his hammer. He is imprisoned by Grandmaster, played by Jeff Goldblum, as gladiator and he must fight Hulk to gain his freedom. As of now I have seen this movie twice and I have made up my mind about this movie: it is fine. I felt like I had a great time with it and it has a lot of potential to become a memorable MCU movie for me like the Guardians, winter soldier and the Avengers. The humor was great, probably the best out of all MCU movies. I loved the 80s electro soundtrack. Reminded a lot of music from Kung-fury. It also reminds me a lot of Deadpool, in fact, I felt this film almost become a PG version of deadpool at one point. I loved Jeff Goldblum, I loved his mannerism and the best actor in the film. Everything he does brings joy to me. I really like Tessa Thomason and I felt like she is a great addition to MCU cast and I hope to see more of her in the future. Mark Rufflo was amazing as hulk plus Bruce Banner. This is a more comedic Hulk we used to know from the cartoon and they did have a lot of jokes about Hulk in the past MCU movies, such as the relationship between him and Black Widow. Bottom line, all acting are great and every scene took place in Sakkar, the Hulk planet, were perfect. Notice I said scenes in Sakkar are great? Because the stories is Asgard is very generic. And that is one of the down points. The film sometimes felt like two different movies pasted together, when it took place in Sakkar it felt like a great comedy, but in Asgard it felt like generic and almost boring MCU drama. Without giving anything away, the outline of story is very similar to the first Thor movie. Hela was OK but forgettable like most MCU villains. Some the effects remind me more of a blizzard production rather than a big budget movie. At times I felt like watching a cut scene from Warcraft. Overall, I liked it. Had the film took place in Sakkar the whole time, I would even say that it is a top tier Marvel film. The serious moments really don't work well and it felt like a sore thumb compared to the amazing comedy. If you haven't seen it. Go check it out, you will have a great time. I will give it a 7.5/10"
3 November 2017,rushtoabhinav,1,7,8,Good plot.,"This movie is amazing. Chris Hemsworth really did a good job as Thor, The presence of Hulk is entertaining and the valkyrie is powerful. Kate as Hella turned out to be a good villain. There is a surprise waiting for you in the movie and I am sure it will give you chills. Definitely worth a watch. Waiting eagerly for Black Panther & Avengers Infinity War to release."
26 May 2018,mile-madarac,0,0,3,Could have been good,"Comedy poorly placed and felt incoherent. And Cate Blanchette, such a poor choice for that role, she was just terrible. Watch only if its part of your cable or streaming service."
4 November 2017,savannahrich,0,8,9,More Fun than Expectated,"This latest installment of the Thor franchise was better and funnier than expected. Better, in the form of more spectacular scenes and great performances by the cast. Cate Blanchett was not recognized, it was excellent, an Oscar-calibre performance by her. Let's not argue about mythological accuracy, because besides the characters and some names, all else has been new fantasy, for this movie. Be sure to see it."
8 May 2018,wkleweno,1,2,9,Thor review,"When I go and watch a movie one of the things that I want is the film to be fun. And this film Thor: Ragnarok, is a very fun ride for me. The director ,Taika Waititi excellently blends his style of comedy, seen in his previous work like the Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, with the action and formula seen in the previous Marvel films. Where the other Thor Films fell short because of their overly serious tone and lack of interesting environments for the characters to interact with. Ragnarok does the opposite, taking some ques form other Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy , the film adopts a very fun and ridiculous tone. Introducing characters like Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is a classic Goldblum Character with his fast-talking wit and charm, the psychopathic leader of the planet is played in a way that makes me excited when he is on screen as he is that magnetic in the role. Also, the reinvention of the character of Thor himself. Making him a fun-loving and witty character as he has the character in the past has been often forgettable in the previous films, often being outshined by the comic reliefs or the other characters with more to them. Waititi takes his previous experience of working on small New Zealand independent comedies and translated the storytelling method to the big budget action films of Marvel. He maintains the themes of his previous work to make the action franchise better. The themes of outcasts of a society trying to fit into a world that does not get them is strong in this film as Thor quite literally has to fight for his freedom in the film. Thor: Ragnarok is a different Marvel Movie, instead of a flashy action movie concerned with special effects and the battle for the fate of the world, the film tells a human story of finding someone's own identity through tragedy and the classic Marvel action and set pieces, all while being an amazingly fun ride."
13 May 2018,mszcat,1,2,3,Comedy?,"Didn't know it was gonna be a comedy, some parts for me felt like it was a game. Then the main thing that ruined it for me was the music, I seriously thought Shrek or Snow White was gonna come out. The whole family especially the kids where laughing so hard, if you watched Shrek 3 you'll understand."
15 May 2019,gjerdingen46,2,8,10,Fkn awesome,One of the best Marvel-movies ever made. I laughed through the whole movie like crazy.

Lively action sequences will keep you engaged from start to finish. The laughs flow throughout the movie, but the humor doesn't seem overdone. I found the movie just as funny and engaging as Guardians of the Galaxy; maybe even more so.The cast, perfectly selected, will keep you entertained at all times. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant, combining humor with sex appeal seamlessly. Cate Blanchett is simultaneously powerful, evil, and irresistible. Taika Waititi himself is a hilarious addition as the rock man, Korg.The special effects and computer animation make you feel like you're right there in the action, regardless of how over-the-top the scenarios might be. Throughout the film I found myself marveling at the magnitude of the design, color use, and lighting. These elements work together to create something truly alluring. Overall, I had a great time watching this movie and would highly recommend it. Great job Marvel, Waititi, and cast."

Infused with new ideas like what Cars 3 did.I really love hollywood for that. They do not go on one formula to make money but they explore what could be the next. People are ready to get amazed.No wonder Marvel movies are way to entertaining and on the same time making it a marvelous moment .
1 March 2018,pollitopluma,0,3,10,Thank Odin for Kiwis,"Marvel fan and comic nerd that seriously enjoyed this movie. Went to see it while I was out of the country and had several people all different nationalities laughing audibly during the movie. It was NOT what you expect of a Thor movie but I felt it was an exciting change that took advantage of the ridiculous and strange thing that Thor sees and says. Some of the jokes were cringy, but most were casually funny. When I marathon the Marvel films I'm going to look forward to having this one have its turn. I would love to see at least one more movie like this one and hope other movies dont take themselves too seriously, we are talking about comic source material I dont want to see too much edgy super hero or too much dancing clown, this was a nice middle."
22 July 2018,staceysummers,1,6,10,Thormazing,"This is by far one of the best Marvel films ever made. The humour throughout is hilarious, great new characters and the music fits perfectly with the new planet that gets introduced. Watched it again last night and loved it even more. A must watch!"

So powerful and artistic representation.One of thebest movies of mcu. Give it a try
Despite action , there's adventure and comic."
2 December 2018,thanosroussis,0,1,6,Too many jokes,It is a pretty good movie the main problem for me is that they did too many jokes. I think that the comedy element was a bit much. The plot was nice though. The acting also was good.

                        ",Missed comedy moment,"At the start of the film, Scourge is showing off his posessions, including a scooter. Why, when he was running across the causeway to the castle, didn't he decide to go by scooter instead. Not like he could run fast and hunched up on a scooter heading for the castle, would have been comedy gold"
5 November 2017,neha-saxena1997,2,9,10,Most fun I've had in the cinemas since a long time.,"This movie was such a delight to watch. Excellent cinematography, brilliant fight scene choreography and awesome background score. The humorous moments were very funny too , and unlike some people who claim that the jokes were misplaced, I found the comedy very endearing (probably because many of the scenes were actually improvised by the actors). Plus, we finally got a proper ruthless villain - Hela. Cate Blanchet slays (quite literally) as the Goddess of War. The story was engaging and it also brought a sense of closure to the journey that Thor has been on. Taika Watiti did a great job in directing this movie and making Chris Hemsworth the best version of Thor yet."
18 August 2018,jeffersonsixx,1,4,8,Awesome Sound & Visuals,Watched in 4K ... I really liked this movie but I generally steer clear of these. This was a good surprise - actually watched it three times now.
23 February 2022,leemichael-53531,1,8,8,Innovative for an Avenger movie,"The comedy mixes well with the story telling. Loki's character development in both Thor: The dark world and Ragnarok give depth Thor movies need to add much of its drama. Some of the comedy seemed forced, but most of it fit in and could be excused for genuine story or character detail. Hela was a little bit bland for a villain. She didn't have any real weakness, depth, or purpose for her actions besides revenge and greed. Smart to change Thor's style a bit comedic wise and make him more box office friendly. It's a fine change from other Avenger movies, because it's still a piece of entertainment, and it's fine to lack metaphors to go for a comedic approach to story telling. Not every movie has to take itself serious to be artistic in its own ways."
19 November 2017,habiba_ch,1,5,8,"Guardians of th-- Oh Wait, Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint","I have had some problems with the previous Thor movies - found them a bit boring and couldn't really care about anyone except for Thor and Loki. But ever since I saw the trailer for Ragnarok, I knew it would not disappoint. And it really didn't. This comical take on the movie definitely deserves an applause for bringing Thor up to par with the rest of the Marvel movies. Also, LOVED listening to Immigrant in each and every scene. There are a lot of people who are complaining about Ragnarok being depicted as a 'joke'. And to be honest, it will remind you of the Guardians of The Galaxy movies - but that's far better than watching the tedious scenes in Thor 1 and 2 which truthfully made them the weakest Marvel movies. Before anyone decides to watch the movie, I think they should know that there are definitely a few questions they won't find answers to. It might make them angry or a bit annoyed, but it is the sort of movie that you watch only for the sake of fun. You don't watch it to try to comprehend the situation but only to enjoy it as it is."
1 July 2022,moreberlin,0,0,10,Best Movie in thor series,Director took the story to another turn but this is what we wanted to see in a thor movie. Very nice story line and great acting. Both we and thor got to know his real power :D. He doesn't need weapon to be such powerful he's god of light not god of hammer. Cast matched all well and sibling chemistry was super fantastic.
5 January 2022,soroush-51439,1,4,10,Goldene Waage,Ein ungewöhnlicher Solo-Marvel Film mit mehreren Charakteren . Viel Humor und trotzdem gleichzeitig viel Emotionen.Viel Farben und super Schauspiel-sklis. Hammer Regie und super CGI.
20 October 2018,anupama-32555,2,7,9,Awesome!,"I loved this movie! It was funny and entertaining with great performances from the cast. You can see a totally different version of Thor and the changing equation between Loki and Thor.
Many are complaining that it is too funny for an apocalyptic movie, that the theme was not taken seriously etc.But, I'd prefer to see apocalypse this way.
The music and stunts are amazing too. And Korg was an unexpected surprise. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson - so many memorable performances. It was absolutely awesome."

The first two movies were ""Jane Foster"" movies with a little bit of Thor sprinkled in. I wish the previous two movies had been centered on Thor and not Jane. This movie struck a good balance between seriousness and comedy."
13 November 2017,jaydevdesai,1,7,9,Obviously much better than Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013),"A hell of a lot of humour makes this movie one of the funniest movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). A great job done by director Taika Waititi.This movie gives you the colorful cosmic universe of MCU, great laughs, great fights, a much better villain (Hela) than Malekith, Loki, Thor, Hulk and also Korg. It's an awesome movie for MCU and Marvel fans."

19 March 2018,cburrows87,0,3,9,Brilliant,"One of Marvel's Best films to date. They finally did Thor some justice! This whole film was amazing. Taika Waititi is a genius, and I'm so glad Marvel gave him this opportunity to direct it. He nailed it! Soooooo much better than (the incredibly disappointing) 'Black Panther'.Seriously... Black Panther was not that good.
This. This is all sorts of great!"
7 May 2018,Saminislam,0,1,5,Thor: A Joke!,"Thor : Ragnarok, a movie that should be darker then Thor: The Dark World, is basically a comedy movie about sibling rivalry and bromance! This movie instead of focusing on the plot goes all over the place bringing up and blending stories from all sort of comics (If this was DC we would be bashing it for blending stories). It focuses on fight scenes and jokes rather the building up a foundation. All we came to know was Hela is evil and Thor is good! So, the must fight on Asgard for Asgard! We also get a discount version of Planet Hulk because Thor vs Hulk is good for advertising! All we came to know is that Valkyrie was a Valkyrie (a discount and cheap version of Amazonian's)! The story never focused on the plot rather then jokes, more jokes and more unnecessary jokes every 5 minutes. A serious moment, let's add a joke! I love Taika Watiti, but this is not the Thor the fans need, this is marketed for 5 year old children who want Hulk and Thor smash and their parents who want to laugh. At some point i was wondering if i was Thor or Guardians of the Galaxy. If this was DC. we would be moaning and avoiding it.
In short, if you want pointless fun this is for you, if you are a fan you should be furious."
21 January 2018,kashyapsolanki,0,4,9,Too much humor,There should not be this much humor it's started to feel annoying
8 July 2018,gingerprincess69,1,4,10,Guaranteed to cheer you up,Lots of hate for this film- why? It's awesome! Funny and had completely rescued the Thor franchise. Chris Hemsworth has amazing comedy timing and the supporting cast are amazing! I suggest going back to watch this after infinity war- much needed tonic.
24 November 2017,mattymoll,1,6,9,Marvel continue to get it right,"If there is one thing Marvel get right it is humour. You can always sit comfortably knowing that the movie isn't going to take itself too seriously and that you're in for a good time. Its packed full of laugh out loud moments - not just from a few characters, most of the cast made me laugh at some point.But that isn't the only thing Marvel get right! Everything from the cast to the action and the FX are insurmountable. I just don't get the same warm, fuzzy feeling watching any other super hero movies.If there was one negative for me, it was Skurge. I just didn't connect with the character at all and his role felt forced or even a bit of an after thought.But that's me really digging for negatives and I'm looking forward to watching again over the holidays. Go watch this film, more than once, you won't regret it."
17 February 2018,luanamardesic,4,23,10,Amazing,"This movie had everything i love about Thor, the sibling drama, the awesome fight scenes, the weird, but amazing humor. Cate Blanchett was an actually amazing villain, something Marvel lacks these days. And Korg, oh my god, Korg. That guy deserves a movie of his own."
4 November 2017,jainmanish-57186,0,6,8,Good but not a great movie!! Still a must watch,"Story: In the movie, there were few loose ends where one cannot comprehend why and how this can happen but most of them got sorted later. It was consistent. Overall a good story line though it had a generic comic of age type feel to it.Hero: This probably is the best performance by Chris as Thor, he really seemed to enjoy it. He did mostly what was expected from a hero. He is not shown as outright witty which makes him do dumb things which makes it more real.Antihero: 'Loki' by far is the best Antihero in have seen in any comic book movie. Sometimes he would do thing too dark to appreciate but Tom is such a great actor. Always nudging the hero but making the right decisions when they are neededVillain: This is another Marvel Production where there was not enough character development of the Villain, it still didn't feel that the character have layers despite the fact that Cate is such a great actor.She was extremely overpowered which also makes parts of the story incomprehensible.Jokes: There were so many jokes and references to old MCU movies. Some of them will make u Laugh out but some were extended far too much. I loved the jokes overall, just hated the fact that most of them were predictable as they tried to overstretch them.Action: Action scenes were crafted well, most of them I would say. Some shots were too close to feel (even in 3D).Music: Right from the theme song to the moments in the movie, It made perfect sense. It actually charged the audience during the fight scene.Overall, It is still a must watch, it meets what was presented in the trailer but still, it fell short from being the best MCU movie."

13 March 2018,xamiell,0,4,7,It's like: The epic and funny adventures of Thor.,"Good movie, but comedy is everywhere and most of the time is present, that means you cannot appreciate the moments of suspense."
5 February 2018,vereleyj,1,9,8,So funny!,"I went into this with low expectations, thinking it would be the same old tired repetition that Marvel keeps churning out, but boy was I wrong! It was so funny! Like Guardians of the Galaxy is doesn't take itself too seriously, and is a breathe of fresh air. I also really liked how it's more science-fiction than action. More of Marvel's films should take a similar approach."
3 November 2017,enuen,0,4,8,Better than the first and second,"While the predecessor was just plain horrible this movie is a far cut above both the previous ones. The villain is memorable and the supporting characters add a great substance to the plot. Also Hulk as the sidekick is outstanding, he is not just some stupid shallow character with unlimitless power as I felt he was in the other movies. This time you get more in touch with his personality.In short it has a variety of characters which in my opinion actually makes it better than the first Avengers movie. Let me elaborate as to why I find it better, everyone in The Avengers is a wise-cracker with comeback lines, the sorts of comeback lines I find funny if they are used moderately, however they just become dreadful if they appear everywhere. Yea, the Fast and Furious franchise is probably the worst series I have seen... And I still remember Lokis final ""No.. thank you"" from Dark Worlds, it makes me close my eyes and face-palm myself every time. To summarize it is worth seeing on the big screen and I would rate this movie somewhere between 7-8."
4 November 2017,tud-81143,0,13,10,Amaaaaazzinggg,"Seriously, Amazingggg!!! One of the best YET! Thor is getting better and better!! Very Nice Marvel!!

Seriously worth it because it is so good!"
3 November 2017,daisimalone,0,6,8,Embrace the silliness,"This is a great movie, but you have to be prepared to embrace the silliness. If you want a serious superhero experience or a profound philosophical provocation then don't bother to watch this one.It is silly. It's very silly. There are wacky and random Easter eggs, off beat humour, and great action scenes choreographed to a music score that screeches 1980s sci fi.Most of all, this is a fun escapist adventure with a couple of groan worthy moments but fewer than appeared in GOG2. If you're looking for a 2 hour holiday from the everyday, then embrace the silliness, enjoy the startling visuals and then go home and question how such a ridiculous narrative actually reached the screen. Then thank kiwi director Taika Waititi for having the guts to produce it.Go and enjoy a unique experience."

The other action sequences weren't as good as other's such as Civil War, or Winter Soldier, but made up for it with an easy to follow story, and a divisive plot that will have you wondering what may happen next. This movie was not given a 10/10 due to the fact that some parts weren't as ""good"" as some, being in the first 20 minutes of the movie, but picked up the pace with it's humor and story, as well as Taika Waititi's character, who is one of my favorite characters in the movie."

4 February 2018,rtdepiazzi,0,5,7,So much fun,Ive seen a number of articles from people talking about superheroes movie being the exact same as the last one but Thor ragnarok proves those people wrong by being a unique and fun super hero movie but it's also very funny I also feel that Thor is a much stronger character in this movie I also can't get over how out there this movie is through out the story Thor travels to other planets and instead of fighting boring robots or something Thor gets into entertaining action scenes with crazy looking aliens and also hulk of course I think the one main thing that keeps this movie from being amazing was hela while not a week villain isn't exactly anything that we haven't seen before but over all this movie as an incredibly funny and entertaining movie that is total worth watching

What I liked about the Hulk even when I was boy was not the muscles, but the anger ND the horror ND the disability of talking , it's a like a comic virsion of the night king , but in this movie , not only they made him talk , but they made him laugh , make jokes , say the words "" sorry"" ND "" please""!!!!!
I felt like I don't know the character , honestly if u compare this version of the hulk to his from the movie The avengers , u wouldn't find a single similarity."

19 April 2018,radke-85004,1,3,10,By Odin's Beard this Movie was Ragnarok'n!,"This movie at the moment is my favorite MCU movie of all time. Why? I'll tell you why. This movie is FUN! This movie is FUNNY! This movie is RAGNAROK'N! As any comic book movie should be. The director/writers had the imagination of a child when making this movie which is why it succeeds above all expectations. Sometimes acting like a child can be a good thing. Children tend to have bigger imaginations. This is how I've always imagined a comic book movie looking and sounding like when I was younger. The colors are bright and powerful. The costume designs are flawless. The soundtrack is really cool. Everything in this movie felt just right. Yes, the plot was a little cliché, but the comedy and movie references made this movie hilarious and worth watching. From the Willy Wonka references to the Jeff Goldblum mannerisms to Hulk's childish behavior; there was never a dull moment. I honestly was not a fan of Thor in the comics, perhaps now he is my favorite character. The first two Thor movies cannot even compare to this one because they lack the ""Fun"" aspect. This movie set the bar high for the rest of the MCU movies to come."

Thor: Ragnarok is an exactly this type of film - an excellent two hours which never takes itself too seriously, provides plenty of action and an abundance of laughs.I'm not a hardcore Marvel movie fan (and I've read reviews from hardcore fans who feel this movie fails to meet their requirements), but this is exactly the type of film I enjoy.The banter between Thor and Hulk was spot on, while the funny references to other Marvel characters are subtle and hilarious. Korg (voiced by Kiwi director Taika Waititi) is a consistent scene stealer, and Jeff Goldblum is perfectly cast as the mischievous Grandmaster.After watching this, I feel the need to revisit other Marvel titles (which will take up my next few nights), and I highly recommend this excellent film."

29 January 2018,shspahiu-1,0,3,7,Skuer,"There's a nice bit in ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" the latest Marvel blowout to feature the god of thunder, where he tries to start a jet using a voice-activated password. He needs to make a getaway - he's neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements - so identifies himself as the ""strongest Avenger."" No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he'd copped to being the ""most boring Avenger.""Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor's former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). ""Ragnarok"" tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons"
27 January 2018,joze-maucec,1,7,10,Totally cool,"I must say that this movie did surprise me at the begining because it laked seriousnes. But if you think that this actually came from comics - come on it is great. Lots of action, jokes and entertainment. It is never supposed to be some melodramatic saga but something out of comics. I am taking the risk that diehard comic enthusiasts will be angry with me but I personally believe that every comic that I read and will read has to entertain me at least partly make me laugh and not be too heavy to enjoy during my free time. And that is something that this movie succeded 100%. Super and 10/10"

Great action, and I like the historical part or it is better to say myths part of the plot, but I am not quite sure in it, I will read it in a free time. Watch, it worth some time"
17 November 2017,DeltaDeeW,0,3,7,"Good movie, though it has its problems.","Thor Ragnarok was overall a good movie. It had better visuals and soundtrack then most Marvel movies normally do. However, I personally think that Marvel movies are focusing too much on comedy, which works for Spider-man and Guardians Of The Galaxy but not really with the others. Don't get me wrong, a few jokes here and there are good and all the jokes in this movie where actually really funny. My main issue with the comedy is how it trivialised the whole threat of the movies and made most of the characters look like complete buffoons. As I said it works in Spider-man and GOTG because the characters have always been like that, its what makes them stand out from the crowd. Anyway, putting the comedy aside. The characters as always where awesome, I think that this film showed the best version of hulk ever, the dynamic between Thor and Loki worked and the grand master was just fantastic. As I said the soundtrack had a massive improvement, not quite at John Williams or Hans Zimmer level yet, but baby steps, at least they didn't over use it like Dark World did. The cinematography was well handled and the effects looked nice. Overall it gets a 7/10 from me, which is still a recommendation. If you want to see it I think you should."
3 June 2019,u-75385,1,11,8,Finally! One of the Best Live-Action Comedy Marvel Movies,"When the first ""Thor: Ragnarok"" trailer came out, I had zero doubt it will be one of the best films in 2017. The big and colorful movie pictures and its funny trailers made me anticipate for the film. Just like I thought, the movie did not disappoint me. The comedy and live-action scenes really brought me on my feet. In my opinion, the main focus of this movie is comedy followed by live-action.As Thor is one of the main characters in ""Avengers,"" the audience had some expectations on how this film will turn out. They were not disappointed, as the Rotten Tomato score and the result of the box office is there to prove its greatness.""Thor: Ragnarok"" is about Thor and how he saved Asgard. At the start of the movie, Thor was put in a dilemma when Hela-the powerful villainess-tries to take over Asgard. Thor was imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his hammer, as he tried to defeat his ally-the Hulk-to return to Asgard and prevent Hela from destroying his home. During the process of returning to Asgard, Thor faced many difficulties. Only by overcoming these difficulties can Thor safely return to Asgard and fight off Hela.The film did receive some criticism on the storyline. As most Marvel movies are funny and entertaining, they followed their storylines. ""Ironman,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" and ""Captain America,"" were amazing because they built upon their existing storyline. It made the viewer want more because they are curious about what is going to happen next.Chris Hemsworth played a major role in ""Thor: Ragnarok's"" success. Hemsworth fits the role of Thor perfectly. In fact, he brought out his all in this film when the new directer-Taika Waititi-steps in. His acting brings out emotions and touches of laughter. In every ""Thor"" film, his deep voice and funny jokes are what attracts the viewers.However, what happens when you paired a funny Thor and an oddball? Hulk was put into action in this film. In my opinion, the funniest part of the movie is the fight between Thor and Hulk. Thor can still crack jokes while fighting, making the audience laugh. From the actions between Thor and Hulk, we can see the strong brotherhood between them. This kind of brotherhood continued onwards to the film ""Avengers: End Game"" as Hulk persuaded Thor to go back and save the world. This is one of the scenes that touched the audiences' heart.Taika Waititi-the director-did a spectacular job in directing this film. Since this is his second time coming in contact with Thor-related films. His first film about Thor is when he wrote, directed, and produced a short film ""Team Thor."" ""Team Thor"" garnered a lot of attention as most people enjoyed it. I can see why Waititi is chosen to be the director of the film.""Thor: Ragnarok"" is one of my favorite movies of all times. I am sure most people who watch it will agree with me. The live-action and comedy really brought out the film's shine, as it did shine for me after I saw it for the first time. The reviews for previous Thor films had been average. However, Taika Waititi has not disappointed me and the audience. Taika Waititi and Chris Hemsworth did an amazing job in showing me such a spectacular live-action comedy."
22 January 2018,frankklitgaard,0,1,7,Get your facts straight!,"Ok and fun movie, But!
Odin doesnt die until the final battle of Ragnarok. The whole thing is predicted.

Just saying."
23 November 2019,x-48673,1,6,10,WHY ALL THE 1 STARS?,"I was kinda bored watching the first movie, fell asleep watching dark world. But I loved this movie. Was one of my top favorite mcu movies. Had awesome action, cool effects and hilarious dialogue. I can understand people not liking that kind of thing and maybe rating it 5 or 4 stars. But 1? As in worst of the worst? I even saw reviews highlighting a few positive elements, yet still rated it 1 star. 1 star movies have no redeeming qualities. I look at reviews on IMDb alot, and this is one of the biggest misrepresentations of a film I've ever seen."

5 June 2018,arnab_mg,0,3,9,Nice one,I have liked this movie very much. It has fulfilled my expectation.
3 July 2022,kimberlymgracia,0,0,10,Best one.,This is easily the best and funniest Thor out of all them. And now I can't wait for Love and Thunder since it's directed by the same person who directed this movie. One of my favorite Marvel film.
26 February 2018,mierawr,0,3,7,It's fun but cut the humour,"After watching Black Panther, I still prefer Thor : Ragnarok. But Civil War and Winter Soldier are by far, the best for me.I mean, it's not bad... the flow of this movie. The intro was cool, and the climax was okay but the plot got dragged out and the concept hence the title ""Ragnarok"" wasn't put into context as much. I just wish they reduce the jokes.At some point, I'm glad there isn't some romance in the third movie. It's a whole lot better without Jane since I don't like the second movie at all. The third one has become an improvement."
10 November 2017,hailme-75755,0,9,10,Laughed and enjoyed this very much,"I was impressed by What We Do In The Shadows and went along to see Ragnarok based on that film. I also enjoyed Hunt for the Wilder People. I was delighted that Ragnarok managed to combine ancient Gods, special effects and automatic weapons without being utterly naff, for example as in the dreadful Prometheus. Anyway Ragnarok was great. I laughed out loud. I've laughed this way two times before: firstly, watching Wolf of Wall Street and secondly, reading The Rosie Project...a guilty snorting laughter that makes tears creep out the side of your eyes. Ragnarok broke my expectations by being witty throughout. This is so rare. Wonderful."
24 January 2018,corralesm,1,7,10,BEST. THOR. HAMMERS DOWN.,"This movie was visually stunning, funny, and definitely the best of the trilogy! The movie was full of surprises, and the addition of the Hulk to the Thor franchise helped not only his character development, but also that of Thor himself. Chris Hemsworth definitely deserves a lot of credit for brining his character to life. Hela was surprisingly a good villain, something the MCU has suffered from in some movies. The movie satisfied the Thor: Ragnarok storyline from the comics pretty well (which is good for those who follow the comics pretty closely!)Looking forward to see where Thor's story goes from here."
2 December 2017,bsanthoshkumar,0,2,7,Jokey marvel....,"First of all the movie is fun and awesome the movie but watching it in different angle its like new Zealand director's power rangers movie. The director should be in the mindset of writing the story in comedy mannerThor: The god who struggling to save the Asgard from his own sister. While watching the movie we will think that Chris hems worth is hero or comedian that's a doubt.SPOILERS:The god of thunder is defeated by some electricity this is the most silly thing about Thor otherwise he is awesomeLoki: oh God Loki is fu... Stiff in this movie he is not like in thor1,2 and avengers SPOILER:he is an freak about hulk by watching him in fearHulk: I want to ask why director has made Thor look like stand up comedian this is the mistake in this movie making hulk more easier in this movie i hate its role in this movie Sorry i forgot to tell about hella she is awesome but she has less appearance in this movie about 28 min high or less she awesome to meGuys please watch this movie it so fun. If you guys wanted to watch some logical and story type you don't want to watch it"
3 November 2017,asifmammadovv,1,8,10,Well done Thor!,"It is fair to say that this movie exceed my expectations. When the trailer broke the record as the most watched trailer, I was worried that it is going to be one of those movies where all of the good scenes have been added to the trailer to bait viewers. Even though I like my hero movies more on the serious side, the humor was spot on. It made me laugh countless times. There was a story line to follow and revenge of the Valkyrie was just perfect! I really enjoyed Heimdall's involvement and showed us what a real guardian looks like! Overall, definitely recommended and one of the best superhero movies in a while!"
15 December 2017,kingarthurscott,0,3,8,Fun movie,"Wasn't sure what to expect before watching this. But yeah, prob one of my favourites in marvel cinema. The dialogue mostly felt 'natural'. not woodenly scripted like past movies. Cate was an awesome villain - something MCU had been lacking in past films."
30 November 2017,andrewhorne-79978,1,7,10,Awesome!!,"I absolutely loved it!! It is really funny - I am pretty sure I laughed the whole time! It was really colorful as well. The other Thor movies were pretty good but this one blows them out of the water! I was really hoping it would be good with the great acting list, but I was not expecting the movie to be this good! This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies ever!"

17 July 2018,katiepoynter,1,6,10,THE BEST!,"I recently begun to watch all the marvel films in order and have only just reached this one, I was never sure of Thor in past films - he was good but not my favourite and this film has just blown my mind!! It is hilarious like laugh out loud funny (which I didn't expect from a marvel film except deadpool). IMO, this is the best marvel film to date along with civil war. Thor: Ragnarok just fully exceeded every expectation and I could watch it again and again!"
7 October 2018,joestanbell,1,5,10,Great and funny,"Really funny movie, I also love the character Korg. I also had great casting with mostly only New Zealand and Australians."
22 February 2018,damien-21897,1,6,9,This movie is garbage.,"Or so I thought before entering the cinema. My opinion was based on the previous movies which were disappointing to say the least. Besides, I didn't know anything about that director, Waititi...Peculiar name.However, Hemsworth's acting skills were starting to grow on me thanks to the Avengers movies and Civ-Sorry. Thus, I went to see Thor: Ragnarok and boy was that the best cinematographic decision I took in 2017.If I were to pick a word to define the movie, it would be ""well-balanced"": the comedy, the action scenes, character development, and so on...This movie was awesome."
13 November 2017,maxballer,1,7,9,Excellent movie compared to the last two Thor movies,"If you have anything against the iconic super hero, Thor Son of Oden, or have the notion that he is ""the weaker link"" in the Marvel Cinematic universe, you may want to reconsider when deciding to go see Thor: Ragnarok or not. This addition to the marvel movie collection is a refreshing addition to Thor's storyline, and instantly combats the claim that Thor is a ""boring superhero"". Thor: Ragnarok is a step in the right direction if you're wanting to watch an entertaining and comedic driven approach to super hero movies. The movie starts with Thor's father, Oden, dying in his presence. Because of his death the evil goddess of death, Hella, invades their home world. Unexpectedly Thor's hammer is obliterated by her and he is thrown into another world. While in this foreign world Thor makes allies in order to escape and return to his home world to save his civilization. What I liked most about this movie is that in the most epic fight scenes they never failed to include a classic rock song to really pump up the adrenaline. Along with great music, the visual effects are outstanding and really convince you that this world from another universe is real. There cannot be enough emphasis on the comedy in this movie, it is a step above the Guardians of the Galaxy type humor and it really changes the mood of Thor for the better. However, one flaw I did find in the movie was major plot line, the start, middle and end was like every other superhero movie; this movie distinguished itself by changing up how they got from each phase in the plot. In recent memory the character Thor has been heavily criticized but in this edition the director gets it right and makes him more relatable, funny and just the right amount of cockiness to spice things up. I highly recommend watching Thor: Ragnarok, not only for its outstanding characters and visual effect, but also for the very satisfying special character appearances and surprises."
30 June 2022,kaitoq-03481,0,0,9,Taika saved Thor,Taika Watiti really did save the Thor franchise. This movie was almost perfect and I cant wait to see what he will do with the next one (plus any other MCU entry he works on)
10 November 2017,violetuk-993-367326,0,9,9,Blew me away.,"First time in forever that I wasn't waiting for a movie to end. It was magic! The acting was fabulous, and I am unable to say enough good about this movie. There was humour. There was action. There was character development. There was redemption. There were even surprises, which is an accomplishment in this day and age. I plan to go see it again, and given that I see maybe two movies in theatre a year, it says volumes."
29 January 2018,rosenbergmatias,0,2,7,Just fine.,"It was OK. Fun but I didn't really care much for the story. Perhaps not the most memorable movie in the MCU, but a good time anyways."
12 November 2017,kamran-super98,0,11,10,another marvelous movie by Marvel,"Another masterpiece from marvel. The humor used excellently in this movie movie really exceeded my expectation.

Helen is amazing.Best villain I ve ever seen since the Joker (dark knight) for me, Tessa Thompson stole the show amazing actress."
7 March 2018,sabretooth29483,0,1,7,Somewhat disappointed.,"I love Norse mythology and the Thor movies but I feel the ruined this movie by having Hela as Odin's firstborn instead of having her as Loki's child as she is in the myths.

10 March 2018,ozcanserdarcan,0,3,2,Another Marvel Movie to Enjoy,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a classical Marvel movie to enjoy, which managed to win the affection of audience. It takes no risks from beginning until the end and sticks to the basics of the MCU: funny jokes, above average character development, offers good time. As a result, it worked, people liked it. This movie is a perfect fit for people's sense of entertainment; because it made them laugh, because it had great visual effects, because it gave them a ten minute subject to talk while drinking coffee and because it gave them something, which was easy and didn't force their minds. To put it in other words, it was another Marvel movie to enjoy but nothing more."
9 November 2017,k_m_rahman,0,11,10,Best movie of Marvel Studio,"I didn't know that a superhero movie can be so much funny . This movie contains love , emotions , bonding , history and overall actions ... Genre of this movie : Comedy , thriller , sci-fi , action .

10 June 2018,Lightsbane_IMDb,0,3,9,What a pleasant surprise.,"An absolute visual and audial spectacle and a thoroughly enjoyable ride, from start to finish.
Ragnarok never takes itself too seriously, and it works, because I haven't laughed this hard watching a super hero movie, in a very long time.
Highly recommended."
3 March 2018,thareen-17141,0,2,9,Reason that i gave 9 star,"It more like a comedy film but there are some touchy scene in the film related to Odin the father Character. the hulk flew across a the universe by the Quin jet and by the way no one said that in avengers that could fly in to space. Otherwise the Climax Action is a major effect job and all the characters such as Thor, Hela, Loki, Valkyrie, hulk, Grand master, hamdele they all did a great job and a great performance. Also it's worth to Watch"
7 March 2018,bhaisukaddu,0,3,7,Good Movie.,"The film is good. All the character are balanced except for Hella. I think there could be more to her. She looks plain and her charaterisation lacks appeal, at least for me .
The Hulk part was on another level. I found it fitting , funny not overdone and more verbal than previous installments. 
Chris 'Thor' did a great job.Overall I'd say movie is good and enjoyable."

It's definitely better than the previous Thor movies and Hulk makes the movie just better. If you like both comedy and action then this movie is for you. I gave the movie 8/10 but only because there was a bit too much comedy for my taste and I would like to see more of the Hulk smashing stuff.
But overall I would definitely recommend this movie."
29 November 2017,peter-09557,0,4,8,"Without a doubt the best Thor movie, but to much space","The movie is very different from the other movies, but still catch all the god parts from the privious movies. The humorous moments of the movie is hilarious, and had me laughing every time, but this don't stop it from being an action packet and story filled marvel movie. The one thing i don't think fit the movie, was the amount of space/ sci-fi in the movie. I don't think this was to much over done in this movie, but a tiny bit more, and i would be to much, for a more medieval and Nordic Mytologi based movie, like it is suppose to be."

I was extremely excited to watch this movie.
But now after watching it , I'm kinda despondence. I expect something more than that. Actually I think the new series of Avengers destroyed my hunger. For me Thor Ragnarok was like a bridge that try to bring Avengers Heroes together. It was like watching Guardians of The Galaxy with this difference that In the Guardians we see gun battles but in Thor Fist and sword battles. I mean if somebody entered to my room and Watched TV , He was gonna say : Is That a new Guardians Of The Galaxy!!?
I think only thing that Persuading me to watch Ragnarok for the second time is its comedy and humor. should consider that it supposed to be a SuperHero Movie not a comedy. 
I don't know why I have a bad feel about Ragnarok! in fact it wasn't that much bad but it didn't answer my expectations. In my deep heart I'd love Ragnarok but I prefer to watch ""The Dark world"". Taika Direct this movie on it's best way but The Story should've been something more powerful than this. 
I hope It don't happen to Infinity war. People Come this far to see something extremely perfect.
